Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead. James Hurley : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Roger Farah, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of the quarter; Chris Peterson, our Chief Financial Officer will provide operational and financial perspective on the first quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2014; and Jacki Nemerov, our Executive Vice President, will provide merchandising highlights and comment on some broader strategic initiatives. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger N. Farah: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter results that we are reporting today continue to demonstrate the resilience of our diversified operating model. Despite an uneven global operating environment, we planned the business prudently and continued to make significant investments in our long-term growth objectives and in the infrastructure to support them. Ralph and I are proud of our team's accomplishments, especially since we made important progress on several of our key initiatives during the quarter. We expect our recent investments in new stores, e-commerce operations and international expansion to continue to accelerate sales and profit momentum in the second half of the year. And we are confident that the investments we are making today can support profitable, sustained growth for us over the long-term. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some operational and financial perspectives on the first quarter. Christopher H. Peterson: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter sales and profits we're reporting today are slightly better than we expected, and I'd like to start with a recap of the financial results. Consolidated sales grew 4% in the first quarter. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and unfavorable foreign currency translations, revenues were 6% higher than the prior-year period. This was slightly better than the low single-digit growth we anticipated due to better-than-expected wholesale revenues in North America and Europe. The cold and late start to spring resulted in sales trends that were somewhat choppy throughout the period, with business strengthening when weather conditions were more seasonally appropriate. While traffic to brick-and-mortar stores was challenging, growth in e-commerce continued to be very strong for both our Retail and Wholesale segments. Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 increased 1% to $1 billion. Gross profit margin of 60.7% was 160 basis points below the prior-year period due to the integration of the Chaps men's sportswear operations and unfavorable foreign currency dynamics. Operating expenses of $728 million in the first quarter were 4% greater than the prior-year period. The higher operating expenses primarily reflect overall business expansion, costs associated with newly transitioned operations and continued investment in the company's strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure, all of which was partially offset by disciplined operational management. We also had a $16 million gain on the acquisition of the Chaps men's sportswear license. This onetime gain was included in the first quarter and full year outlook we provided in May and will mostly be amortized in subsequent quarters. Operating expense rate of 44% was 10 basis points above the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating income of $276 million was 5% below the prior year due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments in the company's strategic growth objectives, the Chaps integration and negative FX impacts. Operating margin was 16.7%, 160 basis points below the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The operating margin results were better than the 200 to 250 basis point contraction we anticipated back in May due to stronger-than-expected productivity gains in certain areas of the organization. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $181 million, 7% below the $193 million achieved in the comparable period of fiscal 2013. And net income per diluted share declined 4% to $1.94. EPS of $1.94 was better than we anticipated due to higher revenue and stronger profit flow-through, a testament to the operational excellence of our teams who are still contending with a relatively challenging global retail landscape during the quarter. Moving on to segment level details. Wholesale sales grew 6% to $735 million in the first quarter, primarily a result of the contribution from the newly transitioned Chaps men's sportswear operations and continued growth in core North American merchandise categories, which continue to gain market share. Product-wise, Women's wear and accessories were the most important contributors to Wholesale revenue growth in the quarter. A planned reduction in shipments to certain European customers and the transition of certain Japanese wholesale distribution to directly operated concession shops partially mitigated wholesale revenue growth during the quarter. Wholesale operating income of $154 million was in line with the prior-year period, as improved profitability in North America was more than offset by lower international profits and Chaps transition costs. Retail segment sales rose 3% to $879 million in the first quarter, reflecting the incremental contribution from new stores and strong growth for e-commerce operations. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and foreign currency, Retail sales increased 6% from the prior year. Consolidated comparable store sales declined 1% on a reported basis and were up 1% in constant currency during the first quarter, on top of relatively challenging multi-year comparisons. We estimate that the earlier timing of Easter this year negatively impacted our comp growth by approximately 2%. With the exception of e-commerce, customer traffic trends were soft across most Retail formats during the quarter. However, strategic marketing efforts, along with the investments we've made in in-store technology and customer service, enabled us to mitigate lower traffic levels with improved conversion and UPTs at most of our retail formats worldwide. Comp store sales were stronger at directly owned Ralph Lauren factory and e-commerce operations and weaker at concession shops in Asia. Retail operating income of $160 million was 11% below the prior-year period, as costs associated with the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts and foreign currency effects were only partially offset by disciplined operational management. Licensing revenues of $39 million were 8% below the prior-year period as lower Chaps-related licensing revenues offset higher apparel and fragrance royalties for Ralph Lauren products. Licensing operating income of $29 million was in line with the prior-year period. Consolidated inventory was up 9% at the end of the quarter, largely due to the newly acquired Chaps business and new store openings. We spent approximately $66 million on capital expenditures to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments. Free cash flow of $229 million in the first quarter was 11% greater than the prior-year period. The company repurchased about 850,000 shares of its common stock during the first quarter for an average cost of approximately $176, utilizing $150 million of authorized share repurchase programs. At the end of the quarter, the company had $427 million available under previously authorized share repurchase programs for future buybacks, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments. We made important progress on several initiatives during the first quarter. We completed the pilot conversion wave of SAP. This included global product procurement and North American Wholesale operations for a group of pilot brands and involves transferring millions of pieces of data, including inventory, purchase orders, sales orders and accounts receivable from legacy systems to SAP. The pilot implementation went very well with data conversion rates between 99% and 100%, and we are now fully on to SAP for the pilot brands. Based on the pilot's success, we are proceeding with the next wave of implementation later this quarter, which transitions a more meaningful portion of the company's brands and merchandise categories. As we articulated last quarter, we are taking a staggered approach to systems conversion in order to proactively manage the risk profile of the project. Over time, we believe SAP will yield productivity improvements and procurement savings in addition to providing the company with a stronger platform for future growth. The integration of the formally licensed Chaps men's sportswear operations has also gone smoothly. We worked on an accelerated basis over the last few months to take this business in-house since it is an important component of the overall Chaps brand. In a short period of time, we've successfully on-boarded about 50 new employees and established dedicated warehousing and distribution capabilities to support the business. We're now at a point where we are migrating from a costly transition services agreement to a wholly integrated and directly managed model. At the beginning of July, we assumed direct control of Ralph Lauren operations in Australia and New Zealand from our former licensee. As a result of the license take-back, we've integrated approximately 300 new employees, 13 stores and 20 shop-in-shops across the 2 countries. Although we have already incurred some upfront costs associated with the transition, the full financial impact of managing Australia and New Zealand will be reflected in our results beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. It's clearly been a productive start to the year. Before I review our outlook for the balance of 2014, I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate that despite the formidable challenge of a cold and late start to spring around the world, we had a good spring-summer season and we're able to exceed our sales and profit plans for the quarter. The balance and diversity of our merchandise assortments, as well as the lifestyle positioning of our brand, which tends to emphasize a total sensibility over a single item, allowed us to offset softness in certain seasonal classifications such as knits and sandals, with strong performance in other categories such as dresses and denim. In addition to strong performance for the Ralph Lauren brand, the Chaps brand also had a fantastic quarter across a wide range of merchandise categories. As Chris mentioned, the integration of the Chaps men's sportswear business into our organization went smoothly and is, in fact, one of the fastest transitions we've ever executed. Chaps is $1 billion brand at retail with representation in over 40 merchandise categories, and we're excited about the growth it represents for the future. With direct control of the largest and most strategically important merchandise categories, we believe that we can further enhance the clarity and consistency of the brand to drive even stronger productivity gains and achieve merchandising and marketing synergies with our customers. The success of Chaps in North America over the last several years is a clear demonstration of the enduring value of trusted brands that deliver consistent quality and great value. In order to more fully leverage the power of this brand, we are building a plan to expand the distribution of Chaps around the world. I'm pleased to share with you that we have an agreement with a distribution partner in Mexico to launch Chaps in that market in both retail and wholesale locations next spring. This is the first step in an exciting new journey for Chaps, and we've received tremendous interest from other potential partners around the world, so there will be more to come on future calls. Now I'd like to spend some time on exciting developments on 2 of our strategic initiatives. The first being the evolution of our omni-channel approach to servicing the customer, and the second being an update on some of our non-apparel merchandise categories. With regard to the omni-channel, you already know that developing our worldwide direct-to-consumer presence is one of the most important long-term strategic growth objectives. We've invested substantial amounts of capital and operating expense to build both retail stores and online shopping experiences that are unique to our brands and distinctive to the consumer. During the quarter, we opened 2 high-profile Ralph Lauren retail locations in China, a spectacular 10,000 square-foot Men's flagship store in central Hong Kong, with an impactful 6-story facade and a 5,800 square-foot Men's and Women's store at L'Avenue in Shanghai, which is a new first-class retail and office complex. Both stores will showcase our luxury apparel and accessories in a powerful way. China is one of the company's largest and most compelling long-term growth opportunities. And the foundation of our strategy is a retail expansion that will require significant investment in both stores and e-commerce capabilities in order for us to be properly positioned in the market. As you know from our approach in the U.S. and Europe, our stores, both physical and virtual, are critical expressions of our brand, so the decisions we make in China are extremely important to the future of our luxury business. Last quarter, we spoke briefly about retail strategy for our Polo brand that would allow us to more fully represent that aesthetic across men's, women's and children's merchandise. We believe that a dedicated retail expression for the full breadth of the Polo brand will allow us to better serve a diverse customer base. Our existing luxury retail stores offer a smaller assortment of Polo and only for men, and those locations attract a customer who's really drawn to our Black Label and Purple Label products. The creation of dedicated Polo stores will provide the right environment in which to represent the sensibility of this powerful brand, with a full product line across not only men's, but also women's and children's. Given the broad appeal of the Polo brand, we believe that there's potential for these stores in many locations around the world. We opened the first dedicated Polo store in East Hampton during the first quarter and it's off to a great start. As we embark on the first phase of a multi-year plan to leverage the tremendous global demand for our Polo brand, several more retail projects are planned around the world, including a 35,000 square foot flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York. We are also excited about the continued global development of our Denim & Supply brand. We opened 2 Denim & Supply stores in the United States during the quarter, one on University Place in New York City and the other on Newbury Street in Boston. They joined a fleet of 15 other Denim & Supply retail stores, 8 in Europe and 7 Asia, and complement our worldwide wholesale distribution. Denim & Supply is a relatively new brand that resonates with the 20-something millennial audience. The product is fresh and distinctive, but grounded in the quality and the authenticity of Ralph Lauren. As far as the brand has come in its first 2 years, we believe there is considerable room for additional stores. In another aspect of our plan to fortify our omni-channel approach, we're on track to launch e-commerce in South Korea later this fall, which will represent the 14th country in which we are e-commerce-enabled. We have invested in e-commerce-capable distribution centers in Italy, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul to support additional ship-to markets throughout Europe and Asia. We will also be opening our greatly expanded distribution center supporting our North American e-commerce operations this fall. Over the last year, we've invested about $75 million in capital to build a facility that can support the doubling of that business. Because we view our retail stores and e-commerce sites as not only important commercial ventures but also valuable branding vehicles for us, we believe it is imperative that both merchandising and marketing messages be aligned. To ensure this, we've invested in the technology and the distribution logistics capabilities that allow us to integrate and leverage the unique power of our product distribution, our inventory and our brand messages. Today, a customer in one of our stores works with a well-trained sales associate who uses an iPad to easily and quickly offer additional options that he or she knows are available online but that the customer is not seeing right there in that particular store. That additional option could be as simple as a size or a color or it could be a style or a label not sold in that location. The combination of sales associates who are knowledgeable across the entire portfolio of our products and technology that enables easy access to a single pool of shared inventory is a winning formula. The customer's experience is richer and more dynamic, and our productivity and profit margins are stronger. And of course, as technology and distribution capabilities have evolved, so, too, has the customer -- the consumer behavior, and we know that the customer explores, browses and shops our brand across these channels and that their expectation is one of alignment and seamlessness. We are very focused on servicing and delighting our customers wherever they choose to shop for Ralph Lauren. To that end, the investment we're making in our customer intelligent platform is focused on realizing a holistic view of our customers, so we can service them in a brand-centric, channel-agnostic manner in real time. Our omni-channel thought process extends beyond our directly operated retail business. Over the past several years, we've architected and executed a highly successful application of this omni-channel view with our wholesale partners. And it's been an important driver of our growth and success together. As you're well aware, our largest wholesale partners are focused on integrating their physical stores with their e-commerce operations. We have partnered with them to support those endeavors with fully integrated merchandising and marketing strategies that reinforce our brand's leadership position, both within their stores and on their sites. Now turning to our merchandise categories beyond apparel : handbags, footwear, watches, jewelry, eyewear and fragrance. I want to update you on our continued development and investment. You've heard us talk about handbags, small leather goods and footwear because they have been among our fastest-growing categories and represented approximately 8% of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2013. We are pleased with the credibility the Ralph Lauren brand has established in a relatively short period of time in the highest tier of the luxury leather goods market, and are also focused on building a strong platform for sustainable long-term success. This fall, you will see a lot of activity around our most iconic handbags, the Ricky. Launching in the next few weeks is a complete world of Ricky story built around a greatly expanded range of handbags and small leather goods products inspired by this signature bag. A high-impact, multichannel global advertising, marketing and public relations program featuring the recently introduced Soft Ricky style will be impossible to miss. The introduction of the Soft Ricky has already been a great success worldwide, and we are building upon its appeal with this introduction of a broader range of sizes, colors and related items for the fall and holiday seasons. Beyond luxury handbags, there's also momentum for other accessory categories. Building upon the worlds of Ricky platform in leather goods, we are leveraging some of our most iconic brand themes to develop new watches, eyewear and fragrances. This spring, we had a great success with 2 of our new watches, the Safari Chronometer and the Steel Link Stirrup. The high level of consumer interest in these new styles has increased exposure for our entire watch collection and had a beneficial impact on the business. The Safari aesthetic was also the inspiration for our latest eyewear collection, where both optical and sun styles were introduced into the line and were well received by the consumer. Ralph's passion for the design of fine automobiles was the inspiration for our newest men's fragrance, Polo Red. The fragrance and its messaging has been huge hits with consumers, and the early success of Polo Red will be supported this fall with substantial television and magazine advertising. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Christopher H. Peterson: Thanks, Jacki. We are pleased to be starting fiscal 2014 with strong progress on several long-term objectives and sales and profits that are trending slightly better than planned. As you will recall, fiscal 2014 was planned with increased investments in the business to support long-term shareholder value creation. Key areas of investment this year include accelerated retail store and e-commerce development worldwide, the transition of formally licensed products and regions to directly controlled operations and upgrades to our management information systems to support our long-term growth objectives. Based on the timing of our specific projects, we continue to expect fiscal 2014 to evolve as a tale of 2 halves, with the first part of the year characterized by lower sales growth and outsized investment spending related to the integrations of Chaps and Australia/New Zealand and by preopening costs for new stores. We expect accelerated revenue and profit growth in the second half of the year, with the benefit of revenues from new store openings, the launch of our South Korean website, expanding the number of countries we can ship to from our European e-commerce operations and the transition of Australia/New Zealand as a directly operated region. As we articulated in May, the combined year-over-year impact of the incremental investments we are making in new stores and e-commerce platforms and in systems upgrades on our operating profits is approximately $75 million for the full year period. While this step-up in spending will weigh on our near-term operating profits, we continue to expect each of these investments to deliver a rate of return that is well in excess of our cost of capital. For the full year fiscal 2014 period, we continue to expect consolidated revenues to increase by 4% to 7%, which includes 150 basis point negative impact from foreign currency effects and a roughly 100 basis point additional headwind from discontinued operations. Our full year fiscal 2014 operating margin is still expected to be 25 to 75 basis points below fiscal 2013's record level. The year-over-year contraction in the operating margin outlook is primarily due to the integration of newly assumed operations, accelerated investment in our various strategic growth initiatives and FX impacts. Excluding the impacts of the incremental investment in the company's growth initiatives and foreign exchange, underlying operating income growth would be up low-double digits for the year. We continue to expect the fiscal 2014 tax rate to be 31%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a low single-digit rate, with Retail segment sales growing at a mid single-digit rate and relatively flat Wholesale revenues due to a shift in the timing of certain wholesale shipments out of the second quarter and into the third quarter due to the SAP implementation. Foreign currency is estimated to negatively affect revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the second quarter and will continue to have more of an impact on our Retail segment given its geographic business mix. Discontinued businesses are estimated to mitigate second quarter sales growth by an additional 100 basis points. Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 300 to 350 basis points below the prior-year period due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments to support the company's long-term strategic objectives, the integration of formerly licensed regions and product categories and the foreign exchange impact. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 31.5%. We've established aggressive goals for the year, laying critical groundwork for the future. Our global teams continue to demonstrate strong operational discipline as they not only manage the day-to-day, but also support the important progress we're making on key long-term initiatives, particularly our global omni-channel efforts and infrastructure upgrades. With that, we'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I'm hoping you guys can comment on looking at the top line overall for the company, it's been a little bit soft for the last couple of quarters and you obviously got all this great kind of global long-term growth opportunities. It seems like there was also a little bit of discrepancy, Wholesale top line versus Retail. What gives you confidence in the kind of this re-acceleration you're going to see in the back half? Are there certain elements either within the segmentation of different brands, regions, channels? Just kind of give us an update on your overall kind of view on this top line re-acceleration that's coming. Roger N. Farah: Okay. So, Omar, I'll try that, and then Jacki and Chris can chime in if they want to add. I think you're right, in the last couple of quarters, for various discrete reasons, we've had the results as you commented. While we delivered the plan for the first quarter, I would say that spring/summer was a bit choppy in terms of overall trends in the apparel market. On a regional basis, it was interesting because it was pretty good in the U.S., actually better than expected in Europe, with Asia being down. And that was really a combination of strong results in the early days of China and Southeast Asia, but weaker results in Japan and Korea. Some of that being FX, some of that really being the shop-in-shop businesses that dominate both Korea and Japan. And I think those 2 markets and the department store distribution network in them experienced contractions. And so really, it was a series of different results around the globe. As we head into fall and holiday, we feel good about the product early reads, and I know it's early for fall, have been good. We're seeing the strengthening of key markets in Europe. We've had some good wholesale pre-books in Europe beginning to flatten out and then grow the forward bookings after several seasons of contractions there. We've got some strong product initiatives as Jacki articulated. And so we're feeling like, in the go-forward business, we'll have less of the one-offs that we've experienced, plus the addition of Chaps for Men's, plus the addition of Australia, plus the launching of some of these e-commerce sites where we've been carrying the expenses and haven't gotten the revenues. And lastly, and this is true for most people with businesses here in the U.S., we're going against the effects of Sandy, which did impact part of the fall season last year. So for lots of reasons, the underlying trends of the last quarter with the Easter shift, which is sort of unique to us because of the way it splits between March and April, and some of the FX, we delivered the plan perhaps not as much as we had hoped but I think we're encouraged about fall and beyond. Christopher H. Peterson: The only thing I would add is that this next wave of SAP, which we're implementing toward the end of the quarter, is causing us to shift a little bit of our revenue, particularly in the Wholesale business, out of the second quarter and into the third quarter. So we're going to shift some shipments out of the last week of September and into the first week of October. And that's having a little bit of a split impact between the second and the third quarter revenue guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Roger, this is somewhat answered in the first question but I wondered if there could be more, a little bit more detail. I know last year, around the time of the second quarter, you had decided to pull back some products from Europe because of the state of the world there at the time. Are those sales returning in that region? Roger N. Farah: Okay, Kate, well, you know I love detail so I'm glad you asked. I would start by just giving you a sense of the trends in Europe. We have talked in the past about sort of a general strength in the North and a little bit softer in the South. And while that continues sort of as a headline, we actually have seen this season, France get a little softer than it's been in the past, but strength in Germany and the U.K. and the Scandinavian markets and other markets have actually encouraged us. We proactively pulled back really on 2 levels. One, countries that are dominated by specialty store distribution like Italy where the specialty stores were struggling, and we were very cautious about putting product into them that, quite frankly, we might not have gotten paid for. So we really worked to proactively reduce that. We worked with our better specialty store customers, but that was a decision to balance inflow of product and the risk of not getting paid. And, quite frankly, we've managed that beautifully. In the department store channels, countries that are dominated mostly by department store distribution, which is Spain and Germany, parts of France and the U.K., as their business has been soft, excluding Chinese tourists, we worked hard to get the inventory turns and the supply and demand in alignment. And as I briefly said in the beginning of my comments, we're beginning to see that turn. And the go-forward bookings in Europe are encouraging in the places we're choosing to sell. So after several quarters or a year of contraction, that was strategically applied to the wholesale channel. We're beginning to see that reverse in the go-forward product categories, countries and regions. So I think that's good news. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Two questions. First, Chris, the 100 basis points you called out of headwind from discontinued operations, the headwind to revenues, it sounds like it's incremental just because I didn't see it when I looked back at the fourth quarter, is that new? Maybe you could tell us a little bit what that was? Was that in the original 4% to 7% guidance you gave last quarter? And then secondly, on the transitioning of Chaps, I'm wondering if there were any adjustments that you made to inventories that perhaps you weren't expecting -- that was the gross margin impact maybe a little bit more than you thought in the quarter related to some inventories you had to clean up. If you could just help me with that. Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. Yes, I think on the first question, the discontinued businesses are really primarily Rugby, which we had called out previously. I think we felt like we wanted to provide a little bit more specificity in the guidance on how much that discontinuation of Rugby was impacting the guidance. So it's not new news, it's just a -- additional sort of perspective on -- that we wanted to share with the Street. So that's the primary piece of that. On the gross margin impact and Chaps impact, it kind of came out as we expected. So you saw in the release that we had $16 million gain. Part of the way the accounting worked is because we terminated the agreement early because of the PVH and Warnaco merger, we had to take a step-up in the inventory along with a number of other items that resulted in a gain. The inventory that we shipped out in the April, May, June period, we then recorded higher cost of goods. So part of that gain wasn't really incremental, it was a shift out of the cost of goods into the gain number, but that $16 million gain wasn't all incremental. And we knew about that because we had negotiated the contract with PVH prior to our May release, and so that was included in our guidance but there is an underlying gross margin impact that's about what we expected because of that step-up in inventory and then you ship out and incur higher cost of goods than what the going cost of goods level would be. Operator : Our next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie. Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research : Just questions around Retail. It looks like a lot of the Rugby stores were sort of re-purposed for some of your other growth initiatives. Is that, first, is that correct? How many were there? And what do you think about unit growth for this year, what should we be looking for? And then it also looks like there are quite a number of licensed stores opening under Club Monaco and some under Ralph Lauren. But to the extent that you have licensed stores opening, how do we sort of avoid some of the missteps that licensed partners have made in the past in terms of opening appropriate locations or not being appropriately positioned? Kind of how are you working with these guys to make sure that they get it? Roger N. Farah: Okay, Liz, let me try that. We re-purposed probably half of the Rugby stores. And those stores, some of which became Polo, for instance, East Hampton and Short Hills later this fall. Some of which became Denim & Supply, like Newbury Street or University Place downtown. And about half, we closed. The bigger news there is that while it's certainly early days, and Jacki touched on this in her opening remarks, we're feeling very bullish about the opportunity for Polo as standalone Retail. We've had Polo for Men's in our own Ralph Lauren stores, albeit smaller as we've expanded our luxury presentations. But standalone Men's and complemented with Women's Polo, which will be part of our fall strategy, is a very exciting concept for the customer. That will be displayed at its pinnacle on Fifth Avenue next fall. So we have 25 stores in the pipeline for this year to open worldwide. But the probes into Polo stores and Denim & Supply give us a very good feeling about the commercial viability of a high store count growth in the future, which is different than looking for luxury locations. Within our current performance this spring and heading in, the United States and really Europe had pretty strong Retail results. It was really offset by the shop-in-shop concession numbers in Japan and Korea, which we include in our Retail comps, that really dragged the business down in total. So when you put aside some of the moving parts with FX and Easter, the low single-digit positive comps were really stronger in the U.S., stronger in Europe and a little bit down in total in Asia, obviously supported by a very strong e-commerce growth. So there are levels of detail underneath the headline numbers that I think give us some confidence we're on the right path. Operator : Our next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Could you provide some color on the marketing plans for the China business, and some color on how the stores have performed in their initial ramp phase? Roger N. Farah: Yes, we have opened a number of stores over the last year, 1.5 years. Obviously, a lot more to come. China is running about 18% ahead. So Southeast Asia is also running mid double-digit, mid-teen double-digit increases, so we're encouraged by the early reaction there. That includes stores in Vietnam and Malaysia and some other markets. While it is still early days, we did open what we call a flagship in Hong Kong, in the Prince's Building, which is a dramatic statement about our Menswear. We had a soft opening in June. We'll have a bigger push in the fall, and that's had tremendous early reaction from the customers. And surprising to us, strong sales in building and furnishings. I think most of you know that the China customer today, and the male customer is the dominant customer, is more casual in dress, but we've had very good early success in clothing. So we expect to begin to ramp up the marketing plans, print, as well as store activities starting in the fall but really coming out more strongly in calendar '14. That's when we're planning a series of large store openings in the fall of '14 in Shanghai and in Hong Kong, and it really will represent a more complete coming-out party for us. Operator : Our next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Just a couple of quick questions, just a follow-up, Chris. If you can quantify the net impact on the gross margin from Chaps, I know you mentioned 2 moving parts there? And then secondly, Roger, you called out Women's as one of the stronger businesses, Women's and accessories. Accessories not a surprise, Women's, it sounds like it's getting stronger. I just wonder if you can comment on what you're seeing in the Women's business. And was Men's not called out because it was weaker or it just wasn't as strong as Women's? Christopher H. Peterson: So I'll take the Chaps. The total impact to the gross margin on Chaps was about 120 basis points in the quarter. Roger N. Farah: I'm going to ask Jacki to maybe touch on some of the product initiatives that you asked about David, and then we'll go from there. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: David, we have seen a strengthening across our entire Women's business, starting with our collection in Black Label business where they are starting off with quite a good fall at this point year-over-year. Our Lauren business had a very, very strong season, up high-single digits off of a very substantial base. As you know, we are the #1 brand in the department stores and continue to grow in that position and in that floorspace. Our accessory business, I commented on in the script, as our luxury accessory business with the centerpiece of the Ricky, which has done extremely well for spring, and we pretty much had sellouts. We're re-delivering now all of our fall colors. And I don't know if you noticed in the Sunday Times, but we had a fabulous Soft Ricky ad this Sunday. And that is now just the beginning of what we expect to see around that product for the fall right through the holiday season. We're putting a heavy emphasis on our accessory opportunity. Our Lauren accessory business had a very, very strong spring season, and it looks like a good lead into fall. And because of that, we are seeing additional store rollouts and, as I said, real nice double-digit increases in our Lauren brand as well. For anyone who wants a real treat, take a trip down to Macy's Herald Square to see our new Men's Polo shop, which was just opened on Friday. And it has -- it is a 10,000 square foot shop opened off of the new Seventh Avenue Men's door coming up into the shop on the second floor escalator right into the Men's shop. Dramatic presentation of all of the lifestyles that we see in our Polo customer, and from the most casual to clothing and dress furnishings and new accessory area that we installed in this Polo shop. And I think that speaks to how we feel about the opportunity, the continued opportunity in our Men's business. We had a very nice season off of our obviously very large based business, and in most stores ran a mid to high single-digit comp over prior year. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : I just wanted to follow up from an investment perspective as it relates to SAP and recognizing the staged approach you're taking, are there more front-end loading of the investments particularly in Q2 than maybe were previously implied? And then just from the remaining investment as we think about it for the balance of the year, how should we think of that kind of progressing as we get through the next 2 quarters in the back half? And then just a second question kind of on some of the longer-term growth opportunities, particularly in Denim & Supply, as this brand has gone more into Retail and as that continues to grow, can you speak a little bit more about what you're learning about that consumer in particular? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. I'll take the SAP question. So the year-over-year spending on SAP is a significantly higher spending that's in fiscal '14 versus what we did in fiscal '13. I think we've said the combination of the investment in SAP, the new stores and the e-commerce platform is $75 million increase versus last year from those things combined, and SAP is a significant portion of that $75 million. If you look at the SAP spending, the SAP spending is a little bit more front half-loaded in the fiscal year than back half-loaded because of the timing of the waves that were going through implementation. This wave that we're going to do at the end of September is really the largest wave that we've got sort of remaining for this scope of the project that we're looking at. And so there will be -- it will be spread out through the quarters but it will be a little bit more front half-loaded. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: On the Denim & Supply consumer, Erinn, what we are really seeing is that the department store customer, our customers are focused on really driving this millennial customer into their stores. What we are seeing is a very strong and early reaction. For instance, in Macy's in Denim & Supply, we are in the Impulse department, which is focused on that millennial customer. In Men's, we're in the Young Men's area, sitting next to Levi. Both of those businesses have been tracking very, very strongly, Men's and Women's, in the department stores. We opened 2 locations in this quarter, one in Boston and one in New York for Denim & Supply, and off to a very good start. And we believe that there will be many stores following that. We have stores that have opened in Europe and in Asia, also performing very well. So what we're seeing is that certainly, within the Ralph Lauren brand in the Denim & Supply aesthetic, we've really been able to engage with this customer. And as I said, the sell-throughs, the product mix, the nature of and the exciting look of that product is clearly engaging that customer. We have a very interesting marketing campaign with the DJ Avicii, who is a very hot DJ in that market. And what's happening is we'd actually just launched this amazing video that has gotten millions and millions of consumer reactions to it. And it's extremely well done, and Avicii will be part of our fall campaign, with special appearances and special concert. So we're putting a tremendous amount of focus on the opportunity that we see with this millennial customer. Operator : The next question comes from Faye Landes with Cowen and Company. Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : A couple of things. Can you, first of all, you mentioned the impact of FX on gross margin. I'm just trying to figure out what the exact number is. And also, more -- perhaps more crucially, can you define or sort of outline when you expect to return to higher core top line growth rates post the anniversary-ing of China, America leaving [ph], et cetera, and what it's going to take to get there? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So let me start with gross margin. So gross -- foreign exchange had about a 50 basis point approximate impact on gross margin. So if you looked at the gross margin, we talked about the Chaps impact and the FX impact, if you looked at the gross margin excluding those 2 impacts, we would have been flat to slightly up on gross margin on the core business in the quarter. Roger N. Farah: And I think, Faye, in terms of the top line growth, you know all the macroeconomic factors going on in the world today. So I'm not going to rattle those off. Our focus is on a very underdeveloped Asia business for us. We've talked consistently for years about seeing Asia as potentially 1/3 of our business in the future, with Europe being 1/3 and the United States being 1/3. So at 63% U.S, we've got a long way to go in the international markets, whether that's emerging markets like Brazil or other parts of Europe or really the more scalable opportunities in China. So we will continue to look at the distribution strategies, the brand strategies, the marketing strategies that will drive an acceleration in the international growth rates. Within product categories, which is the other focus for us, Jacki touched on several of them. They are the luxury businesses, they are the accessory businesses, and we feel very bullish about the size and opportunity of Polo for Women's, as well as the Denim business. So we have product category opportunities as well as geographic opportunities. And the last leg of that stool is really the ongoing opportunity in e-commerce on a global basis. We're running significant increases in Europe in e-commerce. In our second year, we'll be breakeven or profitable. We are making big investments in Asia, first in Japan, Korea, but after that, China. We think we have a compelling product. We have the brand integrity and the product integrity that allows customers to comfortably buy our products online, with low return rates. So these are very profitable ways to reach customers, particularly in new markets. It's a much more efficient way to talk to customers than trying to build a very big network of retail-only brick-and-mortar stores in these countries. So those are the headlines of growth. We're very committed to them. We've talked about the investments necessary to make. We think we're being prudent about balancing that and delivering ongoing shareholder value. But at this point, those opportunities remain unchanged and unshakable in our mind in terms of where we want to put our management time, energy and our money. Operator : The final question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : Can you talk about the number of -- the points-of-sale that you have in Greater China now versus last year? How many -- could you break out how many concessions you have versus owned retail? Are we likely to see Polo stores increasing in China versus concessions in the future? And then just sort of thoughts on flagships, after these flagships open next spring, is that going to be pretty much it for China? And then you will focus on other stores like the Blue label? Roger N. Farah: Okay, Barbara, let me see if I can summarize, and this will be more directional than absolute specifics. We took back the licensed distribution in China, which was heavily focused on department stores and partners, multiple partners in multiple cities around China. And when we made the decision to shut that down, it wasn't because they weren't doing business or there wasn't an appetite for the product or it wasn't making money. We just thought it did not lay the foundation for the kind of brand we wanted to build long term. So as we've said, about 95 points-of-sale were closed in China over the last 5 quarters. Some of that dribbled in to the first quarter of this year, when Chris talked about discontinued ops, but it wasn't meaningful. So in essence, we shut the network. We have been rebuilding really at this point with standalone stores, mall or street locations. And I think at this point, we have something in the low-teens. But the flagship we just opened in Hong Kong, Men's only, and the flagships we're opening next fall is part of a strategy to have key important flagships in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. We are not at this point looking to go into second or third tier cities in any meaningful way until we establish the full complement of the brand in those flagship locations. Once we've done that and we begin to raise the brand, the visibility and knowledge, which today only 7% of the population really knows us there, which is in stark contrast to our recognition in the United States or Europe, but we'll begin to cascade strategies, distribution points and brands in those markets. We also are looking to overlay that with a thoughtful e-commerce strategy, which will give broader access to the product than we can reach in a reasonable time frame with brick-and-mortar. So with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening. We continue to remain very committed to our long-term growth initiatives and think we've managed the short term as a team very well. Look forward to talking to you in November. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead. James Hurley : Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will comment on our broader strategic initiatives and provide some merchandising highlights from the quarter; Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial perspective on the second quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of fiscal '14. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Since this is the first call Chris and I are hosting in our new roles, let me take this opportunity to talk about the recent change in our organizational structure. As most of you are aware, we've created the Office of the Chairman that includes Ralph Lauren, our Founder, Chairman and CEO; Roger Farah, now our Executive Vice Chairman; myself as President and Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Peterson, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Office of the Chairman is a leadership structure designed to enhance the company's ability to support the growth of our business in an increasingly complex global environment and to allow us to capitalize on new opportunities that will drive the evolution of the company in the coming years. This new leadership team has a remarkable combination of tremendous and highly relevant experience starting, of course, with Ralph's unmatched vision, creativity and excitement about the future, and extending to this team's product and merchandising experience, operational discipline, global perspective and track record of leadership. Roger and I have worked both so closely with Ralph over the past 13 and 9 years, respectively, and Chris brings us all a fresh perspective, as well as his financial acumen and global operational sophistication. This collaborative structure will enable us to translate Ralph's extraordinary vision for the company into focused growth and long-term success. It is important to clarify that this new structure is intended to sharpen and deliver against, rather than change the company's strategic focus. Chris and I have spent much of the last 2 months meeting with our new team and visiting our offices and points of distribution around the world. We've come back from our travels so impressed by the exceptional talent that runs throughout our entire organization. There is no question that we have the right people with the knowledge, experience and passion to help us take this company to the next level. The diversity of the Ralph Lauren portfolio, the strength of our lifestyle positioning and our increasingly global reach are enviable assets that position us for strong long-term growth. As a leadership team, we are very excited about our future. And now shifting gears to the strategy. I'd like to spend some time today reviewing the 3 core pillars of our growth plans, which are building our international presence, extending our direct-to-consumer reach and investing in merchandise innovation. Let me take each of those in turn. First, the expansion of our international presence. We've articulated a goal of having the Americas, Europe and Asia, each represent 1/3 of our revenue. Today, the Americas represents approximately 2/3, Europe accounts for about 20% and Asia is a low double-digit percentage at this point. Over the last 10 years, we've made excellent progress on growing our global reach. International revenues have gained about 1,300 basis points of share in our consolidated revenue mix. The outlook for global growth is equally compelling as we focus on additional market share gains in existing markets and explore high-potential emerging territories, such as Greater China and Central and Eastern Europe. We're developing each market with the optimal mix of retail, wholesale and licensed distribution in order to maximize our opportunities. We'll support our global growth aspirations with world-class merchandising and marketing strategies that have always been both a defining characteristic of the Ralph Lauren brand, and an integral component of the company's success. Our recently created global merchandising organization is off to a strong start already, addressing local market needs across all channels of distribution, while simultaneously driving greater consistency across our assortments worldwide. We expect this consistency to deliver several benefits over the long term, including better leverage on our global sourcing, manufacturing and marketing efforts. Extending our direct-to-consumer reach is our second core strategic pillar. Today, our direct-to-consumer activities encompass a broad range of global retail formats, both physical and digital. Our physical Ralph Lauren, RRL, Denim & Supply, factory and Club Monaco stores, as well as our concession shops and licensed stores in Europe and Asia, showcase our brand messages and product assortment. And of course, we are excited about the launch of our Polo store on Fifth Avenue in the fall of next year, which will offer a beautiful assortment of men's and women's apparel and accessories and a restaurant. We believe that Polo stores are a compelling new way for us to leverage the powerful global appeal of our most iconic brand. On the digital front, e-commerce is another critical component of further extending our direct-to-consumer reach. This has been our fastest-growing distribution channel over the last several years, and we expect the momentum to continue as the consumer continues to respond to the convenience, selection and pre-shopping research capabilities of the online space. Because of the ongoing importance of these online stores, there has been an area of significant investment for us. During the second quarter, we opened a greatly expanded distribution center for our North American e-commerce operations, launched e-commerce in South Korea and are now transacting online in 10 European countries. We've invested over $1 billion in capital in our global retail development over the last 10 years, which has led to strong retail segment operating profit improvement in that same time frame. Looking to the future, we expect a growing portion of our capital will be allocated to our direct-to-consumer efforts, particularly as we see the worldwide appeal of our brand. We are simultaneously investing in the people and processes that will enable us to accelerate this growth over the next several years. The third core pillar is merchandise innovation. As you heard me say before, our products are the hallmark of our brand and the lifeblood of our business, and our ability to consistently deliver innovative products is one of our most powerful competitive advantages. The combination of Ralph's vision and the investment we've made in our world-class design, merchandising, sourcing and production talent is unmatched. The bandwidth of the Ralph Lauren brand and the desirability of our products have fueled strong multi-year growth. Consistent innovation has enabled us to intensify our leadership position in core merchandise categories and establish both excitement and credibility with new brands and product categories, such as Denim & Supply, our handbag business, footwear, watches and fine jewelry. Ralph has always believed in the combination of the finest quality, the most aspirational appeal and the most enduring value. Our women's Collection, men's Purple Label, luxury accessories and Ralph Lauren watches and fine jewelry lines are the purest expression of his vision. The intricacy of design and quality of materials from hand-beaded Collection gowns or a bespoke Purple Label suit to a crocodile Ricky handbag or our tourbillon movement watch, are now appreciated by our customers who recognize the craftsmanship behind these extraordinary luxury products. The magnificent store environments and global advertising, marketing and PR efforts, bring Ralph's spectacular world to life and establish the halo for our entire product portfolio. Our recent Paris fashion show, in support of the company's contribution to the restoration of L'\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts is the most recent example of our world-class brand coming to life in a unique and highly impactful way. And for those of you who may have missed it, I encourage you to visit RalphLauren.com to view the dog walk. The first runway show for dogs that was both an interesting way to showcase our fall Luxury Accessories Collection and a successful philanthropic effort for the ASPCA. This global effort has already drawn a tremendous editorial and social media attention around the world, with close to 140 million impressions today in broadcast, print and online, and over 10 million social media impressions globally. While sell-throughs for our entire product portfolio have been strong across most of our major distribution channels and geographic regions in the first half of the year, performance of our Luxury products was particularly noteworthy during the second quarter. The introduction of new products, such as the Steel Link Stirrup watch, the Safari watch and the soft Ricky Bag, each of which draws inspiration from our extraordinary design vocabulary and are quintessentially Ralph Lauren, have been extremely successful. Accessories will continue to be the main focus of our global merchandising, advertising and marketing efforts over the next several months. This fall, we had an impactful pop-up shop presentation for the soft Ricky in key wholesale locations around the world, from Harrods in London and colette in Paris to Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City. Our upcoming holiday campaign builds upon this momentum with a fully integrated product focus message behind our newest accessories icon that will be consistent across all key consumer touch points. If the women in your life does not already have a soft Ricky, we can't think of a better holiday gift. Our results for the first 6 months of fiscal '14 continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our diversified operating model. In the face of an uneven global operating environment, we plan the business prudently and experience solid results in our largest markets, even as we continue to make significant investment in the infrastructure necessary to support our long-term growth objectives. As many of you know, we have consistently made outsized, near-term investments with an expectation of achieving greater functional and financial leverage down the road, as high-growth channels, regions and merchandise categories evolve into the future. The consistency of this approach has allowed us to deliver strong shareholder returns over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Christopher H. Peterson: Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter sales and profits we're reporting today are in line with the expectations we provided in August, and I'd like to start with a recap of the quarter. Consolidated sales grew 3% in the second quarter, which was at the high end of our expectations. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and unfavorable foreign currency translation, revenues were 4% higher than the prior year period. Growth in the Americas, Europe and most of Asia was partially offset by lower sales in Japan. Global sales trends were uneven during the quarter. July and August were slower as we cycled out of the more promotional spring/summer season, and trends were stronger in September as we transitioned into fall. Footsteps to brick-and-mortar stores remained challenging worldwide, although we continued to experience robust growth on the various online platforms where our product is distributed. Gross profit margin of 56.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 was 220 basis points below the prior year period, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency dynamics, the mix impact from integrating the Chaps men's sportswear business and lower profits from concession shops. Operating expenses of $789 million in the second quarter were 6% greater than the prior year period. The higher operating expenses primarily reflect cost associated with newly transitioned operations and continued investment in the company's strategic growth initiatives. The growth in operating expenses was partially offset by disciplined operational management. Operating expense rate of 41.2% was 110 basis points above the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating income was $295 million and operating margin was 15.4%, 330 basis points below the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating margin was in line with the guidance we provided in August. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 was $205 million, 4% below the $214 million achieved in the comparable period of fiscal 2013, and net income per diluted share declined 3% to $2.23. An effective tax rate of 29% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 includes the benefit of restructuring certain international operations and compares to 38% in the prior year period, which included the net negative impact of a onetime discrete tax item. Moving on to segment level details. Wholesale revenues grew 1% to $928 million in the second quarter, primarily a result of the contribution from the newly transitioned Chaps men's sportswear operations and continued growth in core North American merchandise categories, which continue to gain market share. A planned reduction in shipments to certain European customers, lower Japanese wholesale sales and a shift in the timing of certain wholesale shipments due to SAP implementation, partially mitigated wholesale revenue growth during the quarter. Wholesale operating income of $202 million was 13% below the prior year period due to the foreign exchange dynamics and lower international wholesale sales. Retail segment sales rose 5% to $944 million in the second quarter, reflecting the incremental contribution from new stores, including the recently transitioned Australia/New Zealand operations, and growth for the company's e-commerce operations. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and foreign currency, retail sales increased 8% from the prior year. Consolidated comparable store sales declined 1% on a reported basis and were up 1% in constant currency during the second quarter, on top of challenging multi-year comparisons. Positive comp growth of freestanding stores and e-commerce operations was more than offset by negative comp growth at Japanese concession shops. With the exception of e-commerce, customer traffic trends were soft across most retail formats during the quarter. However, the teams continue to mitigate lower traffic levels with exceptional customer service efforts that have contributed to improved conversion and higher average dollar transactions at most of our retail formats worldwide. Retail operating income of $135 million was 14% below the prior year period, primarily due to investments in the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts, foreign currency effects and lower profitability at concession shops. Licensing revenues of $43 million were 6% below the prior year period due to lower Chaps licensing revenues as a result of the men's sportswear license take-back. Licensing operating income of $35 million was in line with the prior year period. Consolidated inventory of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter compares to $1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting the integration of formerly licensed operations as directly operated businesses, investment to support anticipated sales growth and the accelerated receipt of inventory related to the SAP implementation. We spent approximately $148 million on capital expenditures to support infrastructure investments in new retail stores and shop installations. The company repurchased about 285,000 shares of its common stock during the second quarter at an average cost of approximately $176. $427 million remains available under previously authorized share repurchase programs for future buybacks. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments. Included in our cash balance is $300 million of new bonds that we issued at the end of September. The proceeds from that offering were used to repay the euro bonds that matured in early October, which is why our consolidated cash and investments increased versus the prior year. Our net cash balance of approximately $835 million is essentially the same. Now I'd like to turn to some important developments on our strategic growth initiatives. We made excellent progress on our SAP implementation during the quarter. At the end of September, we successfully completed a major conversion of our systems platform from legacy systems to SAP. This latest wave represented about 1/2 of our North America wholesale business. We successfully converted millions of pieces of data, including materials, purchase orders, sales orders and inventory records with accuracy rates in excess of 99.9%. We went live on the new system in early October and quickly got to full operational capability. We'd like to thank the team for their extraordinary efforts and acknowledge the great partnership of our wholesale customers as we've executed this important project. With a series of successful codeovers [ph] behind us, we are confident in our approach to the conversions and are well on track to realize the benefits of SAP over the next several years. These benefits include more ready access to information, cost leverage through procurement savings and gross margin leverage through global merchandising. We also completed the integration of our Chaps men's sportswear operations during the quarter, and that business is now fully on Ralph Lauren systems and supply chain. The take-back of our Australia/New Zealand operations was also executed seamlessly, and that business is also fully operational on Ralph Lauren systems and supply chain. The successful SAP conversion and smooth integrations of formerly licensed operations were achieved while managing complex day-to-day operations and are great examples of the company's ability to execute with excellence. The foundational work that we've done in the first 6 months of the year is expected to be a critical enabler of our long-term sales and profit growth. We are pleased to be delivering highly resilient profitability in the context of these substantial investments, particularly with the global operating environment characterized by considerable political instability and fragile consumer confidence. As you will recall, fiscal 2014 was planned with increased investments in retail store and e-commerce development worldwide, the transition of certain formerly licensed products in-region to directly controlled operations and upgrades to our management information systems. Now let me turn to our expectations for the balance of the year. Based on the timing of our specific projects, we've characterized fiscal 2014 as a tale of 2 halves, with modest sales growth and outsized investment spending in the first half of the year, transitioning to accelerated revenue and profit growth in the second half of the year. Our year-to-date results have materialized exactly as we expected, and I want to provide some insight into why we are confident in the accelerated growth we anticipate for the back half of the year. There are 3 key drivers supporting our revenue outlook. First, we have good visibility in our wholesale orders for the balance of the year, and we expect them to be significantly stronger in the back half. Second, we anticipate greater contribution from new stores worldwide, including a larger benefit from the transition of our Australia and New Zealand operations to directly owned. Finally, we've seen strong customer reaction to our fall assortments in both our wholesale and retail channels. With that as backdrop, I'd like to review the outlook we provided in this morning's press release. For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect consolidated revenues to increase by 8% to 10% with wholesale segment sales growing faster than retail segment sales. Foreign currency is estimated to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter, and will primarily affect our retail segment given its geographic business mix. Discontinued businesses are estimated to mitigate third quarter sales growth by an additional 100 basis points. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately equal to the prior year's 16.5%, as a lower gross margin is essentially offset by operating expense leverage. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. For the full year fiscal 2014 period, we are raising our revenue expectations to 5% to 7% growth, which is toward the high end of our previous range of 4% to 7%. Our revenue outlook includes an approximate 200 basis point negative impact from foreign currency effects and headwinds from discontinued operations. Adjusting for those factors, we expect to achieve high-single-digit revenue growth for the full fiscal year period. Based on the momentum we are currently experiencing and the growth we have planned for the remainder of the year, we have decided to intensify our investment in our global retail operations in the second half of fiscal 2014. This investment includes incremental spending on store operations and for our omni-channel efforts, in addition to more advertising and marketing spending. As a result, we currently expect our full year fiscal 2014 operating margin to be at the low end of our outlook, which called for a 25 to 75 basis point decline from the prior year's 16.2%, which was a record level for us. As a reminder, the year-over-year contraction in the operating margin outlook primarily reflects the integration of newly assumed operations, accelerated investments in our various our strategic growth initiatives and foreign exchange impacts. Without that pressure, operating income growth would be up low-double digits for the year. The fiscal 2014 tax rate is now estimated at 30%, down from the previous 31%, based on the favorable impact of restructuring certain international operations. We are one of the world's strongest and most admired brands and we are highly profitable and we have a strong balance sheet. The leadership team is excited about the clear and compelling growth trajectory ahead of us. Fiscal 2014 is a year of important investment for the company. We are allocating talent and capital to our most compelling, high-return opportunities and we intend to continue operating the business according to the clearly defined strategies and disciplined execution that are the hallmarks of the organization. Our expectation for accelerated sales momentum in the second half of the year is a testament to the growing desirability of the Ralph Lauren brand across an expanding range of merchandise categories and on an increasingly global platform. Improved sales growth is expected to be matched with even stronger profit expansion as we leverage the investments we are making in the business. We are confident that the strategic decisions and investments we are making will support substantial shareholder value creation over the long term. The board's decision to raise the quarterly cash dividend by 12.5%, demonstrates its conviction in the company's operating strategies and growth prospects. Now we'd like to open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Jacki and Chris, congratulations on your new roles and in your first kind of conference call with your new responsibilities. I'd love to hear your take on the Polo store opportunity. I know it's still early. The flagship on Fifth Avenue doesn't open for a while, but I'd love to hear your vision for what it will look like, what kind of categories, price points, any sub-brands, the kids or RLX, kind of the long-term potential for that business. It seems to me that kind of Blue Label category has been mostly a wholesale business, historically, and the distribution expansion has been limited. And how do you view this opportunity as a way to take that kind of the heart of the brand there and expand it globally, and will there be any impact on your wholesale business? Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Excited to talk about this opportunity. As you know, you're absolutely right. The Polo store opportunity is a core strategy for us going forward. We opened our first Polo store, actually, in East Hampton this summer and met with outstanding results. Followed that, last month with an opening in the Short Hills Mall, the new Polo concept, primarily men's Polo. And in this case, women's Blue Label as over the next year we'll be transitioning to a new defined line called Polo Women's. That line will open in concert with our Fifth Avenue opening next fall, and we're very excited about that. So the categories will be men's and women's apparel. Our price points in women's, as you know our price points in men's, will be very consistent with our men's price points. So aspirational, exciting product but affordable and democratic in its reach and its audience. Our intention is to expand this concept globally and we already have a site planned and located in London, and are very excited about that location, as it is highly visible and heavy traffic. So we're really working hard on the new women's Blue Label line. It will be distributed for retail and wholesale. We're currently in conversations with our wholesale customers over new points of location within their stores, and we have met with a lot of excitement. That line will open over the next couple of months and it might be an opportunity to invite everyone to the showroom to see our new launch of Polo Women's, which we're obviously quite excited about. Christopher H. Peterson: Omar, the only thing I would add is that, certainly, we see the Polo store rollout as a key plank in the company's growth strategy over the next 3 to 5 years. And we're looking very actively at real estate locations in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia to rollout the Polo brand. And I think your observation is correct which is, today, the Polo brand is largely distributed in wholesale, and we think we've got an opportunity to expand the distribution of the Polo brand given the strength of the brand and the desirability of the brand through a direct retail store rollout. Operator : The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : My question is around the incremental investment that you highlighted today. I wondered if you could tell us a little bit more about where you're allocating that spend. Is it more towards Europe and Asia or is it more evenly distributed? And then how should we think about -- I know it's a little early, but how should we think about how this success towards fiscal year '15? Are you bringing any spend forward because of what you announced today and how does that impact spend for next year? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. Well, first of all, with regard to the incremental investment, I would say that the incremental investment is really focused on 3 areas. The first is we're intensifying our investment in store operations. The second is we're focused on investing more money in some of our omni-channel capability that's directed against the retail segment. And the third is some of our marketing and advertising spend, where we're intensifying investment, based on some of the strong results that we've seen to date from the consumer response to a couple of our marketing campaigns, which I'll talk in a minute about -- I'll talk in a minute more about. We believe that this incremental investment is going to result in improved traffic trends and conversion for our retail stores going forward. And that's part of the reason why we're taking our revenue guidance up for the balance of the fiscal year versus our initial outlook. A couple of the examples on the marketing spend, just to give you a flavor, the first is we've -- for the first time, really, across the company, globally, come out with an advertising campaign around the Ricky handbag, the soft Ricky product, and we've coordinated that as a big idea where we've got it holistically supported in every market in the world. We have the product in our stores and we've -- are doing a holistic marketing and advertising campaign that's really hitting the consumer across multiple touch points. And we started to see that really resonate and drive an acceleration in our accessories business. And given the holiday season that's upcoming, we felt like that was a good one to continue to support and spend money behind going forward. The other one that you may have seen is, we have the Olympics that the company sponsors, which is coming up in Sochi in February. And we put a fairly significant effort behind an advertising campaign around Made in America, where the product that we're going to be rolling out for the Olympics will be made in America and we put an intense sort of advertising campaign and PR campaign around that product. So those are a couple of examples of where we're spending the money, and we're expecting to see a good return from the incremental investment that we see. With regard to fiscal '15, well, it's a little bit early for us to provide guidance on fiscal '15, we're just about to kick off our planning process. I suspect we'll have some initial thoughts to share on our next earnings call with regard to fiscal '15, and then we'll provide guidance for fiscal '15 as we always do at our end of fiscal year call. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Two questions. First, Chris, obviously, the noise on gross margins has been significant this year. I know you just said you're not -- we're not looking ahead to fiscal '15 yet. But as we think out about -- as we think past fiscal '14, how should we look at the gross margins? How much of that do you think you could start to recapture and maybe where will it come from? So when did the Chaps margin start to improve and when does the mix shift benefits you guys have start to override the current headwinds? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit more about Europe trends with the 2 businesses, where we're at on wholesale, and is that on track to still return to positive growth by spring? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So on gross margin, I'd say a couple of things. So the first is, if you look at the gross margin in the second quarter, the biggest driver of the gross margin decline in the second quarter was foreign exchange. That accounted for about 1/2 of the gross margin decline in the quarter. The second big driver in gross margin decline was the take-back of the Chaps men's sportswear business which, of course, goes from a license business, which has a very, very high gross margin, to a directly-operated business, which has a lower gross margin. So if you were to strip out those 2 elements, the gross margin this year was actually not down nearly as much as what the reported numbers would be. To your point on where we go going forward, I do think that we believe that gross margin can grow over the next 3 to 5 years versus where we are today, and there's a couple of reasons for that. I think as the business shifts more from a wholesale business to a retail business, that tends to have a positive mix effect on gross margin because, obviously, our gross margins in our retail business are higher than our gross margins in our wholesale business. The second thing I would say is that as our business shifts to stronger growth internationally, that international growth tends to come with higher gross margins because of the price points, particularly in Asia, tend to be higher with higher gross margins than they are in the core U.S. business. And then the third thing I would say is, some of the product categories that we're focused on, particularly the accessories product category, as that business continues to grow faster than the balance of the merchandise categories, can have a positive gross margin mix effect. So I think we're dealing with a couple of isolated events this year. But I think over our planning horizon, over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect some of the broader mix drivers to begin to take hold. And then on Europe, I would say on Europe that -- we were fairly encouraged in the quarter on Europe. And the reason we're fairly encouraged that the quarter on Europe is because about half of our business in Europe is wholesale now and about half of our business is retail. The retail including both our full-priced stores, our e-commerce business and our outlet business. And if you look within the European revenue results, what you would see is that our retail business in Europe in the second quarter was up double digits on revenue. And our wholesale business, we had planned to be down in the quarter, which largely offset the retail growth during the quarter, because we had proactively pulled back on shipments into the wholesale channel as we wanted to reduce our exposure from an inventory standpoint from some of the specialty stores, particularly in Southern Europe. As we look to the back half of the year, we're expecting the wholesale business in Europe, in the back half of the year, to be up versus year ago. So we now think that we have cycled through that planned pullback in shipments into the European wholesale channel. Operator : The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : A question on capital allocation and leverage. You announced a nice increase in the dividend today. It does appear you have excess cash balance and certainly some balance sheet capacity to borrow. You just refinanced one of your issues. And some of the feedback we got from investors is that there's potential to more meaningfully increase the dividend, more meaningfully increase share buybacks. As someone relatively new to the team, is that one of your strategies to be more aggressive in utilizing the balance sheet and returning more cash to shareholders? Christopher H. Peterson: Yes. I would say a couple of things. In fact, we just had discussion on the capital structure with the board earlier this week. But I would say, our strategy on capital is, first and foremost, we want to make sure that we're fully funding investments into the organic growth of the business going forward, and that will always be our sort of top priority. Beyond that, we believe the company is going to generate excess cash that we intend to return to shareholders. And I think that the decision by the board to increase the dividend this quarter is a reflection of that fact that we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. I don't think that we have a strategy of trying to hold excess cash on our balance sheet. And as -- if you look over the past couple of years, we've tended to repurchase anywhere from $400 million to $500 million of stock a year and I think we planned to continue that trend as well. From a debt ratings standpoint, I think we like being about in the single A tolerance area, which is where our current ratings are. And so I would expect our strategy on, from a credit rating standpoint, to be relatively consistent. I wouldn't expect a change in strategy there. And then the final thing I would say that we're managing along with many other companies is not all of the cash on our balance sheet is in the U.S. We have a mix of cash that's in the U.S. and a mix of cash that's outside of the U.S. And obviously, the cash that's outside of the U.S., we believe, is better used investing in growth opportunities outside the U.S. rather than bringing back into the U.S. at this point, given the tax friction that would be created from that. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffrey. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Just a question on Asia. The concession seemed to be still a little bit of a headwind. Can you just contextualize some of the pressure points in the key markets there? Is it more macro, is it more competitive environment changes? And then in particular in Japan, can you just maybe parse out how the Denim & Supply stores versus the Ralph Lauren stores are performing? And then I guess as it relates to the acceleration in growth in Q3, what are your expectations around the Asian markets there? Christopher H. Peterson: Okay. I'll start with Asia. And I guess what I would say on Asia is, if you looked at the Asian revenue results, excluding Japan, the company revenue was up double digits in the second quarter. The Japan business was down significantly, and really there were 2 things that were driving that revenue decline in Japan. The first, as many of you have been following, is the Japanese government has embarked on a macroeconomic strategy of weakening their currency with the attempt to accelerate GDP growth in the region. The currency impact year-over-year in Japan to the company was greater than a 20% drop from a translation standpoint in the sales results in the Japanese market for us. So that was kind of a first impact that hit us in Japan. I think as we talked previously, we have priced to try to recover some of that, but not all of that currency impact. The second big driver that's impacted us in Japan in the second quarter is that the traffic trends in the department stores continue to be challenging, and our business today is heavily weighted in the department stores. So the vast majority of our business in Japan is in the department stores. What we're trying to do there in the market is both reinvigorate our growth in the department stores and try to create a little bit more of a direct-to-consumer model with the launch of e-commerce and with the opening of some of our freestanding stores. You mentioned Denim & Supply, and I think we've got a handful of Denim & Supply stores open now in Japan. It's a little early to tell fully the results because it's still a new brand that we're driving brand awareness, but we're off to an encouraging start in the Denim & Supply stores in Japan. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: We have a couple of new stores that opened. Our store on Cat Street, which is near the Omotesando District. And most recently about a month ago, we opened our Denim & Supply store in Osaka, and that has met with outstanding results. So we're very encouraged in terms of the Japanese consumer, both loving our RRL brand, which is a cornerstone of authenticity and has been wildly successful in that market, and now followed by Denim & Supply, which is we feel we're off to a very good start in that market. Operator : The final question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I just wanted to ask about, earlier in the call when you started the call, you talked about some of your long-term initiatives, which was pretty helpful. I guess, I was wondering if you could maybe, without speaking exclusively to guidance to next year, but just over time over the next several years, talk about how you think about sales and earnings growth? I think in the past you've talked about historic trends in the 10% to 11% range for sales and more like mid-teens for EPS growth. Is that still kind of how you think about this business given all the transitions that are happening kind of over the long term? Christopher H. Peterson: Yes. I guess I would say a couple of things on that. So I think if you look back over the last 10 years, the numbers you're talking about of 10% to 11% revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth is, historically, what the company has delivered over that time period. I think if you look over the last 10 years, part of what's characterized the company's growth has been the take-back of significant license businesses, which have added to the top line. I think the path going forward is going to be a little bit different than the path that the company has come on over that last 10-year period, because the path going forward is going to be more about growth through the strategies that we have articulated, direct-to-consumer, international expansion and product and merchandise category innovation. So I think we haven't provided long-term guidance in terms of what we expect over the next 3 to 5 years. But certainly, we anticipate delivering results going forward that we believe will be very competitive in the industry and we believe will lead to shareholder value creation. James Hurley : Great. Are there any additional questions, operator? Operator : We have no further questions. Christopher H. Peterson: All right. Thank you very much. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead. James Hurley : Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. The agenda for today's call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will comment on our broader strategic initiatives and provide some merchandising highlights from the quarter. Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide operational and financial perspective on the third quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2014. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller. During today's call, we'll be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting exceptional third quarter results that demonstrate an acceleration in revenue and profit growth. You'll recall that we established aggressive sales and profit plans for fall and holiday, and we are proud to have met the high expectations. Our 9% revenue growth and 11% increase in earnings per share were achieved in the face of one of the most challenging holiday seasons in recent memory. Revenue momentum was broad-based, supported by strong trends across every major geographic region and most merchandise categories. Disciplined operational management enables us to deliver robust expense leverage, even as we continued to make substantial investments in our longer-term growth initiatives. We achieved quite a lot in the first 9 months of the year, including the successful transition of our Chaps men's sportswear business from licensed to owned, the integration of the Australia/New Zealand territories, the doubling of ralphlauren.com's North American distribution center and a smooth transition to SAP for several our most critical operations. Our year-to-date results confirm that fiscal 2014 is actualizing as the tale of 2 halves that we outlined at the beginning of the year. In the back half, we are delivering accelerated revenue momentum and we're leveraging our operational -- operating expenses while continuing to invest in the future. Our financial performance not only demonstrates the operational excellence of our global team, but also confirms the tremendous scope and breadth of the World of Ralph Lauren. We continue to be uniquely capable of servicing both the discerning luxury customer and the quality seeking aspirational customer. The continued growth of our men's, women's and children's assortments, reflects Ralph's ability to consistently deliver fresh interpretations of his iconic design sensibility. Women's was particularly strong in the quarter, with momentum across sportswear, dresses, footwear and the handbag categories, and we also achieved outstanding growth for Purple Label and men's and women's Black Label. Growing our global presence is an important area of strategic focus, so I'd like to spend some time on our performance by region. Beginning with the Americas, which account for over 2/3 of our revenue and where sales accelerated to double-digit growth from mid- to high-single increase in the first half, supported by strong trends in both wholesale and retail segments. This growth is particularly noteworthy, given the decline in store traffic and highly promotional environment of the holiday season. The diversity of our operating model, which is a carefully constructed mosaic of customized product assortments for each distribution channel, enabled us to capture share. Given the scale of the Americas, this growth is clear proof that our winning combination of terrific product, thoughtful planning and merchandising, and powerful brand presentation leads to sustained market share gains. European revenues increased at a high-single-digit rate in constant currency in the third quarter, fueled by the strength of our retail business. Our European wholesale operations reached an important inflection point in shipment trends for 2014 spring/summer season, following several quarters of strategic reductions and wholesale shipments to Southern Europe, we are now returning to growth. Before the financial crisis, Europe was a substantial driver of the company's sales and profit growth. We are pleased the region's economic climate has stabilized to a point where we feel more confident about returning to our pre-recession trajectory. At 20% of our consolidated revenues, Europe remains a significant area of opportunity for the company in wholesale and retail channels throughout the region. Sales in Asia also gained momentum in the quarter, growing at a double-digit rate, supported by the contribution from our newly integrated Australia and New Zealand operations, improved trends in Japan and accelerated growth in Greater China. As many of you know, Asia is an area of substantial opportunity for our company. Today, it represents just over 10% of our total sales, with Japan and Korea accounting for 70% of the region's total. Our focus in Japan and Korea is on reinvigorating the performance of department store concession shops. We have made good progress in the last few months by implementing read-and-react merchandising strategies and customer engagement initiatives. In Greater China, our focus is on elevating the brand's image by expanding our points of distribution. Over the last 2 years, we've tested a variety of comps in the region and we've gained valuable customer insight and feedback. The investment we've made in the new distribution has increased our brand awareness among Chinese consumers, both in the region and throughout the world, and we've begun to see a greater number of Chinese tourists visiting our stores in the U.S. and Europe. Next fall, we will establish our first dual-gender flagship presence in Greater China with a 20,000 square foot Ralph Lauren store in Hong Kong's prestigious Lee Gardens' shopping district. As flagship stores offer the most elevated and comprehensive representation of the World of Ralph Lauren, this opening will mark a significant milestone for us in the region. Based on the improved awareness we've established for the Ralph Lauren brand, in fiscal 2015, we will begin a multiyear plan to open Polo stores throughout Greater China. This is an important evolution in our approach to the market as we expect Polo stores to become a powerful catalyst for our anticipated growth in Greater China. The Polo stores' strategy represents a tremendous global opportunity for the company. We are already securing several locations around the world for this exciting new concept. You've heard me speak about the Fifth Avenue flagship store we'll open in New York City this fall. And today, I'm excited to tell you we've secured a 20,000-square foot space on Regent Street in London. In addition to New York and London, we expect to open several other locations in the U.S., Europe and Asia over the next couple of years. Our decision to accelerate the rollout of these Polo stores coincides with several important product initiatives. First and foremost is the debut of women's Polo this fall, which marks a major milestone in the brand's history. We are also excited to unveil a fantastic assortment of men's polo suits, suit separates, sport jackets and trousers this fall, as a result of taking the men's clothing license in-house. The line features the more refined, dressier aspect of the Polo brand's DNA and fill the white space in both the consumers' wardrobe and our offering. E-commerce is another very important area of focus for our company. The holiday season sales data clearly validates the customers growing comfort level with the channel. In the third quarter, our global e-commerce operations achieved high-teens comp growth, with our North American operations being the most significant contributor to that increase. Our newer Ralph Lauren international e-commerce and Club Monaco businesses are expanding even faster. Our international e-commerce revenues have grown more than 50% this year, with excellent trends in both Europe and Japan and clubmonaco.com is up over 70%. In the wholesale online space, where we have focused quite a lot of our attention, our performance has also been exceptional. Given the rise of both browsing and buying with mobile devices, we are enhancing our capabilities in that area, while also continuing to strengthen the customer experience online. The importance of our consistent investment in world-class advertising, marketing and public relations is undeniable, particularly in the current environment. Consumers clearly recognize that the Ralph Lauren brand signifies style, quality and enduring value and our communication strategies provide immediate call to action that generate sales. While we support our entire portfolio with the appropriate messages, I'd like to highlight 3 of our current campaigns. First is the star of our Ralph Lauren accessories line, the Ricky handbag. On our last call, I shared the momentum we were seeing from the global campaign for our Soft Ricky handbag. This is an effort that was executed consistently across all key customer touch points and that was supported by the complete alignment of our production, merchandising, visual presentation and sales teams. I'm pleased to report that the ongoing results have been tremendous and have, in fact, exceeded our expectations. The Soft Ricky has been extremely well received in our own Ralph Lauren stores, as well as our select specialty store partners around the world. As we hoped it would, the Soft Ricky has generated awareness and interest in our complete Ricky line, and has proven our credibility in the luxury accessories arena. This strategy continues into spring season, which 3 exciting new styles will be introduced : A mini version of the original Ricky, a two-tone Soft Ricky in 8 color combinations and a new Ricky model with a chain detail on the strap. For the luxury accessories consumer, who is always in the market for something new, these 3 new styles are sure to catch her eye. Next, the Olympics. In the coming weeks, our brands will enjoy extraordinary global visibility at the Winter Games in Sochi, where we are the proud sponsors of team U.S.A. for the fourth time. We wish our athletes the very best, and we thank everyone at Ralph Lauren whose hard work and dedication allows us to support their efforts and represent our country so beautifully. And finally, our sponsorship of Downton Abbey, which provides us with a perfect environment to bring our Ralph Lauren luxury brand message to the right television audience. While year-to-date, our performance reflects the consistent operational excellence of our teams, it is also the result of many years of careful planning, strategic decisions and wise investments that at times may have had a negative short-term impact, but ultimately made us a stronger and more profitable organization. We are confident that the investments we are making today in our growth initiatives, infrastructure and communications will continue to support top line momentum and create shareholder value for the long term. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Christopher H. Peterson: Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in this morning's press release, our third quarter performance reflects accelerated top line momentum and resilient operating profitability that were in line with the high end of our expectations. We are proud of these results, especially in the context of a shorter and highly promotional holiday environment. Consolidated net revenues in the third quarter were $2 billion, a 9% increase from the prior year period, with strong growth for both our wholesale and retail segments. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and unfavorable foreign currency translation, revenues were up 11%. Revenue growth was broad-based, with the Americas, Europe and Asia all growing revenues by high-single digits or better in constant currency terms. Gross profit margin of 58.2% was 110 basis points lower than the prior year period, as unfavorable foreign currency dynamics and the mix impact from integrating the Chaps menswear operations more than offset improved profitability in our core business. Operating expense rate of 41.6% was 120 basis points below the prior year, as disciplined operational management provided strong expense leverage on accelerated revenue growth. Operating income was $334 million and operating margin was 16.6%, 10 basis points higher than the prior year, which was at the high end of our expectations. Net income for the third quarter was $237 million or 10% higher than the $216 million achieved in the comparable prior year period, and net income per diluted share increased 11% to $2.57. An effective tax rate of 27% in the third quarter was in line with the prior year period. The lower-than-expected tax rate reflects the favorable resolution of a discrete onetime item during the quarter. Moving on to segment level details. Wholesale revenues rose an impressive 14% to $840 million, driven by the strong momentum in our core North American merchandise categories, where we continue to gain market share, the addition of Chaps menswear operations and improved trends in Europe as we've annualized the rebasing of the business in Southern Europe. Wholesale operating income of $168 million was 16% above the prior year period, and wholesale operating margin increased to 20 basis points to 19.9%. The improvement in the wholesale segment margin was due to stronger profitability in core operations that was partially offset by the mix impact from the integration of the Chaps menswear operations and negative foreign currency effects. Our retail segment sales rose 6% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the incremental contribution from new stores, including the recently transitioned Australia/New Zealand operations and comparable store sales growth. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses and negative foreign currency effects, retail sales increased 10%. Consolidated comparable store sales rose 1% on a reported basis and were up 2% in constant currency during the third quarter on top of challenging multi-year comparisons. Comp growth was primarily driven by strong global e-commerce performance. We experienced lower traffic to many of our brick-and-mortar formats during the quarter, but the teams mitigated this pressure with exceptional customer service that drove improved conversion and higher units per transaction at most of our retail concepts worldwide. Retail operating income of $223 million was 11% higher than the prior year period, and retail operating margin improved 90 basis points to 19.8%. The improvement in retail segment profitability reflects the extraordinary operational discipline of our global teams and was achieved despite increased investments in new store rollouts and e-commerce expansion efforts. Licensing revenues of $45 million were 12% below the prior year period as higher licensing revenues for Ralph Lauren products were more than offset by lower Chaps and Australia/New Zealand licensing revenues as a result of recent license take-backs. Licensing operating income of $34 million was 8% below the prior year period. Consolidated inventory of $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter compares to $981 million in the prior year period, reflecting the integration of formerly licensed operations to directly controlled businesses and investment to support anticipated sales growth, including inventory for new stores and e-commerce operations. We spent approximately $81 million on capital expenditures compared to $78 million in the prior year period, primarily to support our global retail development initiatives and infrastructure investments. The company repurchased about 1.1 million shares of its common stock in the quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchase activity to 2.3 million shares or about $400 million. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments and our net cash balance was approximately $1.1 billion, both of which were in line with the prior year's levels. So a fantastic quarter by any standard and even more so when we consider the challenges of the shorter and highly promotional holiday environment. At this point, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate and increase by 10% to 12%, with wholesale growing faster than retail. Foreign exchange and discontinued operations are estimated to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, with most of that headwind affecting the retail segment. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to improve 50 to 90 basis points from the 11.1% achieved in the prior year period, as a lower gross margin is more than offset by operating expense leverage even as we continue to make significant investments in the company's strategic growth objectives. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 30%. For the full year fiscal 2014 period, we are raising our revenue growth guidance to 7%, which is at the high end of our previous range of 5% to 7%, due to stronger-than-anticipated wholesale momentum. Our revenue guidance includes an approximate 150 to 200 basis point negative impact from foreign currency effects and discontinued operations. Our new outlook calls for the full year fiscal 2014 operating margin to be 110 to 120 basis points below the prior year's record level of 16.2% and compares to our prior expectation of a 75 basis point decline. The change in operating margin guidance is driven by 3 factors : The channel mix impact from stronger wholesale revenue growth; the higher-than-anticipated restructuring and other charges; and incremental pressure as a result of the intensified promotional tenor of the U.S. retail landscape in the post-holiday period. While we experienced strong sales and gross margin trends on our core business in the third quarter, we believe that being proactively competitive with the overall marketplace will position us well for the start of the spring selling season. As a reminder, the primary drivers of the year-over-year contraction in operating margin are the successful integration of newly assumed operations, accelerated investments in our strategic growth initiatives and foreign exchange impacts. The fiscal 2014 tax rate is now estimated at 29% compared to our prior expectation of 30%. The net impact of our updated 2014 outlook keeps us in the range of our prior expectations, although we get there in a slightly different manner with stronger revenue growth, a slightly lower operating margin and a more favorable tax rate. We remain committed to investing in the growth initiatives that have supported the company's strong financial results over the last several years, and that provide us with a more robust platform for future sales and profit growth. While we are still in the process of refining our fiscal 2015 budget, I did want to provide some qualitative insight into how we are approaching the next fiscal year. On the top line, we expect significant contributions from a number of the growth initiatives we've invested in this year, such as the Polo and Ralph Lauren flagship stores Jacki spoke about earlier, global e-commerce expansion and new product development. Specifically, we expect the continuation of our strong momentum and our planning for revenues to increase at a high-single-digit rate. Fiscal 2015's consolidated revenue growth is expected to be retail-led with international markets and e-commerce providing outsized contributions to growth. There are several areas of incremental investment in fiscal 2015 that are expected to become important contributors to our growth over the next 3- to 5-year period. These include the global expansion of the Polo brand, continued investment in our luxury business and sustained investment in IT infrastructure. With respect to the global expansion of the Polo brand, we'll be investing on several fronts. First and foremost, we plan to accelerate our global store development for Polo. In addition to the Fifth Avenue flagship and Regent Street flagship locations, we'll be actively looking for locations throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia, including China, where we think the time is right for us to reenter the market with Polo product. We're also investing in broadening the Polo product portfolio, including the launch of women's Polo and the introduction of a men's tailored clothing line that we are now directly operating. As with other product launches and license take-backs, these will require incremental resources for design, merchandising, production and sales. We'll also support the Polo expansion strategy with increased global advertising and marketing to build awareness for the new stores and merchandise categories. For our luxury business, we're increasing our advertising, marketing and PR activity to support the opening of our Lee Gardens flagship store in China and also to drive the growth of accessories based on the success we have had with our Soft Ricky campaign. We will also be investing in the product by using finer materials and higher-quality manufacturing resources. While this will result in a higher cost of goods, it will allow us to offer even more compelling value to the consumer and to support strong global momentum we are experiencing with our luxury merchandise. Regarding IT infrastructure, we will begin the next phase of SAP implementation, which is focused on our European operations. We'll be starting this phase as we are simultaneously completing the successful implementation of our North America wholesale and global supply chain operations. Over time, we believe SAP should enable appreciable productivity improvements and procurement savings. We also plan to start a multiyear project to upgrade our core e-commerce technology platform globally. Our e-commerce revenues have grown at a 25% compound annual rate over the last decade, and we expect e-commerce to remain one of our fastest-growing businesses. This fiscal year, we invested $75 million in capital in ralphlauren.com's North Carolina-based customer fulfillment center, doubling the facility in order to support a doubling of the business from current levels. The global platform upgrade we are beginning in fiscal 2015 will require a substantial investment in both capital and operating expense. We were pioneers in selling luxury products online and have made tremendous progress in the last decade. As we build the new platform out, it will allow us to improve our omni-channel capabilities and significantly enhance our online and mobile shopping experience, ensuring that ralphlauren.com remains a world-class destination for our customers. We believe a more sophisticated technological backbone is a necessary enabler of sustained revenue growth, allowing e-commerce to become a more important part of our business. The investments we're making in Polo, luxury and e-commerce are consistent with our strategy to distort resources to high-growth, high-margin opportunities. While each of these areas of investment is expected to generate returns that greatly exceed our cost of capital, the near-term impact on operating expenses means that the fiscal 2015 operating margin will likely be below 2014's level. We'll be completing the fiscal '15 planning process over the next few months and we will provide a more detailed outlook for next year when we report our fourth quarter earnings in May. We are confident that we are making the right investments to expand the Ralph Lauren brand in a manner that maximizes our global sales and profit potential over the intermediate and long term. We have consistently made outside investments in the near term with an expectation that we would achieve strong returns as high-growth merchandising categories, channels and regions evolve in the future. You can see those returns playing out in the second half of fiscal 2014, which gives us the confidence to proceed with the next wave of important investments. Our Board of Directors shares our conviction, which is evidenced by the additional $500 million share repurchase authorization we announced today, bringing our total authorizations to $730 million. And with that, I'll conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask a little bit about this kind of mix. It sounds like your wholesale is accelerating, but retail has been such a big driver. Chris, your initial comments for next year sounded like retail is going to continue to be a big driver. But maybe there's some margin pressure because of the wholesale growth and it's obviously, at least, at the gross margin level. I think you made a comment about proactively -- being proactively competitive. Just help me put all this into context of what it means for margins looking out? Christopher H. Peterson: Yes. So I think in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, we're expecting operating margin to be up 50 to 90 basis points, and that brings our fiscal '14 full year margin, operating margin, a little bit lower than our previous guidance. And really there's 3 factors impacting that. One is the revenue being stronger in wholesale than what we had anticipated previously, which does put a little bit of mix pressure because the wholesale business operates at a lower gross margin rate than the retail business. The second is we're going to incur a little bit higher restructuring charges than what we had originally anticipated. And then the third is although we had a very strong third quarter result in our core business, so if you looked at our gross margin in the third quarter, excluding the impact of -- the mix impact from Chaps and foreign exchange, our core business gross margin globally was actually up 50 basis points versus a year ago in the third quarter. We're just being a little bit cautious with regard to the environment we're operating, because what we're seeing from a competitive dynamic standpoint is an intensified promotional environment. And we want to make sure that in the fourth quarter, we work through our inventory plans so that we can convert in a strong fashion into the spring selling season. So that's really what's happening with regard to sort of margin dynamics this year. With regard to next year, I think we're still early in our planning phase for next year. And I would expect that next year, we'll see gross margin higher next year than we are this year. But because of the significant investments that we're making in future growth initiatives, at this point, we think it's likely that operating margin will be down next year versus this year, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. Operator : The next question is from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I was wondering if you could help us reconcile the rollout of Polo stores in China. It seems like most recently, the focus has been on the luxury end of Ralph Lauren in China, and now it seems there's a sooner-than-expected rollout of Polo stores in China. So can you help us understand what's changed there? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. Let me start on that. So that's right. I think as we've taken the license back from the licensee that we had previously, several years ago, and we've rebased the distribution in China with closing 95 points of distribution and sort of resetting the brand image with opening our luxury store portfolio, we've been very closely monitoring the consumer reaction, both from an awareness standpoint and from a perception of the brand standpoint, not just in China through our store performance, but also outside of China as consumers are -- Chinese consumers are shopping when they travel. And so one of the things that we've been focused on is how is the Chinese consumer responding in our European business and in our U.S. business. And at least in the most recent periods, we've seen as a result of this resetting of the brand image in China, that, in the most recent period, for example, in Europe the Chinese consumer in Europe business is actually up 50% versus year ago. So we're starting to see the impact that we wanted to see from a consumer perception translate into increases outside of China when the Chinese customer travels. In the U.S., the Chinese consumer is now in the top 5 of our foreign customers that are buying in our stores as we're tracking that. And because of that, and because of the opening of the Lee Gardens flagship store that we have this fall, we think the time is now right where we've appropriately reset the brand image to begin to rollout Polo stores in that marketplace. And so that has been an active dialogue inside the company and is a decision that we've just made. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: And since -- let me add to Chris' comments, we are seeing that over 55% of the consumers that are Chinese consumers are actually shopping outside of China. So many of the important statements that we've made throughout the rest of the world, whether that's in Europe or in the U.S., we're starting to really see an acceleration of that customer. What we're also seeing is an important difference in the unit transaction with the Chinese consumer versus our more standard consumer that, that transaction is actually double the size of our standard transaction. So we're seeing that also as quite a meaningful opportunity for us. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a couple of questions for you. Could we hear a little bit more about the change in trajectory? It sounds like you saw in Japan, in the quarter, I mean, obviously, the FX exacerbated an already challenging market there over the past few quarters, but maybe we could hear about a little bit more about what caused an inflection and if those concessions were actually positive and sustainable there. And then if I could ask one other question, it will be about the Polo women's opportunity that you talked about. Maybe if we can just hear a little bit more about that as an opportunity and how big you think that is and perhaps, how you see the distribution going for that. Is that a wholesale opportunity as we get through calendar '14 after you open the store later this year? Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Okay. I'll start with Japan and Asia, and then Jacki can comment on the Polo store, women's Polo plans. So in Asia, you're right, we did see an acceleration of our growth rate in Asia, specifically, and in Japan in particular. So if you look in Asia, our business was up, our revenues were up double digits in constant currency versus year ago in Asia, broadly defined. And in Japan, we went from a period where, on a constant currency basis, our sales were challenged to a period where our sales in Japan were up low-single digits on a constant currency basis. I think part of what\u2019s happened in the Japan market is, with the significant devaluation in the Japanese yen, we decided to take pricing back in May because we thought that it was the right thing for us to do as market leaders, to try to price to recover the cost impact of the yen devaluation. It takes some time for competitors to see what we've done and then to decide, whether they want to or not, adjust their pricing in the market. We think we're at a better place now having adjusted our pricing and having seen some of the competitors adjust their pricing. And so we're now at a point where that price gap that we established when we first took pricing is narrowing and is allowing us to return to a more normalized growth rate for that market. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: In addition to Chris' comments, we've put a task force in place around our Japanese opportunity. And we have solicited help from our very strong sales and merchandising teams kind of around the world to really build some of the very dynamic things that we've done in other parts of the world to help us really transition that business into what we believe is a wonderful opportunity. So whether it's the content or merchandising or store presentation, we've really worked hard to step up our game and we're starting to really see some nice results from that. In addition, on your comment about Polo women, we are actually doing a brand launch, both in retail and wholesale simultaneously. So our store will open in the fall season. And simultaneous to that, we will begin to ship Polo women in about 150 U.S. doors and then significant number of doors in Europe and in Asia, all simultaneous with this very unique launch. We previewed with many, many, many customers from all over the world, actually late December into early January, met with some very positive response to the line. And so that launch will be simultaneous in both retail and wholesale. We also intend to put an important marketing and advertising and PR strategy around that launch, around the world, doing something more similar to what we did when we launched our Soft Ricky. And so we will have a unified message around the world, around the Polo brand in general, and both Polo men's and women's. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffrey. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : I just had a question on Europe. I mean, very encouraging that you see some of that strength return to that market. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on some of the regional nuances during the quarter and just how the local versus the tourist customer responded? And then secondly, if we think about the fiscal '15 top line guidance in the high-single-digit range, maybe could you just help us prioritize the rank of the potential sales growth rates from the key regions, so between Asia, Europe and North America. Christopher H. Peterson: Okay. So I'll start with Europe. So in Europe, about half of our business is wholesale and about half of our business in retail -- is retail. And what has been sort of happening in Europe over the last 18 months as we made this decision, as we talked about 12 or 18 months ago, to proactively pull back on shipments in the wholesale channel in Southern Europe, particularly to the specialty wholesale customer which was, in our view, more at risk from a credit macroeconomic standpoint. During that period, we continue to see strong growth in our retail segment, but the decline in the wholesale business from the pullback proactively in shipments sort of mitigated that trend of European revenue growth over the last several quarters. In the third quarter that we've just reported, we've now annualized that. And so if you look at the wholesale business in Europe, we actually were up low-single digits in wholesale across the European region, and we were up double digits in the retail segment. And the combination of those businesses resulted in Europe on a constant currency basis being up high-single digits as the strength in the retail business is now coming through. So that's a little bit about what's been going on in Europe. If you continue to look at, geographically, at the strength of the business and the strength of the consumer holistically, I think we continue to be in a period where Northern Europe continues to be stronger than Southern Europe. But our view is that Southern Europe has stabilized now, so it's not in as tough a situation compared to year ago, as what we are facing 12 to 18 months ago. But certainly, the Northern European business continues to be stronger than the Southern European business. The other thing that we're excited about in Europe is that when you look out on the wholesale business at future bookings, the future bookings are stronger and auger for continued growth in the wholesale business going forward. I think the fiscal '15 in terms of the high-single-digit range was the other part of the question. So I think it's a little bit premature to talk about the specifics between Europe, Asia and North America. Certainly, we expect Asia to represent disproportionate growth, as a region, as we've opened some of our new stores that we've had in the pipelines like Lee Gardens and continue the momentum in that business. We continue to expect to grow market share with the plans that we have in place in the U.S. marketplace. And I think -- we think Europe is going to be strong because we think we're starting from a base now where we no longer have to sort of rebase the business. But we'll provide more specifics on the next call. Operator : The next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie. Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research : I'm interested in whether or not you see any potential for channel conflict as you rollout these Polo stores. As well as, longer term, what percentage of retail do you think will be achieved in the mix and what kind of store growth are you targeting? Christopher H. Peterson: I think we don't see a significant channel conflict risk in the Polo store rollout strategy. And part of the reason for that is, I think, where you'll see us go with the Polo stores is we believe we'll have the flagship store on Fifth Avenue, which really sets the tone and the aesthetic of the brand globally, which we think will strengthen the Polo brand. But when you look at a lot of the other Polo stores that we're going to be looking at, they're going to really be focused on areas that are more whitespace to us. So if you think about China or if you think about parts of Europe or parts of the Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, really, a lot of the locations that we're going to be going into are locations and geographies where there isn't a strong Polo distribution to begin with. And so it's not so much a conflict as it is an opportunity to fill out whitespace, I think, going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I was wondering if you could provide some color on the performance of your e-commerce business in the quarter? And how should we be thinking about the return on those incremental investments? It would really be helpful for me if you could talk about that e-commerce penetration you've gotten where the targets are longer term. Christopher H. Peterson: E-commerce in the quarter grew high-teens, which we feel very good about. It continues to be a channel where consumers are choosing to shop. I think the convenience of e-commerce and the brand experience that we have on our e-commerce site are really resonating with consumers. We believe that trend is likely going to continue. And so we're planning for e-commerce to continue to be a disproportionate driver of growth. It is a high-profit business in the U.S., where we have scale. So in the U.S., our e-commerce business is about 10% of our overall U.S. business today from a penetration standpoint. And the operating margin of the e-commerce business in the U.S. is at or above the balance of the U.S. business. And so we feel very good about where we are there. In Europe, we're at an earlier stage, so we're not yet as penetrated in e-commerce in the European business because we didn't start as early as we did in the U.S. This year, we're expecting the e-commerce business in Europe to turn profitable, but we still aren't yet at going operating margins because we are not yet at full scale. And in Asia, where we have just started e-commerce with really just a launch just in 2 countries, Japan and Korea, we're off to a strong start. But we're still in investment mode in those markets because we haven't yet reached scale. The other thing that may be worth talking a little bit about is we have a technology platform that underpins our e-commerce operation that the company put in about 8 or 10 years ago. And that technology platform has served the company very well. But as the e-commerce channel and shopping experience continues to involve, we believe there's an opportunity to upgrade that e-commerce technology platform to better service the consumer, improve the shopping experience. And so that's a multiyear project that we're going to be starting shortly here, that we'll talk more about over the upcoming calls. Operator : The next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Could you talk about Denim & Supply performance U.S. and overall? Also can you comment on Club Monaco and what's going on there? Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Yes. Our Denim & Supply performance has been very strong, both internationally in Europe and Asia, and in the U.S. as well. We're rolling out both wholesale and retail points of distribution for the brand. And we're very encouraged as we continue to be a top performer in this space. It's a new business and there's an interesting learning curve. But the Denim penetration, which was something that we were very focused on has -- it's been quite impressive. And I think what we do in the tops and sweater area and outerwear area of the business are quite unique to this space. So we've really had a great acceleration in this brand that we expect to see continue. In Club Monaco, our businesses have been quite good. And we just, as you know, opened a new store in Fifth Avenue, which has been very exciting and a top performer in the company. And then a week ago, we opened our new store in SoHo, which is also off to a very, very strong start. So with the strength in the U.S., strong Asia business and a growing Europe Denim & Supply business -- I'm sorry, Club Monaco business, we're very, very excited. The business in Asia is a license business and we're over 100 stores in Club Monaco today. And we have similar plans for Europe, while we're in early and beginning stages as an owned and operated business in Europe. Operator : The final question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Jacki, can I get you to talk a little more about the Polo women's business? And how that will be positioned globally relative to -- well, I guess, in the U.S., relative to the Lauren business? You were talking about Denim & Supply maybe relative to the Denim & Supply growth on the women's side. And just help us understand how these different women's apparel, wholesale businesses you're doing will be differentiated globally. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Absolutely. Let me start with our Lauren brand, which is foundational today and the backbone of the department stores better business, and has had quite a strong year. And we're very pleased with where Lauren is and where it's positioned. While Lauren serves a broad customer, the foundation of that business is a customer who is essentially in the 35-plus area and who really looks for our brand and our style to supply her broad wardrobe, whether it's her daywear, her evening wear with a great success in our dress business. But again, very broad-based and it tends to be sort of the backbone customer in the department store. In Denim & Supply, it's a new space that's defined under the millennial umbrella. And in that space, as I said, we've really accelerated with our strengths. And in most cases, in that competitive space we're, now, kind of in a #1, 2 or 3 position. In our new Polo women's business, we tend to really see our competition there as a Burberry, as a Tory Burch in that of more contemporary sensibility. And while the line is defined through the iconic Ralph Lauren perspective, it is really appealing to what we see as a younger customer. It has a slimmer fit and the expression of the brand is very eclectic in the way we mix our pieces together and make it very fresh looking, and we think something unique in the marketplace. James Hurley : Great. Thanks very much. Christopher H. Peterson: Thank you, all, very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead. James Hurley : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal \u201814 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning\u2019s call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will give you an overview of the year and comment on our broader strategic initiatives. Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial perspective on the fourth quarter, in addition to reviewing our initial expectations for fiscal \u201815. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jacki. Jacki Nemerov : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014 results today. Our 14% revenue growth and 23% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter were result of double-digit top line expansion in each of our major geographic regions, with Europe and Asia leading the pace in addition to strong profit flow-through for core operations. The results reflect an acceleration from the third quarter\u2019s strong growth rate despite a challenging retail environment, particularly in the United States. Our full year sales growth of 7% and earnings per share of $8.43 represents record levels for us and were achieved even with substantial investments in our growth initiatives and infrastructure, and in the phase of unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds through the quarter. When we provided our fiscal 2014 outlook a year ago, we characterized it as a tale of two halves. We spoke about our spending margin being down in the first half impacted by more modest sales growth and upfront expenses related to the integration of formally licensed operations and pre-opening costs for new stores. And we spoke about our second half in terms of an acceleration in revenue trends and improved profitability, as a result of realizing the benefits of those newly integrated businesses and the store openings. The year played out as we anticipated, in fact a bit better than expected in the second half, which clearly demonstrates the discipline of our organization, to both, manage the business in real-time and plan for the future. Fiscal 2014 was also a year of important progress on each of the company\u2019s long-term growth objectives of extending our direct-to-consumer reach, expanding our international presence, innovation with new products and investing in our infrastructure. Our achievements included the creation of Polo for women, the seamless transition of our Chaps men\u2019s sportswear business from licensed to owned, the integration of the Australia/New Zealand territories into our organization and a doubling of the size of ralphlauren.com\u2019s North American distribution center and a smooth transition to SAP for many of our most critical operations. We also established a new leadership structure designed to enhance our progress on our long-term growth objectives. We opened 46 stores during the year, which was an acceleration from the prior year and consistent with our focus on extending our direct-to-consumer reach. We also established greater clarity around our retail growth objectives with Polo stores being an exciting new evolution in our direct-to-consumer efforts and a compelling complement to our Ralph Lauren luxury stores. Our global e-commerce operations experienced another year of strong double-digit expansion. We expect this to continue to be one of our fastest growing channels over the next several years, bolstered not only by consumer confidence in buying online, but also by new leadership of our e-commerce team and a site re-platform that will enhance functionality and allow us to provide an even stronger brand and customer experience. Turning now to our product. Both luxury apparel and accessories experienced significant growth during the year. Our men\u2019s Purple Label and Black Label lines were more fully developed through additional sportswear and Denim elements respectively to provide more breadth to the product offering and more depth to their lifestyle expressions. Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Black Label performance was particularly strong as we see customers around the world connecting with this brand\u2019s modern streamlined sensibility. We also saw a continued momentum in outerwear and handbags, with consumers responding positively to the distinctiveness of our aesthetic in these areas. Dresses were important driver of growth in women\u2019s wear during the year. We began a more concerted focus on dresses about five years ago to both capitalize on an emerging trend and to express our brand voice in a category that was becoming increasingly important to the consumer. In a short period of time, through a combination of design trend, fit expertise and excellent value proposition and of course the stronger feel of our brand, we\u2019ve established ourselves as a dominant force in the dress category with market leadership across nearly all of our wholesale distributions. Club Monaco also had a fantastic year building on strong multiyear trends. The momentum has been equally strong at Club Monaco\u2019s 57 directly owned North American stores, e-commerce operations and in international markets with the brand that is present in over 120 points of distributions, mostly concentrated in Asia. Club Monaco occupies a unique niche in the market offering the contemporary customer distinctive, on-trend merchandize at a great price. While women\u2019s has been a consistently strong performer over the years, the men\u2019s business have made great progress, thanks to the clarity of design direction in aesthetic which is coming through in both the product and the shopping environment. We supported Club Monaco\u2019s development by investing in growing and renovating the store base, most notably with the brand\u2019s spectacular new flagship in New York. Based on the success we\u2019ve already seen, we intend to accelerate store development for Club Monaco in fiscal 2015. As we look to the future, I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on three key initiatives that we believe will become meaningful drivers of sales and profit growth over the next three to five years. The first initiative is what I\u2019ll call the intensified development of the Polo brand. Polo achieved significant milestone in fiscal 2014 with the creation of Polo for women. We are very excited about the long-term potential for women\u2019s Polo, especially given the broad global success of our men\u2019s Polo product. Today, the split between our men\u2019s and women\u2019s mix is about 60/40. The overall marketplace is in the reverse, and we believe the introduction of women\u2019s Polo is an opportunity for us to increase the penetration of our women\u2019s business. Women\u2019s Polo will replace our existing women\u2019s Blue Label line, so the launch is not entirely incremental for us in the near-term. Over the long-term however, we believe the breadth and scope of the lines aesthetic, fitting price points will address a much broader market than we did with Blue Label. We are also taking back our men\u2019s clothing license and will be launching an expanded line of Polo tailored clothing this Fall. This more comprehensive assortment of suits, sports clothes and trousers will allow Polo to establish its strong foothold in these essential aspects of a man\u2019s wardrobe. Tailored clothing has always been an integral part of the Ralph Lauren DNA and is the perfect complement to Polo\u2019s leadership in sportswear. We are also in the early stages of executing our plan to open Polo stores worldwide. We believe these stores will be a wonderful counterpart to our valued North America and European wholesale distribution. Polo stores will likely become the brand\u2019s primary distribution platform in certain international markets such as Asia and parts of Latin America, where the wholesale channel is less developed. Between those operated by us and those operated by local partners around the world, we have 13 Polo stores today with approximately 15 to 20 planned for fiscal 2015. We are testing a variety of store formats as we refine our approach to market before accelerating growth. Over the long-term, we believe there is an opportunity to have between 100 and 200 Polo stores worldwide, and with also concentration in international markets. Our second initiative is the global e-commerce development. In fiscal 2014, we achieved $500 million in revenues through our directly operated e-commerce sites. That milestone was achieved as a result of sustained investment in the business, including distribution centers, customer service centers and building out our international operations. Based on the high growth and the profit creative dynamics of the channel, we intend to continue investing in this space. In fiscal \u201815, we will begin a three-year project to upgrade our e-commerce operations by transitioning to a new global operating platform. This is a proactive investment to advance our ability to continue to deliver best-in-class online and mobile customer experiences, as well as leverage omni channel opportunities more effectively. The global nature of the platform will provide a singular way for us to manage our customer touch points and experiences across regions and channels ensuring a consistent brand experience worldwide. With the additional capabilities of a more sophisticated platform, and an expectation of continued double-digit growth for the channel, we\u2019ve set our sights on achieving $1 billion in annual e-commerce revenues. The third initiative is accessories in general and leather goods in particular. I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on the excellent progress we\u2019ve made with our leather goods offerings which include handbags, footwear, belts and small leather goods. Beginning with footwear, which we converted from a licensed to owned model in 2006, we\u2019ve now spent two years reimagining our offerings and building the appropriate leadership, design talent and sourcing capabilities to elevate the quality and support our distribution and growth aspirations. We relaunched footwear in 2008 and have made tremendous progress since then establishing ourselves as an important player in the category. 2008 was also the year we assumed direct control of our handbag and small leather goods licenses. We\u2019ve grown the leather goods category at a 20% compound annual rate. As you know, we\u2019ve made big commitment to the Ricky bag as our most iconic silhouette. The customer response to the quality and versatility of the product, and to our advertising and marketing efforts has been extraordinary and the momentum continues to build. In total, handbags, footwear and small leather goods represented a high-single-digit percentage of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2014. We expect leather goods to grow faster than the overall company for the next several years, supported by expanded offerings and increased distribution. Our initial goal is for leather goods to represent 20% of our consolidated revenues, a target that should also have favorable margin implications. The three initiatives I\u2019ve just highlighted make it clear that we have a lot to achieve. With this in mind, we\u2019ve spent a considerable time developing and implementing the optimal leadership and organizational structure over this last year, one that we believe positions the company for continued growth and success. As you know, we recently appointed a President of Ralph Lauren Luxury Collections with global responsibility for the strategy, merchandizing, distribution and overall expansion of apparel and accessories for our men\u2019s and women\u2019s collection brands. We\u2019ve also made other important structural changes to our broader senior management group. These changes have moved some of our high performing talent into roles with more global oversight. This leverages their experience and subject matter expertise allows us to more easily and confidently apply successes in one channel or region to another and evolve the more regional orientation we had in the past. We have consolidated oversight of the Americas under one leader, which is consistent with how we manage our operations in Europe and Asia. This new structure should enable us to better execute an omni channel approach, more effectively leveraging our robust planning, allocation and merchandizing expertise. We also combined our sourcing and manufacturing operations with our distribution and logistics team, creating a fully integrated end-to-end supply chain organization. These changes are aligned with the progress we\u2019ve made in other areas of the company, such as the creation of the global merchandizing team we\u2019ve spoken about before and the more global oversight that Chris has instituted in finance and IT. We believe that this streamlining of responsibilities allows us to be more nimble and responsive as an organization and to operate with a higher degree of global consistency. This new structure will enable us to make faster decisions, drive greater operational efficiencies and build a more effective go-to-market process. The changes have all been well received by the organization and we are settling nicely into the new structure with Ralph, Chris and I spending the appropriate time to ensure that everyone is transitioning smoothly into their new roles. I am sure most of you have seen that Roger Farah will retire from Ralph Lauren at the end of May. We are enormously grateful for the leadership and dedication, Roger has provided over the last 14 years. In partnership with Ralph, he has guided the company to a period of tremendous growth in sales and profits. In doing so, he has built an impressive team and his characteristic balance of prudence and creativity is a legacy that is ingrained in our culture, and certainly in everyone he has mentored over the years. Roger, you are like none other and we wish you and your family all the best. The strength of the Ralph Lauren brand and the positive customer response to our expanding range of product offerings puts us in the best possible position to achieve our growth objectives. Before I turn the call over to Chris, on behalf of the office of the chairman, I\u2019d like to thank our global team for their contribution to our record fiscal 2014 results. As Ralph said in this morning\u2019s press release, their creativity, passion and diligence is incredibly invigorating and they are a critical ingredient in our ability to deliver sustainable, profit enhancing growth over the long-term. Chris Peterson : Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve seen in this morning\u2019s press release, we\u2019re reporting strong fourth quarter sales and profit results today. Let me start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 14% to $1.9 billion, reflecting robust wholesale segment growth and strong retail segment expansion. Revenue was up double-digits in each of our geographic regions during the quarter. The revenue results were better than the expectations we articulated in February due to stronger wholesale revenue as we gained market share in North America and returned to robust growth in Europe. For the full year, net revenues grew 7% to $7.4 billion and were up 9% excluding the impact of discontinued businesses and foreign exchange. Gross profit margin of 56.2% was 310 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the mix impacts from the integration of the Chaps men\u2019s sportswear operations, the mixed impact from stronger wholesale revenue growth and negative foreign currency effects in the quarter. Operating expenses rose 4% to $825 million, but the operating expense rate of 44.2% was 400 basis points below the prior year. We delivered substantial cost leverage on strong sales growth, which was achieved despite continued investments in the company\u2019s long-term strategic growth initiatives in infrastructure. Operating income rose an impressive 24% to $225 million in the fourth quarter, which was achieved on top of a 33% increase in the prior year period. Operating margin improved 90 basis points to 12%, which was at the high-end of the outlook we provided in February. Operating income of $1.1 billion for the full year of fiscal 2014 period was modestly above the prior year. Operating margin declined 100 basis points to 15.2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange and the mix impact from integrating the Chaps men\u2019s sportswear operations. Net income for the fourth quarter was $153 million, 20% greater than the prior year period and net income per diluted share increased 23% to $1.68. The significant increases in net income and net income per diluted share were achieved on top of strong double-digit increases in the prior year. Higher operating income drove the strong growth in net income and net income per share. The effective tax rate of 30% compared to 25% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201813 primarily due to a favorable discrete tax item in the prior year period. For fiscal 2014, net income rose 3% to $776 million, and net income per diluted share increased 5% to $8.43. Before I move onto segment level highlights, I want to discuss some changes we\u2019ve made in our segment reporting. As Jacki mentioned, we\u2019ve reshaped our organization structure to better support our long-term strategic growth objectives. Specifically, we\u2019ve expanded the scope and reach of our centralized global shared service organization. We believe this change will increase productivity by enabling faster and more consistent execution against the company\u2019s key growth strategies. It also provides an opportunity for us to leverage our scale in a more cost effective manner going forward. As a result, we\u2019ve organized key functions such as design, merchandizing, advertising, supply chain, finance and IT to operate on a global basis. And certain of those costs that used to be allocated to our wholesale, retail and licensing segments are now reflected in the unallocated corporate expense bucket. While this changes the financial information of our segments, as you see in this morning\u2019s press release, the change has no impact on the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Moving onto segment highlights for the quarter. Wholesale revenues of $983 million were an impressive 24% greater than the prior year period, driven by double-digit expansion for most merchandize categories in the Americas, including strong growth in accessories, the contribution from Chaps men\u2019s sportswear operations and double-digit growth in Europe. Wholesale operating income grew 25% to $296 million in the fourth quarter on top of double-digit growth in the prior year period. And wholesale operating margin increased 40 basis points to 30.1%. The improvement in wholesale operating margin was due to stronger profitability for core operations, which more than offsets the mix impacts from the integration of Chaps men\u2019s sportswear and negative foreign exchange effects. Fourth quarter retail segment sales rose 5% to $845 million, driven by growth in international operations and global store expansion, including newly transitioned operations in Australia and New Zealand. Excluding the impacts of discontinued businesses in foreign exchange, retail sales rose 7%. Our North America retail operations were negatively affected by the cold and late start to spring and the Easter shift from March to April, which caused traffic to decline during the quarter. Double-digit growth in our European and Asian retail sales was strong enough to overcome the pressure in North America. Retail segment operating income was $51 million in the fourth quarter and the retail operating margin was 6.1%, 400 basis points below the prior year. The lower retail operating income margin reflects costs associated with the company\u2019s global store and e-commerce development efforts and negative foreign exchange impacts. Retail operating margin was also affected by increased promotional activity in the U.S. where the promotional tenor of the marketplace intensified in the post-holiday period due to the unseasonable weather conditions. We anticipated a more intense promotional landscape when we provided our fourth quarter outlook in February, and our results actualized better than we expected at that point in time. Licensing revenues of $39 million in the fourth quarter were 10% below the prior year as mid-single-digit growth in licensing revenues for Ralph Lauren products was more than offset by lower revenues as a result of the Chaps and Australia/New Zealand license take-backs. Operating income for the licensing segment was $35 million, in line with the prior year period. Consolidated inventory was $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, reflecting incremental inventory associated with newly transitioned Chaps and Australia/New Zealand operations and investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings. We spent approximately $390 million on capital expenditures to support new retail stores, shop installations and infrastructure investments during the year. Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal \u201814 at a cost of $548 million, and returned an additional $149 million to shareholders via dividend repayments. In total, the company returned approximately $700 million to shareholders during the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, the company had $580 million available under previously authorized share repurchase programs for future buybacks, and we ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments. We are pleased with the strong fourth quarter and full year results, particularly with the accelerated top line trends. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to overcome meaningful foreign exchange and environmental headwinds and deliver higher profits even as we continue to make substantial investments in our global retail development and product innovation and in our infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives. Now I\u2019d like to turn to fiscal \u201815. As we articulated to you in February, we expect to maintain strong revenue growth this year. We are increasing our investments in the business to support that momentum and longer term shareholder value creation. The key areas of focus in fiscal \u201815 include global retail development, infrastructure investments and increased advertising and marketing. With respect to retail store development, we plan to open approximately 40 to 45 new stores in fiscal 2015, a pace we\u2019ll likely maintain over the next several years. As a result, we\u2019ll incur substantial increase in pre-opening costs, particularly since our plans included a handful of large high-profile stores that are scheduled to open in the next two years. Among the new store investments is a dual-gender Ralph Lauren flagship store in Hong Kong, as well as flagship stores for the Polo brand in New York and London. This confluence of flagship store activity is important to elevate the brand equity and image, but puts near-term pressure on our retail segment, as stores of that scale has significantly greater pre-opening costs and a lower profit contribution early in their development cycle. With respect to infrastructure, the largest area of investment continues to be SAP implementation. In fiscal 2015, we will be completing the transition of our North America wholesale operations from legacy systems to SAP, and we will begin the implementation process in Europe. Based on the current scope of the SAP initiative, fiscal \u201815 will likely represent the peak level of investment for us. While we anticipate substantial SAP costs in fiscal \u201816 and \u201817, we currently expect them to be below 2015 level. Over time, we believe SAP will enable productivity improvements and procurement savings in addition to providing the company with a robust global platform for future growth. We also intend to begin a three-year project to upgrade our global e-commerce operating platform. We\u2019ve been operating on our existing platform for over a decade. While it continues to serve us well, we are proactively investing in capabilities that we believe will support accelerated revenue growth through increased productivity and improved conversion rates. Consumers are clearly choosing to shop more online and our objective with the new platform is to create world-class shopping experiences that place us on the leading edge of the industry. To do this, we\u2019re moving to a more flexible platform, one that can better service a growing range of devices and enable more omni channel capabilities, as well as more sophisticated CRM activities that should drive stronger engagement, retention and repeat purchases. This initiative requires a mix of capital and operating expense that will likely intensify as the project progresses. We\u2019ve also planned to substantial increase in advertising and marketing. There are three main areas of investment, each of which is aligned with our core growth objectives. The first is incremental funds for Polo brand, largely to support the launch of women\u2019s Polo, the opening of the Polo flagship store in New York City and additional Polo stores around the world. Second main area is to improve our brand awareness in Greater China. We\u2019ve made excellent progress since opening the Prince\u2019s Building store last year, and we intent to build on that with stepped up outreach and messaging, including activities surrounding Ralph Lauren flagship store opening in Lee Gardens. Final area of investment is for our luxury products, both to support the strong trends we are experiencing and to showcase our accessories offerings. All totaled, our planned investment activities represent about 200 basis points of operating margin pressure for 2015 compared to 2014, with global retail development accounting for about half of that investment. We continue to expect these investments to deliver a rate of return that is well in excess of our cost of capital and they are meant to support shareholder value creation over the long-term. With that as backdrop, I\u2019d like to review our initial outlook for the year, which was outlined in this morning\u2019s press release. For the full year fiscal 2015 period, we expect consolidated revenues to increase by 6% to 8%, led by retail segment growth. Revenue growth is expected to be primarily organic, as there is no material contribution from license take-backs this year and we expect foreign exchange impacts to be relatively neutral. We expect our full year fiscal 2015 operating margin to be approximately 75 to 125 basis points below fiscal 2014 level, due to accelerated investment in our strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure. Excluding the impacts of the incremental investment in the company\u2019s strategic growth initiatives, underlying operating income growth would be up low-double-digits for the year. Our fiscal 2015 tax rate is expected to be 30%. A higher level of investment that\u2019s flowing through the P&L is also reflected in our capital spending plans. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments, as well as wholesale shop development for the women\u2019s Polo launch. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect consolidated net revenues to increase by 3% to 5%, led by retail segment growth, as wholesale segment sales are expected to be essentially in line with the prior year period. Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 300 basis points to 350 basis points below the prior year period, primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments to support the company\u2019s strategic growth objectives. In addition, we will not be anniversarying the one-time gain on the Chaps acquisition that we had in the prior year period, which accounts for about 100 basis points of this decline. The first quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. Our opportunities for growth are tremendous and our strategies are clear. We are focused on executing with excellence and are committed to being prudent stewards of capital and global brand development. The investments we are making in our long-term growth initiatives along with our new management structure are intended to maximize our sales and profit growth over the long-term. At this point, we\u2019d like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that? Operator : (Operator Instructions) One moment please for the first question. The first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is open. Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group : Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for all the color heading into \u201815. It\u2019s really helpful. I wanted to ask you a question to maybe get you to elaborate a little bit on some of the realignments in the organizational shifts that are going on and the shared services, especially in the context of the recent announcement around Valerie becoming the President of the Luxury Ralph Lauren brands. Are you going to do something similar maybe with the Polo brand as its growing, and how it kind of all fits together and what\u2019s some of the benefits do you think are some of these realignments around the org structure? Thanks. Jacki Nemerov : What we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve really looked at our overall structure, and what our plan was to consolidate our viewpoint of all three regions. So Europe and Asia had already had a consolidated approach between our retail business and our wholesale business. We decided that there was value in doing that in the Americas, and in looking at the overall business in the region between North America and now South Americas in that world, and to be able to really strategize our viewpoint in an omni channel way. So to really look across our wholesale businesses, our retail businesses and make the best decisions as to how we should move forward in the region, rather than with a more siloed approach that we had operated under. So the leadership of that is under Joy Herfel, who has spent 25 years in our company and ran our Polo and children\u2019s businesses, and has obviously run our biggest and most profitable businesses within the company. Reporting to Joy is Kim Roy, who is Head of our U.S. Wholesale business, also a veteran of Ralph Lauren and has been with the company for 11 years. Has done an outstanding job in building the world of Lauren and Chaps and has great visibility during that time for the \u2013 to strengthen the balance of our wholesale division. And Kim is often running in her new role. We also promoted and expanded Don Baum\u2019s role, who was Head of all of Manufacturing and Sourcing. We really saw great benefit in combining manufacturing sourcing with supply chain, and Don now has full oversight of that end-to-end seamless execution from beginning to the end of process from distribution out to our stores and our customers. And we believe that there will be great benefit overtime in the seamless and view of that organization. We\u2019ve also had very strong success in our merchandizing organization by taking a global view in our product and our presentation worldwide. And led by David Rosenberg, we started with the consolidation in our men\u2019s merchandizing world and now we are expanding that based on its success addressing SKU count and a more cohesive presentation around the world to the balance of our businesses. And that\u2019s moving along quite well. Valerie in her new role is focused on our luxury opportunity. As you know, Valerie comes to us with tremendous experience. Spent her career in that sector, and we believe that there is great opportunity in building both our apparel and of course our accessory business under her leadership. In addition, we brought in Denise Incandela, who is now heading \u2013 came from Saks Fifth Avenue is now heading our online business. And we are very excited about having Denise on board, and the understanding of this space, both as a merchant and as a marketer, as you know she had the CMO role as well in Saks, and think there are many opportunities that we have not yet taken advantage of that Denise has really brought to the table. So, as we are looking at our entire organization and we are looking at the strength of that leadership and the past seven months that we\u2019ve all been operating under this structure, we\u2019ve already seen some very, very positive results. And our Polo brand is really built centrally designed, merchandized, marketed and then distributed in the regions, each taking that as a key centerpiece for what we believe the opportunities are going forward, both in Polo stores, Polo product expansion with women\u2019s and clothing for men\u2019s and of course with the exciting entry into the market of our new store on Fifth Avenue, which is expected to open at around Labor Day, and then of course the Ralph Lauren Restaurant that will follow that opening. So that kind of summarizes our leadership changes. Chris Peterson : The other thing I would say, Omar, to your question is that, as we\u2019re \u2013 really a lot of these moves are meant to globalize the company. And it starts with an underpinning from a system standpoint which is what the SAP project is about, which is what the e-commerce re-platforming project is about. A lot of the management moves that we\u2019re doing are taking multiple organizations that we had acquired over the years through license take-backs that operated in silos, and combining organizations so that instead of doing the same job three times or four times, we do it once. And over time, what we believe and what we\u2019re already starting to see opportunity for is we think that\u2019s going to lead to significant opportunity for cost leverage, which should result in SG&A leverage overtime as we get into the new structure and as we begin to leverage. It also should allow us to be more consistent as a brand across the world, and it should allow us to rollout faster new initiatives from an innovation standpoint. So we\u2019re excited about it. I think we\u2019re early days into sort of this globalization. And I think a lot of these themes are going to play out more fully when we get into fiscal \u201816 than in fiscal \u201815. James Hurley : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS: Good morning guys. I guess two quick questions here. One is, as I think about the factory outlets in the U.S. I think those have been struggling with traffic for a lot of last year. And those are obviously very big percent of the U.S. retail comps. Can you tell us a little bit more about your thinking in that channel based on what you\u2019re seeing now, and if you think sales there turn back to positive in fiscal \u201815? And then Chris, you also talked about \u2013 obviously gave us a lot of good color on a number of initiatives that are baked into the SG&A guidance for this year. There was a lot of projects that have varying durations, and as we look at the longer term comments that you\u2019re making and think about our models which tend to focus on longer term for the Ralph Lauren company in particular, how you guys are thinking about maybe some of the payback period analysis that you did, or whether the EBIT margins can start to expand as soon as fiscal \u201816? Thanks. Chris Peterson : Okay. I\u2019ll start with the factory channel. So in the fourth quarter, we saw actually very good growth in the factory channel in Europe and Asia. The U.S. factory business was down in the fourth quarter and that was because we saw traffic \u2013 again our fourth quarter is Jan through March, and the traffic trend that we experienced in the fourth quarter was down double-digits in traffic in that period, which had a significant impact in the company\u2019s comps. The encouraging part of that is that in the first quarter, to-date, the first part of April and May, we\u2019re already seeing the traffic trends reaccelerate in the U.S. to the factory outlet channel. So we\u2019re seeing not the same trend that we saw in January-March in the U.S. market. From a longer term perspective on some of the margin trends going forward. I think you\u2019re right that some of the things have different payback periods. So I would characterize if you wanted to parse it into two broad areas. The infrastructure investments that we\u2019re making, whether it be SAP or the e-commerce platform, we\u2019re likely to be in investment mode on an aggregate of those two things for a couple of years, because the e-commerce re-platforming is a two or three year project, where you\u2019re investing before you turn on the new platform. On the flipside, the Polo investments that we\u2019re making, whether it be women\u2019s Polo or the flagship stores, the start of the rollout of new stores, we should start seeing and be able to report a much stronger progress on that as we get towards the end of this fiscal year, because we\u2019ll have experience in the market when women\u2019s Polo launches in the fall, and we\u2019ll began to get some initial reads from the stores that we\u2019re opening. So it\u2019s too soon for us to say how all of that nets together from a fiscal \u201816 and beyond perspective externally, because we typically provide guidance one year out, but that\u2019s a little bit of how we expect the underlying trends to play out. James Hurley : Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research. David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research : Thank you. Just continuing on that trend, I think the concern that we\u2019re hearing from investors is that the operating margin has been down, let\u2019s just call it 100 basis points a year FY\u201914 and then kind of taking the midpoint in FY\u201915. You\u2019ve given us a lot of qualitative. I mean is it reasonable to assume that you could see at least some margin stabilization in FY\u201916 assuming that the Polo initiative and the new store openings open as you plan them? And then second for Jacki. Just when will we start to see the Polo women\u2019s merchandize in stores? And I am curious what to make up the American Living appearance at Macy\u2019s, whether that\u2019s a significant opportunity for you guys? Chris Peterson : So I guess on the operating margin. Let me start with fiscal \u201814 just to make sure we\u2019re clear. So in fiscal \u201814, the primary driver of the operating margin being down in fiscal \u201814 versus the year ago was foreign exchange. So if you took out the impact of foreign exchange on our profitability, our earnings per share would be up double-digits in fiscal \u201814. In fiscal \u201815, I think we\u2019ve provided perspective around the impacts of the investments, which together account for 200 basis points of the operating margin pressure, which the midpoint of our guidance range is down 100 basis points. So if you looked at the operating margin excluding those investments, the operating margin would be up 100 basis points in fiscal \u201815. As I mentioned on fiscal \u201816, there is going to be varying impacts of these investments, because they have different payback periods. And we\u2019ll provide more color on that in our normal guidance pattern as we go forward. Jacki Nemerov : On Polo women\u2019s, David, we\u2019ll start to ship Polo women\u2019s in mid-to-end August and the first impact will be in our retail stores over the Labor Day weekend, and in our wholesale customers approximately the same time. We are building beautiful shops as a backdrop for the Polo women\u2019s brand. We have a lot of confidence in that opportunity, and feel that, as I said we can get relation to what we are doing in Polo men\u2019s and which we\u2019re fairly confident about that we can really grow that business and we\u2019re really excited about our fall shipments for that brand. As it relates to American Living, as you know we had exclusively at J.C. Penny up until the time that they have their change in management. And for many reasons we decided to withdraw the brand from J.C. Penny. Interestingly, we had built it into quite a big successful volume brand for J.C. Penny and felt that it had that a great future and kind of put it on the sidelines until we could determine what the next opportunity might be. We had a great conversation with Macy\u2019s and we decided that we would utilize the American Living brand in conjunction with their American Icon marketing strategy which incorporates Memorial Day into July 4 into Labor Day. And so we shipped the brand for beginning of April. And it has been a very exciting launch so far, and we are very, very pleased with the results. We have another concept package going in for holiday. And then I believe we\u2019ll determine how we build the brand and opportunity from there. And that\u2019s \u2013 as I said, it\u2019s very early days at this point, but nice results. James Hurley : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks, good morning. Is there any sales pulled into Q4 from Q1 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing deceleration in the Q1 top line guidance, or just Q1 fiscal year \u201815. And is there a change in guidance as you conveyed today on the top line, I had noted that you were guiding high-single-digits for fiscal year \u201815 and now 6% to 8% it seems a little bit lower than that, so I was hoping you can reconcile that for us? Thanks. Chris Peterson : Sure. So on the first question, I would say, yes. There was a little bit of shift in timing of the wholesale business. March and April are in a lot of cases viewed somewhat together. And so we do have a set of shipments that go out March 25. Some of those shipments went out a little bit early at the request of our customers, but it wasn\u2019t a material impact. One of the key drivers of that is Easter. So I think it\u2019s probably a fair comment that looking at the wholesale business on a rolling basis as opposed to a quarter-to-quarter basis is a more accurate \u2013 is a better reflection of the trends in that business. And you see that in our guidance for the first quarter where we had very strong wholesale shipments in the January-March period, but in the April to June period, we\u2019re effectively guiding wholesale shipments about flat versus year ago. Over the six month period, it will be a very strong wholesale pick-up. On the top line for the total company, yes, we expect high-single-digits. I think 6% to 8% is consistent with that in my view. So there is really no change in our thinking there going forward. James Hurley : Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just to follow-up on that question. It sounds as if \u2013 even if we were to adjust for some of the shipment timing that you U.S. wholesale business is still running up very strong high-single, maybe a low-double-digit type of growth. Is that \u2013 first of all, am I right in thinking about it that way? And second of all, do you contemplate that sort of growth rate continuing as we move into the back part of the year? And for your sales guidance of the 6% to 8% for the full year, how much incremental sales from these new initiatives are contemplated in that guidance? Chris Peterson : So yes, I would say that the U.S. wholesale business continues to operate very strongly. If you look at the sell-out of the business and our customers, we continue to gain share consistently in that channel. I think the other encouraging thing in our wholesale segment results, is as we talked about at the last call, we had made a strategic pullback in shipments primarily in Southern Europe on the specialty store channel. We\u2019ve now annualized that, and so we\u2019re starting to see a return to strong wholesale growth in the European business as well. And so we had a double-digit increase in wholesale in the quarter in Europe as well. So I think the trends in our wholesale business broadly are very encouraging, and I think we expect them to continue. On the new initiatives, I think the 6% to 8% revenue growth is effectively organic growth in our view. There is no acquisitions in that. There is no foreign exchange in that. I think the women\u2019s Polo impact during the year is going to be somewhat muted, because we\u2019re launching in fall, so we\u2019ll have a part year impact, and we\u2019re replacing the Blue Label business. And so during the transition, I think we see opportunity, but I think we see even stronger opportunity as we begin to get into fiscal \u201816, as we really get behind the women\u2019s Polo line, and as we open more freestanding Polo stores. James Hurley : Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie. Liz Dunn \u2013 Macquarie Capital : Hi, thanks for taking my question. If Roger is listening, best of luck. It\u2019s been an absolute pleasure. And Jacki and Chris, thank you so much for all the detail, particularly quantifying some of the things like e-commerce and the amount of pressure that you\u2019re expecting next year on the operating margin. In terms of that 6% to 8%, I don\u2019t mean to keep hitting the same point, but does that imply that as we go forward perhaps beyond fiscal \u201815 that the 6% to 8% will accelerate or could potentially accelerate as some of these growth initiatives begin to really kick in? And then relative to the accessories business, are you Jacki, do you think that the progress that we\u2019ve seen so far has been slower than you anticipated, or is it just one of these businesses that takes time to build and now you\u2019re finally seeing some signs that that growth is beginning to accelerate? Thanks. Chris Peterson : I\u2019ll address the long-term revenue growth. So on the long-term revenue growth, I think our view is that we\u2019d like to try to target high-single-digit growth, sort of on a continuous basis, but in any given year I think we want to be prepared for mid-single-digit growth. And a lot of it\u2019s going to depend on the macroeconomic environment, the timing of initiatives, the timing of store openings. But I think our goal, if you will, is to try to be a consistent high-single-digit type of grower. Jacki Nemerov : On the accessory front, Liz, I think that we are pleased with our introduction, beginning in accessories in 2008 as that was not a core competence of the company, and we have made it one since in two critical areas, one being the luxury accessory business. And I think that over this last year, we\u2019ve seen some great traction with the Ricky and continue to fuel that opportunity. We\u2019ve also had some great success with our Lauren accessory business. And we are seeing very nice growth in that brand as well. So I would say that in our whole leather goods category, we\u2019ve accomplished a 20% compound annual rate growth. So, look, we always hope for more, but we are pleased with where we are and we think we finally have put in the right foundations to continue to build from. James Hurley : Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping, if you could follow up on the strength that you saw in Europe in the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more about country specific regional trends that you are seeing? And then with the pace of wholesale growth there, should we assume that whether you are also seeing that type of double-digit growth in the fall order books? Thank you. Chris Peterson : Yes. So I guess if I were to step back and talk about Europe for the year, we\u2019ve pretty consistently grown our retail segment revenues in Europe, double-digits every quarter for the past year, but we saw wholesale really start to accelerate a little bit in the third quarter and then get to double-digits in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s what allowed us to translate into double-digit growth in Europe in the fourth quarter, with both, retail and the wholesale at that pace. I think we\u2019re at a place where we expect that to continue in terms of revenue growth going forward in a strong way. If you look at the trends within the region, I think we\u2019re seeing the U.K. is probably the strongest part of our business, the GDP has improved there markedly. I think we\u2019re seeing Southern Europe stabilize. So it\u2019s no longer going down, it\u2019s not necessarily going up, but it\u2019s stabilizing. And I think we\u2019re seeing some strength in the Scandinavia region in Germany and some stability in France. The other encouraging trend that I would point to in Europe is that, as we\u2019ve invested in resetting the brand image in Greater China, particularly with the opening of the men\u2019s Prince\u2019s flagship store and a number of the other luxury stores, we\u2019re starting to see the Chinese tourist business in Europe increase at a significant rate, off of a low base, but we\u2019re up very, very strong double-digits in terms of our business to Chinese tourists in Europe, which is helping to fuel the growth of that business right now. And we think as we open the Lee Gardens flagship store and increase the marketing and advertising spending behind Greater China, where we have a low awareness, we think that\u2019s going to translate through both in Europe and in the U.S. business. James Hurley : Operator, we\u2019re ready for our last question. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays. Joan Payson \u2013 Barclays Capital : Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask another question on Europe actually and the Polo full price opportunity in particular. Given your store network over there, how many retail stores do you think the region could support overall? And you also mentioned the 100 to 200 store number for Polo full price being a little more weighted towards Asia and Latin America, but how do you really think about the allocation in terms of the regional perspective with those? Chris Peterson : I think we see a big opportunity for full price stores in Europe. We\u2019re in the middle of prioritizing locations around the world and we\u2019re doing it on a global basis. I think, we think there is both in opportunity in Western Europe and we think there is an opportunity in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East for Polo stores. If you think about the allocation of that 100 to 200, I would expect that maybe we could have 20% to 30% of those stores in Europe over time. Jacki Nemerov : We\u2019re excited also about our London opening on Regent Street for Polo, which we believe will set the tone for Polo in Europe. Chris Peterson : All right. Well, thank you for joining us this morning. I think we\u2019re pleased with the fourth quarter results that we have reported today I think. And we\u2019re looking forward to coming out and talking more about it and following up with you. And please feel free to call Jim or myself with any additional questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect",

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead. James Hurley : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. The agenda for today's call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of the quarter and comment on our broader strategic initiatives; Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide operational and financial perspective in the first quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of the year. [Operator Instructions] During today's call, we'll be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jacki. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong start to our new fiscal year with better-than-expected first quarter profits. The consistent focus on our long-term strategic growth objectives is clearly evidenced in the results. Revenue growth of 3.4% was supported by strong Retail segment performance, including double-digit expansion for both international markets and e-commerce. Operating margin of 14.3% was better than we anticipated in May, largely due to excellent operational discipline throughout the organization, even as we continue to make significant investments in our long-range goals. As most of you are well aware, the first 6 months of calendar 2014 have been difficult for retailers around the world. Trends have been particularly challenging in North America where the cold and late start to spring caused many consumers to effectively sit out the spring/summer season. Geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic pressures in Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia have also had an impact on consumer spending. Despite that landscape as a backdrop, our brands and products performed very well in the first quarter. We achieved double-digit growth in Europe, led by continued strength in our retail operations and increased hotel shipments for the spring/summer season. We also delivered double-digit expansion in Asia, including positive growth for our Japanese retail operations despite a VAT increase during the quarter. Revenues in the Americas were modestly below the prior year as growth for our retail operations was more than offset by lower wholesale revenues, primarily due to a shift in timing of certain shipments between quarters. Merchandising highlights for the quarter include continued global strength in our men's assortments. The response to our expanded Purple Label offering has been very positive and is especially important as we execute our luxury strategy on an increasingly global scale. We introduced our first collection of Polo tailored clothing as a directly operated business during the quarter, and the initial read is very strong with consumers taking note of how we've refined the fit and elevated the fabrications. I also want to highlight the performance of our newest men's fragrance, Polo Red, which has achieved the distinction of becoming our most successful men's fragrance launch to date. That's a noteworthy accomplishment considering our already strong position in the men's fragrance market. Turning to our Women's business. Customers have really responded to the more modern sensibility of our Black Label line. Dresses also continued to perform across all of our women's labels, fueled by new silhouettes and fabrications across the range of casual, wear-to-work, social and special location. Women's accessories had strong momentum during the quarter with excellent growth in handbags and footwear. And last, but not least, our Club Monaco brand continues to show strength worldwide, thanks to its distinctive contemporary styling and compelling visual presentation. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on 3 of our key areas of strategic focus : product innovation, global retail development and advertising and marketing. Beginning with product innovation, we will mark an important evolution in our women's offering in just a few weeks with the introduction of Women's Polo. This line has been developed to complement the breadth and scope of our tremendously successful and iconic Polo men's brand that commands a leadership position in the marketplace. From sophisticated tweeds and rugged outdoorsy looks to the perfect little black dress or distressed leather jacket, Women's Polo brings all-American style up-to-date with an eclectic downtown edge. The long-term global opportunity for Women's Polo is extremely exciting, and we look forward to consumers discovering the merchandise over the next few seasons. Moving on to global retail development. We opened 12 stores during the first quarter, 5 that we operate directly and 7 with international partners. We are on track to open 40 to 45 directly operated stores this fiscal year, including a few strategically important stores this fall. Our first Polo flagship will open in a few weeks on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street in New York City. This 3-level store will present a comprehensive assortment of Polo men's and women's apparel and accessories and will also have a restaurant and a caf\u00e9. This store is just the beginning of a global rollout that will take place over the next several years and will be quickly followed by an 8,000-square foot Polo store in Singapore that's scheduled to open in mid-September. Later this fall, we will open our first Ralph Lauren luxury flagship in Greater China. Located in Hong Kong's Lee Gardens shopping district, we look forward to the opportunity to showcase the brand in one of the most important markets. We expect this store to have a beneficial impact on our global business as Chinese consumers are a driving force in virtually every major market. E-commerce is another critical component of our global retail development efforts. Double-digit e-commerce growth in the quarter was the result of a double-digit increase in traffic and improved conversion, all of which reflects our continued investment in infrastructure, technology, user experience, customer service and marketing. Our focus on e-commerce is, of course, global. And we are very pleased with the momentum we are experiencing in Europe and also in Asia where we have now added ship-to capability for Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore. World-class advertising and marketing is one of the hallmarks of our company and one of our points of distinction as a brand. It is also an area of increased investment for us this year. Our most significant campaign this fall will be a celebration of the Polo brand through a large scale 360-program that will introduce the new women's line and present the season statement for men. While still respecting the rich heritage of Polo, the imagery beautifully expresses the energy and fresh spirit of this exciting new offering and conveys a distinctive, modern point of view that we believe will resonate with the target consumer. The foundational digital and social media elements of the campaign will be reinforced by in-store video, magazine advertising and robust men's and women's direct mail pieces. Right now, we are in the midst of our Sports of Summer campaign, which brings together the power of the high-profile partnerships we have cultivated over the years from Wimbledon and the US Open in tennis, to the British Open, the US Open and the Ryder Cup in golf. The quality and prestige that define these events align perfectly with the values of our brand and we are extremely proud of these associations. The same is true of our philanthropic efforts. During the quarter, we made a donation to fund the Ralph Lauren Center for Breast Cancer Research at London's Royal Marsden Hospital that was graciously accepted by Prince William at a spectacular gala at Windsor Castle. Back in America, our sponsorship of the restoration of the Star-Spangled Banner, one of our nation's most important icons, was once again recognized when Ralph was awarded the prestigious James Smithson Bicentennial Medal. We also brought visibility and support to children's literacy through our Fall '14 Children's Fashion Show that was held at the New York Public Library. We are extremely pleased to support all of these important causes. I'm very proud of our team's ability to deliver better-than-expected profits while navigating challenging market conditions and continuing to build for future growth. We are fueling the increasingly global appeal of our brands and products with prudent investments in infrastructure, best-in-class shopping environment and advertising and marketing. I'm pleased to report that the early fall selling is off to a good start and we have several merchandising and marketing initiatives in place to support that momentum. Our priorities are clear and we have both the talent and the financial strength to execute them. We are excited about what we expect to achieve over the next several years as we continue to focus our capital and managerial resources on the most compelling long-term opportunities. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Christopher H. Peterson: Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2015 is off to a good start, with first quarter profit exceeding the outlook we provided in May. I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 3.4% to $1.7 billion, led by strong retail segment growth and double-digit expansion in international markets. Gross profit margin of 61.0% was 30 basis points above the prior year period due to favorable channel and geographic mix that was partially offset by negative foreign currency effects. Operating margin of 14.3% was 240 basis points below the prior year period. This was better than the outlook we provided in May as disciplined operational management throughout the organization mitigated the impacts of incremental investments in our long-term growth strategies and infrastructure, higher restructuring charges and a onetime gain on the Chaps men's license acquisition that benefited the prior year period. Net income was $162 million, 10% below the first quarter of fiscal 2014, and net income per diluted share declined 7% to $1.80. The effective tax rate of 31% in the first quarter was slightly below the prior year, but was higher than we expected due to a couple of minor discrete tax items. The diluted share count declined approximately 3 million shares from the prior year as the company continues to return capital to shareholders through its share repurchase program. Moving on to segment highlights for the quarter. Wholesale revenues of $708 million were 4% below the prior year due to shifts in shipment cadence between quarters and higher revenues from the initial transition of Chaps men's sportswear to a wholly owned operation in the prior year period. Wholesale revenues were slightly below our initial expectations mostly due to a shift in the timing of certain summer and fall shipments out of the first quarter and into the second quarter. Combining wholesale sales for the last 2 quarters, which is a good proxy for the spring/summer season, revenues increased 10%, reflecting strong momentum in the Americas and a return to growth in Europe. Wholesale operating margin declined 260 basis points in the quarter to 25.5% due to fixed cost deleverage on lower shipment volumes and unfavorable foreign currency effects. Retail sales rose 9% to $960 million driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and double-digit growth in international markets and e-commerce operations. Comparable store sales increased 3% during the quarter supported by higher average unit retail prices, a modest increase in traffic to brick-and-mortar stores and strong e-commerce growth. Our focus on client engagement and more targeted marketing efforts supported positive comp growth for all of our retail concepts except concession shops. Retail operating margin was 17.5%, 130 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting costs associated with global store development and newly transitioned operations. Licensing revenue and operating income each rose 4% in the first quarter due to higher royalties from higher sales of Ralph Lauren products worldwide. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings, as well as incremental inventory associated with newly transitioned operations. We spent about $85 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure investments. Company also repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of approximately $152, utilizing $180 million of authorized share repurchase programs. At the end of the quarter, $400 million remained available for future buybacks and we had $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. We established the company's first ever commercial paper program during the first quarter and we've issued approximately $20 million of the $300 million program in the second quarter to date period. We intend to access this very low-cost financing from time-to-time to support the growth of the business in the most capital-efficient way. So overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which clearly demonstrate our ability to deliver better-than-expected profits despite a challenging environment while making important progress on several of our long-term objectives. The team's skill of balancing near-term market realities and our commitment to our long-range goals is the defining characteristic of the organization. Last quarter, we spoke about how we are working to globalize the company and the changes we made to our leadership structure to achieve that goal. We've been operating in this new structure for about 3 months, and I'd like to provide some early perspective on the benefits using our newly integrated supply chain organization as an example. We currently source products from over 700 factories and 40 countries and then ship those goods to over 100 countries processed through 13 global distribution centers. While the company has done a great job optimizing its sourcing and logistics activities individually, we believe that there was an opportunity to drive additional benefits through end-to-end integration of the supply chain. The team's holistic view enables us to determine the most time- and cost-effective solutions for the company. Key areas of opportunity include leveraging our logistics expertise earlier in the supply chain, taking a more seamless approach to vendor relations and customer service, optimizing inventory across channels and regions and improving speed-to-market. This should lead to higher revenue and lower cost of goods over time and we're excited about what it might mean for us over the long term. Now I'd like to turn to the outlook for fiscal 2015. As we articulated to you in May, we expect to maintain strong revenue growth this year. We are increasing our investments in the business to support that momentum and long-term shareholder value creation. As you recall, the fiscal 2015 plan calls for incremental investment and expanding our global store network and e-commerce operations, including important flagship projects; implementing SAP; and increased advertising and marketing to support exciting new initiatives, such as the launch of Women's Polo and high-profile store openings. As you've seen in this morning's press release, we are maintaining our financial outlook for the year. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to increase by 6% to 8% for the full year fiscal 2015 period led by retail segment growth. As a reminder, this growth is primarily organic as there is no material contribution from license take-backs this year. And we continue to expect foreign exchange impacts to be relatively neutral. The full year 2015 operating margin is still estimated to be approximately 75 to 125 basis points below fiscal 2014's level due to accelerated investment in our strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure. Excluding the impacts of the incremental investments in the company's strategic growth initiatives, underlying operating income growth would be up low double digits for the year. For the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect consolidated net revenues to increase by 4% to 6%, once again led by retail segment growth. Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 250 basis points below the prior year period, primarily due to higher operating expenses related to the timing of investments to support the company's strategic growth objectives. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. Based on our first quarter results and second quarter outlook, we expect our recent investments in new stores, e-commerce operations and international expansion to contribute to accelerated sales and profit momentum in the second half of the year. We are mindful that global macroeconomic data are giving mixed signals on the health of the consumer, but we remain focused on disciplined expense management while we continue to invest in our longer-term growth objectives. The diversity of our operating model across channels, regions and merchandising categories is a competitive advantage. It's enabled us to manage through an uncertain global environment effectively while still achieving our financial goals. We are confident that the investments we're making today will support sustainable and profitable growth over the long term. At this point, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Wanted to ask a holistic question about the Polo brand, if you don't mind. The Singapore store, which we learned about today, obviously you've got the one opening in New York, the Polo Women's rollout, can you -- and the plan, I think, you said in the past, 15 to 20 potential openings this year, can you talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace that gives you the comfort level to kind of make this push around that brand in women's and in stores -- in store openings. What's the data that you're seeing? I know you have some Polo stores out there already. Talk to -- help talk us through the confidence level there that's giving you the impetus to make this push. Christopher H. Peterson: Yes, I think what we're seeing is Polo -- the Polo brand continues to resonate very strongly with consumers on the men's side of the business. As you know, we're just launching Women's Polo now and the response that we've seen from customers and from consumers to the showroom exposure that we've given has been very strong and from the fashion press has been very strong to the Polo Women's lineup. We've only had the Polo Women's brand and market for about 2 weeks in really a couple of stores, though the Women's Polo launch is really going to be more broadly distributed over the next couple of months as we get into the fall season. But we're starting to already see very encouraging trends from the first few distribution points that we've had on the Women's Polo line. So I think we think with the strength of the Polo brand globally, with the launch of the flagship store in New York, with the launch of the Women's Polo line, which really is a new brand introduction for us and with some of the other exciting things that Jacki talked about on the men's tailored clothing lineup, we think we have a lot of product innovation and news behind that brand that gives us the confidence to expand the Polo distribution through freestanding retail stores worldwide. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I have 2 questions, one will be a little bit more near term and then one longer term for you, Chris. I think, after today, the focus is likely to shift to getting comfortable with the annual guidance. And in particular, I think the mid-point of your guidance implies revenue growth stepping up to a run rate of about plus 9% or 10% in the back half from about plus 4% in the first half. Obviously, we have big store openings as a catalyst. But the compares in wholesale get very tough, and just in general, you're a very big brand at this point, so those high-single numbers are obviously not easy. So maybe kind of the help you could give us on some of the components that make the revenue target achievable in your eyes would be really helpful. And then on a longer-term question, of course, you guys have a lot of investments coming on this year and have mentioned they'll span multiple years and maybe the timing of the impacts of those investments may be uneven. But if we look out 2 or even 3 years, how do you think about some of the biggest drivers of margin leverage for the company as we get past this investment cycle. In other words, is rolling off the step-up in retail openings is the biggest opportunity? Or maybe even just some of the opportunities, a different SAP module starts to come on and how big that could be as far as leverage opportunities going forward. Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So let me start with the first one on the current fiscal year. So I think if you look at the trajectory of the current fiscal year, what we're seeing is that the peak quarter for our investment spending is really the second quarter that we're just about to enter here. And many of the strategic investments that we're making are going to have significant revenue impacts that impact the back half of the year. And that includes both a number of the retail stores that we're opening, whether it's the Fifth Avenue Polo store, the Lee Garden flagship store, the Singapore store and a number of others that will have a much more significant impact in terms of revenue growth in the back half than the front half. The second thing I would say on that is that when we look at our plan from a wholesale standpoint and from an e-commerce standpoint around the world, we're anticipating, from the visibility that we've had through bookings and through some of the initiatives that we have coming, acceleration in those businesses as well in the back half of the year versus the front half of the year. Recall that for the spring/summer season, if you look at the last 2 quarters, combined, in wholesale, we generated 10% revenue growth. So we're coming off very successful spring/summer season relative to the competitive environment. So that characterizes, if you will, the current fiscal year. I think if you look at the longer-term perspective about the investments and how is this likely to play out over the next several years, I think the thing that we're looking at is that if you look at some of the investments that we're making in infrastructure, we believe that whether it's SAP, whether it's the e-commerce replatforming effort or other infrastructure investments that we're making, those infrastructure investments I would characterize in the short term as being primarily in the investment mode. But I think we're going to start to see the benefits from those increase and the investment spending decrease as it plays out over the next several years. These are multiyear projects. But that should lead to improved margins over the mid- to long term on that part of the spending. If you look at the marketing and advertising step-up that we're doing this year, I think that marketing and advertising step-up, we believe, is right for the long-term brand equity and health of the business. And I think we expect that step-up in marketing and advertising to lead to stronger consumer demand over time, certainly as we increase our awareness in countries that have low awareness today like Greater China, but also as we increase the desirability and demand for the product in our more established markets. And then, if you look at the global retail store development spending -- step-up in spending that we're doing this year, I think what you're going to see there is we're likely to be at an accelerated pace for the next several years as we begin to -- or as we continue to expand the retail stores around the world, particularly in international markets. But I think the onetime sort of step-up of preopening costs that's hitting us this year is likely to be more consistent year-over-year as we get to the outer years. And we'll start to see the benefits from some of the stores that we're opening today flow through from a revenue and profitability standpoint. Operator : The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Chris, in that context, as you talk about how the year unfolds, I was just -- we're just looking at the U.S. business. Obviously, it was down modestly in the quarter primarily due to shifts. But how do you think about the U.S. or North America from a wholesale and retail perspective sort of indexed against that sort of 9% to 10% back half growth? Some investors question whether you've kind of hit a maturity level in the U.S. and there may not be growth there. I was just wondering if you could give us some perspective on that. And then, a second question for Jacki. Another question I get from investors is the relevance of the portfolio of Ralph Lauren brands to younger consumers and your strategy to address that going forward to continue to make the brand relevant to millennials, for example. Christopher H. Peterson: So I think I'll take the first question and then hand over to Jacki. I think if you look at the geographic trends, I think that, certainly, we're expecting the international business to grow at an accelerated pace versus the U.S. business. The U.S. business is our most mature business. It represents about 2/3 of the company's revenue. And we have very strong positions, leading positions, in most of the categories in which we compete in the U.S. So we do have a plan that we believe will generate market share gains in the U.S. for the balance of the year. But if the U.S. market, broadly defined as growing sort of at a low-single-digit rate, I think we have a plan that allows us to grow faster than that, but likely not at the sort of high-single-digits is baked in. I think where we get to those types of numbers from a consolidated view is because we have a much more aggressive revenue plan, if you will, in the international markets. And that has to do with the fact that in many of these markets, we are under-distributed relative to the potential size of the markets. So I think we've talked a little bit in the past that 2/3 of our business is in the U.S., but 2/3 of the market is outside of the U.S. So if we were able to capture the same market share outside of the U.S. that we have inside the U.S., it would imply the international business would be 4x as big as it is today. We're not going to get there this year. But certainly, we think we've got an opportunity for accelerated growth in the international markets and I think we've seen that play out in the first quarter with strong double-digit growth in Europe and double-digit growth in Asia as well. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: So David, on the relevance of our Ralph Lauren brands and the appeal to younger consumers, this is something that the company is highly focused on, starting with Ralph, and it's continuous. The -- it's something, as we look at our Polo portfolio, let me start with Polo Women's. When you see the product, our advertising campaign, the attitude of the way the product is styled and the environment in which we have placed the consumer, you will see that this is the centerpiece of the appeal of the Polo Women's brand. We've already, although it's just in the first couple of weeks as the product has started to hit some of our stores, we're absolutely seeing that younger consumer responding to the brand. And it's in attitude, it's in fit and the overall appeal, while keeping our heritage, the spirit of the brand, the fit of the brand, really is driven towards this young contemporary customer. In our Polo clothing, one of the important things, as we took that license back, was really about creating a new and younger attitude, both in fit and appropriate price point as an entry point to our Polo brand and our Ralph Lauren portfolio. And the early response on that has been quite favorable. In our luxury product, Black Label really speaks to a much more contemporary viewpoint and customer and we're continually really refreshing and updating that product and that point of view and meeting with outstanding results. We see the same thing in RRL brand, and while it's really about heritage, it's about authenticity, which that younger consumer really relates to and we're seeing excellent momentum in our RRL brand. Our Denim & Supply brand speaks directly to the millennial consumer and that brand was introduced about 2 years ago. And it's growing at double-digit rates year-over-year for the past couple of years and we don't see any change in that. And we have another significant door rollout beginning this fall. So as I've said, the momentum there has been quite good. And in our accessory opportunity, we're also appealing to that younger customer. When you have the opportunity to see the new Polo Women's product, both the footwear and accessories, that we're selling and seeing some early success and we're now intent on expanding those categories in Polo Women's, have a very young, hip attitude. And I think you'll quickly see visually, as soon as you have an opportunity to see our new store opening, to really identify with why, in fact, we feel that our brands are so relevant to the younger consumer. Operator : The next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie. Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research : I guess, my question, I found it really hopeful that you said x the investment spending, your operating income would be growing at sort of a low-double-digit rate this year. It's really helpful for us to try to figure out kind of a longer-term earnings algorithm for this company, and given some of the investment spending, that's a little challenging. Do you think that, that low-double-digit rate x investment spending this year, is kind of consistent with what your outlook would be for the longer term, again stripping out the investment spending? Or do you think we could see even an accelerated rate with some of these initiatives, the things that you're basically investing in? And then also, as we get beyond this year, is it fair to say that your investment spending will be more focused on some of the kind of demand creation, sales-generation spending and less so on the kind of efficiency side. Sorry, I know that was a long question. Christopher H. Peterson: Okay, no problem. I guess I'd start by saying our investment spending buckets have different lives to them. So I think we had talked that this is the peak year of the investment in SAP. Although the SAP project will continue over multiple years because we'll finish the U.S. this year, we'll been in to the Europe implementation next year. This year we're both completing the U.S. and investing in Europe. So year-over-year, that investment spend would be lower next year. On the flip side, the e-commerce replatforming investment that we're doing that we've just kicked off is a 2- to 3-year project in terms of investment spend before we convert to the new platform and that spending is likely to increase next year versus this year. So each of the investment, strategic investment areas, have a slightly different life. That being said, if you were to step back and look at the longer-term algorithm of what we're shooting for from a financial target standpoint, I think what we're shooting for is a high-single-digit revenue growth is what we would like to try to achieve. I said in the past that, given the macroeconomic situation in any given particular period of time, we're prepared for mid-single-digits, but I think we're shooting for high-single-digits. I also think that, over the sort of 3- to 5-year time horizon, we're shooting for operating margin to be higher than where we are today because we certainly think that we can drive leverage in the business through that type of revenue growth. It's not going to be a straight line in terms of how we get from where we are today to those targets over sort of a 3- or 5-year period because it's going to depend on the pace and the sequencing of the investment spending. That being said, we obviously have not given guidance for fiscal '16 and we'll plan to do that and give a more specific update on that in our normal guidance timing where we typically give sort of some initial view on the January call and then a more specific set of guidance on the May call. Operator : The next question comes from Faye Landes with Cowen and Company. Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : A couple of quick questions. First of all, this is just a housekeeping, but all of us have been -- I think, since all of us in the call have been chained to our desks for a while, so can you just tell us where we -- what stores already have Polo Women's so we can go see it? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. The stores that have Polo Women's are Short Hills in New Jersey. The East Hampton store has Polo Women's. And I think it's going to be coming over the next couple of weeks in a much broader assortment of stores. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: And of course, our Fifth Avenue store opens August 28. We have gotten early reads from our business in Japan where we opened in Isetan and in our own Omotesando store. We have early reads from Korea that are also quite favorable. And these are markets that have a very young, spirited customer and attitude. And if it resonates there, we're quite optimistic about how it will resonate throughout the world. So those are some of the early reads we've had. Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just first of all, could you tell us how much the preopening is for the big stores this quarter and this year and what we should think of going forward? And also just your comments about Denim & Supply, RRL, et cetera, imply that your other businesses -- or some of your other businesses are negative in the U.S., which, obviously, holistically, is not necessarily an issue. But how we should -- what are the facts there and how should we think about them? Christopher H. Peterson: The preopening costs, I think, we don't disclose at that level of detail. But what we have disclosed, for example, is the rent on the Fifth Avenue Polo store, which is $25 million a year. And so obviously, we're paying that rent without any revenue right now. We also have invested significantly in hiring staff, so that we're ready to open the store, which we're paying salaries to. We're spending significant money on fit-out and capital, some of which is on the balance sheet, some of which is expensed. So it's fair to say that the peak investment in that particular store is happening in the second quarter and there was significant investment in the first quarter. The same is true of the Lee Gardens flagship and the same is true of the step-up in the pace that we're doing of global store rollouts around the world. So that gives you a little bit of a flavor. I think we've said in the past that, if you look in total at the investment spending behind the company's strategic investments for this year, global infrastructure, marketing and advertising and global store development, the global store development piece of that was -- they were relatively evenly split between those 3s in terms of their impact on the operating margin. Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : In terms of what we should think of. [Audio Gap] years, I mean, you're going to keep building stores? Christopher H. Peterson: Say that again? Faye I. Landes - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : How should we think about this in the out years? Because you're going to keep building stores. I mean, is this a peak-y year? Christopher H. Peterson: Yes, I believe -- I think it will be a peak year for us because although we're going to keep building stores, once you have the preopening costs in the base financials, the year-over-year impact shouldn't be as great next year because we will have had peak -- we will have had just the preopening costs in the base for this year. And so if we maintain that level of -- the same level or consistent level of global retail development going forward, we won't have a year-over-year impact from preopening costs because it's already in the base once it's gotten into this year. And on the flip side, we should start to benefit from the revenue and the profitability from the accelerated pace of new store openings. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Faye, in response to your comment regarding Denim & Supply and RRL, as I was answering David's question regarding the relevance of our Ralph Lauren brands to younger consumers, I was very specifically highlighting some of the brand concepts that are directly appealing and some new characteristics about our brands that we have now added as I talked about Polo Women's and the new Polo clothing and so forth and more recent brands like Denim & Supply. But we had a season in spring/summer that outpaced the stores' results and with particular strengths in Polo; in our footwear business, which was spectacular; our accessory business, which is running up double-digits; and a nice Chaps season. So I think that never meant to imply that these were and these weren't, but just to give you a little broader view. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I had a question on gross margins. So as we look out this year and into next year, obviously this year you're up against a much easier comparison you were last year. But if you kind of break down the 3 main initiative shifts that you have, as you move from wholesale to retail, or at least strategically, you're trying to do that, from apparel to accessories and then also U.S. to non-U.S., could you talk a little bit about which of those you see as having the biggest impacts? Obviously, this quarter, you called out channel and geography. But could you just call -- talk a little bit about which of those has the biggest impacts over time? I would assume they should all be gross margin accretive, but maybe a little color there. Christopher H. Peterson: Yes, you're right. All 3 of those would have a tendency to be gross margin accretive because our retail segment operates at a higher gross margin than wholesale. Our international business operates at a higher gross margin than our U.S. business. And of course, the accessories category can be characterized with higher gross margins than the apparel category. And so as we're driving those initiatives, we do expect that. I think the reason we called out the retail -- or the channel mix, in particular this quarter, was because we had the retail segment in the first quarter growing substantially faster than the wholesale segment in the first quarter. So that was clearly the biggest driver in terms of mix impact in Q1. I think relative to this fiscal year, I think all 3 will be important contributors to gross margin. Probably, given where we're looking, I think that the retail segment growth relative to the wholesale segment growth will probably have, in this current fiscal year, the biggest impact out of those 3. But I expect all 3 to be important contributors to gross margin over the next several years. On the flip side, obviously, the retail segment also comes with higher SG&A than the wholesale segment, and so we're working very hard to globalize much of the company's infrastructure so that we can leverage scale from the revenue growth regardless of whether it comes from the retail or the wholesale segment. And that's part of the operational changes that we've made in management to try to leverage more capability on a global basis that can apply omni-channel. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Just a couple of follow-ups, one on the gross margin, understanding that mix shift. But just curious in terms of what you're seeing from a markdown perspective, either from your retail partners or in your own stores during the quarter. Was that, in part, an offset to the strength you saw from the geographies and the channel shift? And then what is your guidance contemplating for Q2 and the full year in terms of gross margin? And then, just secondly, as it relates to Europe, I mean, clearly, a very strong region for you guys. Have you seen anything in terms of the early spring 2015 order book start to build? Christopher H. Peterson: So on the markdowns, actually our gross margin for the first quarter came in a little better than we expected when we gave guidance in May. So we really didn't see any year-over-year impact in our business from incremental markdowns versus the year ago period. It was a more promotional environment, but we are able to weather through that without a significant impact on our gross margins. If you look at the consolidated gross margin of the company during the first quarter, obviously, the gross margin was up and it would have been up even more than what was reported if it wasn't for foreign currency impact on European inventory purchases where we have a hedging program in place that we had a gain in that year ago period. So that sort of answers, I think, the first question. On the second quarter and full year in terms of gross margin, I think we expect -- we don't give guidance specifically on gross margin, but I expect our gross margin trends that we saw in the first quarter to roughly continue for the balance of the year. But I think we're looking at a year that has gross margin improvement throughout the balance of the year, relatively consistent with the first quarter. And then in terms of the early spring order books from wholesale, from Europe, in particular, I think Europe, we were very encouraged by the results from Europe in the first quarter and we talked a little bit about that. It really started to -- we've had continued strong growth in our retail stores over, really, the last year. We had a period where we pulled back on wholesale shipments and we were annualizing that, which we annualized last October-November type period. And so we started to see a return to growth in the wholesale channel in Europe and that trend started in the fourth quarter of last year, continued in the first quarter of this year and I think we expect that strength in the wholesale channel to continue for the balance of the year. And we're seeing that in the order books. Operator : The next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays. Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Could you speak a little bit to the margin profile of the Asian and e-commerce businesses given they're some of your highest growth segments. And also maybe just what the margin potential is for those longer term versus where they are today? Christopher H. Peterson: Yes, so I'll start on e-commerce. So e-commerce, we're at sort of a different place by region. So in the U.S., we have a very strong and well-developed e-commerce business that's at scale, that has margins in the U.S. e-commerce business that are at or above the balance of our U.S. business. So in the U.S., when -- if a consumer moves from a brick-and-mortar sale to an e-commerce sale, it is a good thing for us from a profitability standpoint. In Europe, because we started it later in Europe on e-commerce, we're just getting to scale. So this is the first year in e-commerce that we're going to turn from being in investment mode to being in profitability. And so as the scale builds in Europe, which we're seeing very strong trends, we expect the profitability in Europe e-commerce to increase significantly as that business begins to scale. And in Asia where we've just launched e-commerce for the first about a year or 2 ago, we started with Japan and then we came with Korea and we're working on Greater China and Southeast Asia, we're still in investment mode. So we're still not profitable, but it's because we're investing in getting the business up and running and we certainly expect, over time, that business to have a strong margin profile. Operator : The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I was wondering if we can talk a little bit about the pushout of shipments into 2Q. How much did that hold back the wholesale revenue growth in the first quarter? Christopher H. Peterson: I think it was a relatively minor amount. I think when we gave guidance at the beginning of the quarter, we thought that wholesale revenues, overall, would be relatively flat. And I think what we reported was down about 4%. And so I think the primary driver of that difference was in the wholesale receipt plans, particularly related to the summer and fall shipments where some of the shipments moved from the first quarter to the second quarter. So I think that was really the driver of that change, if you will. Operator : The final question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I saw the Polo Women's in East Hampton, I think it looks great. Store was busy. Could you go over the door count, Denim & Supply, this year from -- versus last year, owned stores and wholesale? And then is there an opportunity to accelerate the growth of Club Monaco stores? Christopher H. Peterson: Yes, so Denim & Supply, we've opened a number of doors around the world. I think we have 10 to 15 stores. We have 2 in the U.S. We have a number in Asia and a number in Europe. And I think what we're doing with Denim & Supply is we're working on optimizing the merchandising and assortment plans of those retail formats in a way that gives us confidence to accelerate the pace of further store rollouts. We're still very early in the Denim & Supply brand. I think we've launched the Denim & Supply brand 2 or 3 years ago. We're encouraged by the progress that we're seeing from the stores that we've opened to date. But we want to optimize, given that we've got 10 or 15 open, before we really accelerate. And then on Club Monaco, we have accelerated the pace of store openings. And so if you look at Club Monaco, I think that, not only with the Fifth Avenue flagship in Manhattan, some of the refurbishments of some of the other stores, but we're opening a significant pace of stores in Asia as well. We have 2 new stores that are about to open in London, one in Sloane Square, one in Redchurch that we're very excited about that we'll open in the next few months. And so that business is really resonating with the consumer. And we see an opportunity there to go a little faster. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: It's actually our largest business in China with license partners who accelerated another 20 stores this year and have plans for even greater growth next year as it's one of their top performing brands within their portfolio. I believe, it's the top brand -- performing brand. So thank you for your continued interest in the company. And we're, as you can see, working on many exciting initiatives. And there's a lot of important progress planned over our next few months and we look forward to updating you on that. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead. James Hurley : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of the quarter and comment on our broader strategic initiative. Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial perspective on the second quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of the year. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions, which we ask that you please limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The better-than-expected second quarter results we are reporting today demonstrate the progress we continue to make on each of our core strategic growth objectives. Revenue growth of 4% included sustained double-digit expansion for our international and our worldwide e-commerce businesses, as well as the successful launch of our newest brand, Polo for women. Diluted EPS of $2.25 was better than we anticipated, largely due to the disciplined operational management of our teams around the world. We are especially proud of these results in light of the challenging global operating environment during the quarter. The U.S. dollar strengthened against several major currencies, and geopolitical tensions escalated in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Collectively, these events had a negative impact on global tourism, and in certain instances, have also weighed on local customer demand. The highlight of our second quarter was, of course, the global introduction of Polo for women. This natural complement to our iconic Polo men's lines allows us to present the brand to consumers at retail in an even more powerful way. The launch of Polo for women coincided with the opening of our first Polo flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, but the voice and the impact of the brand was felt around the world, and the product message amplified by nearly 400 new Polo women's shops. We kicked off fashion week in New York with a groundbreaking 4D fashion show in Central Park, featuring the Spring 2015 Women's Polo collection. Staged over 3 consecutive nights, the show was a holographic, cinematic runway experience projected onto a 60-foot wall of water that was unlike anything the industry or the consumer has seen before. Thanks to the impact of the event itself and the global reach of RalphLauren.com, the show has achieved nearly 120 million social media impressions and over 2 billion media impressions to date. The high awareness, recognition and appeal of Polo has translated seamlessly to the women's offering, and the response has been terrific. The product is outstanding, the assortment is distinctive, and we believe that Polo for women fills a whitespace in the market around the world. We've spoken in the past about the creation of a global merchandising organization and the consistency of assortment and presentation around the world speaks to this relatively new team's remarkable results. I'd like to recognize the hard work of our design, merchandising, supply chain, retail, visual presentation, advertising, marketing and public relations teams for their extraordinary contributions to this important launch. For those of you who may not have yet had a chance to see the new Fifth Avenue Polo flagship, I encourage you to do so. Our team has done a spectacular job and the store is the perfect stage on which the depth and impact of the Polo brand story comes to life. The store brings brand heritage, lifestyle sensibility and product innovation together in a way that both clearly defines the Polo women's offering and perfectly complements the men's offering. The fits, fabrications and fashion elements of the women's and men's line are resonating strongly with the younger customer our associates see in the store. Speaking to the global appeal of the Polo brand, 40% of the store sales to date have been to foreign customers. In addition to the Fifth Avenue flagship, we have opened 20 stores in the first half of the year, and are on track to achieve our accelerated store development plans across our portfolio. We opened a Polo store in Shaw Centre in Singapore, and this is just the starting point, as we will be expanding Polo thoughtfully over the next few years, with a store in Las Vegas that opened this week, another in Houston set to open for the holiday season and a flagship on Regent Street in London in the first half of 2016. We have also opened a spectacular Ralph Lauren luxury flagship in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay Lee Gardens shopping district. This 20,000 square-foot store showcases our full range of women's and men's apparel, an exceptional presentation of accessories and footwear, a watch and fine jewelry salon, a beautiful collection of decorative accessories and gifts from our home collection, and a special vintage offering. Our expanding retail presence in Asia not only has a positive impact on our business, but also on our brand positioning with this consumer, both in the region and in other markets where they encounter our brand when they travel. Our Club Monaco business continues to grow in major markets as well. During the quarter, we opened 2 Club Monaco stores in London, as well as a recently renovated and expanded location in Boston's Prudential Center, with additional stores opening in Miami and Montr\u00e9al later this year. The company plans to open an additional 20 to 25 stores in total across the portfolio over the next several months. And based on this accelerated store development activity, we expect to achieve a higher level of retail sales growth in the second half of the year. We are also on track with the increased investments in advertising and marketing that were planned for the year, including more digital, print and social media around the world for both Polo and the Ralph Lauren brands. We expect these investments to support accelerated revenue growth in the back half of the year as well. Speaking for a moment to the season that's upon us, I'm pleased to share that our fall merchandise assortments have been well received across product categories and distribution channels around the world. This is evidenced by strong sales boosts at wholesale accounts and improved conversion in our own stores. We have seen momentum with our luxury collections in men's Purple Label, Women's Collection and RRL, as well as strong performance for our Polo, Lauren and Denim & Supply brands. Now I'd speak briefly about our next exciting endeavor, the global launch of Polo Sport. Polo Sport will be the next evolution of authentic modern activewear. As in everything we do, this line will unite the highest standards of quality and construction with our iconic approach to design, resulting in assortments that will take the consumer from field to street with workout essentials and sports apparel that ideally suit today's active lifestyle. The Polo brand has always reflected an active spirit and sensibility, and our company is proud to be associated with some of the world's most admired sporting events and championships in the worlds of tennis, golf, polo and of course, the Olympics. The strong consumer response to these partnerships and products affirms our belief that our brand's credibility and potential in the active space is unique and powerful. The brand's introduction will focus on men's apparel, with our first delivery for fall '15 season. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a tremendous rate, and we believe there is a significant long-term market share opportunity for Polo. Our better-than-expected results for the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 demonstrates the strength of our brand and the resilience of our diversified operating model, both of which allow us to make substantial investments in our longer-term growth objectives. As Ralph said in this morning's press release, our sustained focus on growing our international presence, extending our global retail reach and innovating with new products, has always served us well. I do want to mention some of the macroeconomic pressures facing our industry. As you know, growth has slowed for many of the world's largest economies, and we are closely monitoring both the global operating environment and the consumer reaction. We have set the bar high with respect to our sales plans for the year and believe in the strength of our rigorous planning process and our proven ability to carefully navigate through these kinds of challenges. We have confidence in our product and marketing strategies, and the sophistication of our global supply chain and merchandising organization enables us to read and react to changes in market dynamics better than ever before. Our unwavering commitment to the quality of our product, the integrity of our brand and the unique value proposition they provide will be our competitive advantage for the upcoming holiday season. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Christopher H. Peterson: Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 4% to $2 billion in the second quarter. Growth was led by the retail segment, driven by our direct-to-consumer strategy. Every geographic region grew in the quarter, with the international business up double digits. Adjusting for the incremental headwind from foreign exchange since early August, revenue growth was closer to 5%. Gross profit margin of 56.8% was 20 basis points above the prior year period due to favorable channel and geographic mix. Operating margin of 14.4% was 100 basis points below the prior year, and was significantly better than the outlook we provided in August due to strong and proactive operational management throughout the organization and a shift in the timing of certain expenses into the back half of the year. The operating margin decline was entirely attributable to incremental investments in new store openings, marketing and infrastructure projects. Net income of $201 million was modestly below the prior year. Net income per diluted share rose 1% to $2.25 due to a reduction in diluted share count as the company continues to return capital to shareholders through its share repurchase program. Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues of $943 million were 2% above the prior year, reflecting growth in all geographic regions. Wholesale operating margin of 26.2% was in line with the prior year, as improved profitability for underlying operations was offset by incremental investments in advertising and marketing. Retail sales rose 7% to $1 billion. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and included double-digit growth for both the international retail business and global e-commerce operations. Comparable store sales increased 1% during the quarter, supported by strong e-commerce performance and improved conversion at brick-and-mortar stores, which continued to experience challenging traffic trends. Retail operating margin was 13.6%, 80 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting costs associated with the company's global store and e-commerce development efforts, in addition to increased investments in advertising and marketing. Excluding those incremental investments, retail profitability improved from the prior year's level on strong international performance. Licensing revenues and operating income each rose 2% in the second quarter, due to higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren products. Consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings. We spent approximately $91 million on capital expenditures in the second quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. The company repurchased about 413,000 shares of its common stock, utilizing $70 million of its authorization and bringing year-to-date repurchase activity to $250 million. At the end of the quarter, $330 million remained available for future buybacks and we had $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. As we mentioned in August, we recently established the company's first commercial paper program and had $210 million of notes outstanding at the end of the quarter. We believe this is an attractive financing vehicle, since the cost to borrow is currently about 20 to 30 basis points. We are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results, both in terms of financial performance and progress on all of our key growth initiatives. We achieved our sales objectives and delivered better-than-expected profitability, despite a challenging operating environment. The team's skill balancing near-term market realities and our commitment to our long-range goals is a defining characteristic of our organization. Now let me turn to the fiscal year. Our fiscal 2015 plan calls for incremental investment in 3 key areas. The first is expanding our global store network, including important flagship projects. The second is strengthening our infrastructure, including implementing SAP and upgrading our e-commerce platform. And the third is increased advertising and marketing to support exciting new initiatives, such as the launch of Women's Polo, the opening of the Ralph Lauren Hong Kong flagship store and other high-profile store openings. Jacki talked about the progress on new stores and marketing initiatives. I would like to spend some time on our infrastructure projects. We've made very good progress and are on track with our plans for the year. Our global design, merchandising and sourcing operations have now fully transitioned to SAP, as has most of the North America wholesale business. We expect to complete the North America wholesale transition over the next several months. Based on the successful results to date, we recently kicked off the project for Europe, which we plan to complete over the next 18 months. We expect the SAP project to lead to both revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities over time as the project is fully implemented. We are also making excellent progress on a multiyear project to upgrade our global e-commerce platform. Today, we work with a single partner who manages the front end of our e-commerce sites. That front end includes our core commerce, content management and order management functionality. We handle the back end, essentially fulfillment, distribution and customer care, ourselves. Over the next 2 to 3 years, we're working toward assuming more direct control of that front end. This will allow us to significantly improve the consumer shopping experience, enable omnichannel capabilities and reduce cost versus our current structure. To do this, we recently completed a vendor evaluation process and have now selected the software providers we'll use for our core commerce, content management and order management functions, as well as a systems integration consultant. We're investing in new talent and capabilities so we can manage application development and systems integration in-house going forward. This will enable us to be far more nimble in responses -- and responsive to changes in technology and consumer behavior, allowing us to deliver a best-in-class customer experience that is uniquely Ralph Lauren. It's an exciting evolution and a critical investment, considering the growing importance of e-commerce worldwide. We expect a strong return on investment for this project and will provide more quantitative perspective once we have completed the fiscal 2016 budget process. Now I'd like to turn to the outlook for fiscal '15. On a constant dollar basis, we are maintaining our outlook for the year. That being said, foreign exchange rates have become a substantial headwind over the last 3 months. As a result, we now expect reported revenue growth of 5% to 7% for fiscal 2015, which reflects about 100 basis point negative impact from FX that is concentrated in the second half of the year. The full year fiscal 2015 operating margin is still estimated to be approximately 75 to 125 basis points below fiscal 2014's level, attributable to accelerated investment in our strategic growth initiatives. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect operating margin to be at the mid to low end of that range since our unallocated corporate costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. The full year tax rate is estimated at 30%. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect consolidated net revenues to increase by 3% to 5%, led by retail segment growth and including a 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange rates. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 100 to 150 basis points below the prior year period, due to higher cost of goods and incremental investments in the company's strategic growth initiatives. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. Our priorities are clear, and we have both the talent and the financial strength to attain them. The company has a long-standing track record of success in executing its strategies. We are excited about what we expect to achieve over the next several years as we continue to focus our capital and managerial resources on the most compelling long-term opportunities. As Ralph said in this morning's press release, we believe the investments we are making today will create significant value for our shareholders over the long term. At this point, we'd like to open the call up for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask a broader question around the broader retail strategy and what's going on in that piece of the business. And if you look back over the last several quarters, it's kind of been trending around a low single digit flattish comp sometimes. But I know you've got a lot of new retail rollout plans, the new Polo store on Fifth Avenue, and you had some pretty significant openings recently. Maybe you can give -- put this in context of how you expect the retail business to unfold over time and perhaps even an update on how some of the new stores in China and on Fifth Avenue and Singapore are doing to date would be helpful. Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. Thanks, Omar. Let me start with the Fifth Avenue store. So I think the response to the Fifth Avenue Polo store, which has been open about 1.5 months, has really been excellent, with broad-based acceptance of icons and fashion pieces. Interestingly, the Women's Polo business is representing about half of the sales of that store, which we are very encouraged by, because we think that the Women's Polo launch gives us another leg to the stool for the Polo retail strategy, and we're seeing strong response to that product. We're also seeing, as Jacki mentioned, about 40% of the sales go to foreign tourists in that store. And so we're seeing a strong resonance of Polo product with the foreign tourist. And the other interesting point I would say on that is that the #1 tourist shopper now in the United States is the Chinese, which we also think is encouraging, given the size of the Chinese consumer in the global market. We are very underpenetrated in China. And as you know, a lot of our retail strategy focuses on getting a broader penetration in international markets where we're -- that are more whitespace for us. And so we're excited to see the strong product acceptance among the Chinese consumer. More broadly, on the Polo store strategies, I think it's still a little bit early days. We've just launched the Polo Women's line. What we're seeing on the Polo Women's line is that the AUR, or the average unit retail price, on Women's Polo is about 40% lower than Blue Label, which we discontinued. But what we're seeing initially is that the unit velocity is dramatically higher. And so we expect the sales volume for Polo for women to far outpace that of the women's Blue Label line as we go forward. And we're seeing early good signs of that as we go along. We've only got about 5 directly operated Polo stores opened at this point, but we have a significant -- significantly greater number planned over the next 6 to 12 months, and we'll continue to learn as we open those. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got a question for Chris regarding SAP. Wanted to see, given your experience in prior SAP implementations, just how you think about this in greater detail over the long term? You spoke to it a little bit in the early part of your call, but could you address maybe how this impacts your gross margins and SG&A efficiency longer term? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So I think we're through the point where we've implemented SAP, and I think we've done a very good job of not dropping the ball from the implementation of SAP. So the transactional systems, the data conversion rates, the ability of the system to operate at scale, we feel highly confident in at this point. I think the next phase of the journey is beginning to realize some of the financial benefits. One of the things that we're very excited about is the -- what SAP is going to enable in terms of allowing us to operate on a more global basis. So for the first time, now, recently, in the last month or 2, we now have visibility to the number of SKUs that we're creating around the world and the SKU overlap because we now have common style numbers. And we believe we have a significant opportunity through our global merchandising organization to drive greater brand consistency around the world by improving the SKU -- by rationalizing our SKU base as we go forward. If you think about that rationalization of the SKU base, that has significant margin and revenue improvement opportunities for us, because what it will allow us to do is focus our design and merchandising efforts on the SKUs that we believe are the highest potential sellers. It allows us to manufacture at a higher scale per SKU. It allows us to reduce inventory going forward. It should allow us to have lower markdown rates, and it should allow us to market more -- in a more common way around the world. And so we're very excited about the prospects that the SAP system will enable. Now, it will take time to fully flush through our system. The first season that we're working on for SKU reduction is fall of 2015 because we tend to design 9 months out. So we're expecting to see initial benefits toward the back half of next fiscal year, and we expect the benefits to grow from that point. Operator : The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I wondered if you could clarify, Chris, your commentary in the outlook of higher cost of goods in Q3. Is that sequentially going to be higher from what we saw in Q2? And how should we think about that going into Q4? And just as a longer-term part of the question, can you update us on any refinements in the supply chain that you are working on that can ease some of the rising costs we're seeing over the longer term? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So I think on the higher cost of goods, I think this is a reflection of some of the investments that we're making in the season to move some of the production into Italy for some of our more luxury-oriented lines, invest more in the product quality, as well as -- which we believe is important to elevate the product. And that's really what we're talking about in terms of higher cost of goods that we expect in the third quarter. There also is a piece in the third quarter of product mix that we expect to impact the gross margin a little bit in the third quarter. But I don't view this as a sustainable trend. I view this as sort of a -- more of a one-off, so to speak. But we thought, given that we saw that trend, that we should mention it to The Street on the call so that it wasn't a surprise after the fact. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: And regarding the supply chain, what we have recently done is taken our manufacturing, sourcing and supply chain distribution organizations and consolidated that under a single leadership. And what we're seeing is that there is now a seamless view from start of manufacturing through delivery of our customers. And what we are working on and seeing quickly is that there are some important benefits by that close-tied relationship from start to finish, from factory to delivery to our stores and our customers. And we're just beginning to identify and recognize those opportunities. Operator : The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to follow-up on your full year guidance, your 3Q guidance and what that implies for 4Q as it relates to revenue. The pace of revenue growth in the fourth quarter, how much of that is a function of your store openings? And any visibility you have as far as what your forward order book might look like for the spring season, particularly in light of all the pressure we're seeing retailers feel right now. Christopher H. Peterson: Yes. So I think we've got very good visibility to our bookings through the balance of the year. And I think it's that visibility that we have in our bookings through the balance of the year, coupled with the accelerated pace of new store openings, that's factored into our guidance of accelerating revenue growth in the back half of the year, and in particular in the fourth quarter. Of course, the retail segment is a little bit more volatile depending on consumer traffic patterns, macroeconomic trends and consumer spending patterns. And so we're staying very close to that and monitoring it in a read-and-react fashion. But I think you've hit it right, which is the visibility we have in the wholesale bookings, which is pretty good at this point, coupled with the accelerated pace of retail store openings, is what's factored into our guidance for the balance of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on how you're thinking about the development of your supply chain when it comes to lead times. One of the things we've been thinking about is faster lead times becoming a responsibility for every vendor. Could you talk about what you're doing in that regard? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So I think one of the things we're looking at is our cycle time. And I think it's what Jacki meant -- talked about when she was talking about the combination of our global manufacturing and sourcing group with our supply chain group. By putting those 2 groups together, we're taking an end-to-end look at the time from design to the products being on the floor in the store. And in some cases, our current cycle time makes sense because it's optimized for cost and responsiveness to the consumer demand. In other cases, we believe that there could be an opportunity to accelerate cycle time so that we're more responsive to consumer demand and we can read and react on a faster basis. And I think one of the benefits that SAP is going to give us is even better visibility into those types of decisions going forward. So it's early days, because we've just combined these organizations and we're just in the middle of the SAP implementation. But it's certainly something that we are looking at actively. And we're not looking at it on a one-size-fits-all basis. We're looking at it very much on a product category basis. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Christian, also let me add that the SKU count initiative and the dramatic reduction that we're looking at there also, we believe, combines to give us tremendous agility. And in terms of what we're managing and how our teams are managing it broadly from design through delivery, and that would be also an important outcome of that initiative. Operator : The next question comes from Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Could you give a little bit more color on the geographical basis on your retail comp, international versus U.S.? And then in the U.S., maybe a little bit more color on how outlets did relative to full price. Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So we saw, on a comp basis in our retail business that internationally, we -- our comps were up low to mid single-digits. In the international business, we had double-digit comp growth in the e-commerce business in the quarter. In the U.S. business, the comps were relatively flat. And the channel that continued to experience the most challenge was the U.S. factory outlet business, where traffic to the outlet channel in the U.S. continued to be down. We did see an improvement in conversion, in our case, in that channel, which muted some of that traffic decline in the outlet business. Interestingly, in the international outlet business, traffic was up, and our comp store sales growth was up in that channel outside the U.S. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I was wondering, Chris, you had talked earlier about -- you gave some color on the different expense buckets, and that was helpful. I guess, if we think about those in their totality, can you give a little color on maybe what the cadence of that might look like going forward? And then, kind of related to that, you talked about the launch of Polo Sport. Could you maybe just dig a little into that in terms of what we should expect there from the expense side as well? Christopher H. Peterson: So, on the expense side, I think that, as we mentioned a little bit earlier, I think the peak expense pressure from the SG&A cost of the new store investments, the marketing investments and the infrastructure investments was really in the second quarter that we're reporting today. That being said, the dollar impact, that's from a margin standpoint, the dollar impact is going to be a little bit higher in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but we expect that not to have as great a margin pressure because of the accelerated pace of revenue growth in the third and fourth quarter. And so that's sort of how we're looking at it playing out during the fiscal year. So we expect the SG&A pressure to moderate in the third and fourth quarter versus what we saw in the second quarter from the incremental investments. On Polo Sport, I think Jacki sort of touched on it. We were very excited about this initiative because we think it gets us into a very large, fast-growing part of the apparel business. Our first launch is going to be for fall of next year, so this is a fall of next year launch. And we're really focused at the launch on the Men's business and we're focused on launching in our stores, in e-commerce and in select department and specialty stores around the world. So more to come in terms of quantification of that opportunity as we get closer to the launch date. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : I guess I have a question for Jacki. I know millennials have been a group that you guys have been focused on, and it seems like the Polo Women's launch is definitely helping to tap into that. Did that change how you're thinking about Denim & Supply longer term? Would just love an update on how that brand has been trending at wholesale. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Interesting, it's -- we're finding that the Polo Women's product definitely has an appeal to the millennial customer. And it is evidenced, clearly, if you stand in Fifth Avenue and you watch the audience who is buying that product, which was an important target for us as a company. So we really believe and see that we are realizing that result sort of as we are observing the results. The Denim & Supply product is doing extraordinarily well, although it has a more narrow distribution in a few stores that we've opened to date. And then more broadly, in wholesale internationally and of course, in the U.S. with Macy's. So the results have been fantastic on the brand, and the -- the audience is similar, however, the expression of the products are very different. The Polo Women's product really speaks to the, sort of the young preppiness, but with a twist and a very relevant to today's trend for that customer. And Denim & Supply has a much more -- a bohemian style about it, much more of a freestyle. And so they're quite differentiated when you look at the product. Both doing well and both really hitting their target audience. Operator : The next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays. Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : With some concerns out there around Europe recently, I was wondering if you could maybe speak more in detail to that business, either how it's been trending recently or if there have been any recent changes by region? Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. So, I think we were very pleased with the performance we had in Europe in the quarter. Our revenue was up high single digits in Europe in the quarter. We had our retail business grew double digits, and our wholesale business was up low single digits. If you look within Europe, I think we continue to see strength in the U.K. and Northern Europe. But importantly, we've seen a stabilization in Southern Europe that's contributed to a return to fairly strong growth in that region. Operator : The next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Can you talk about what strategies you're planning to offset declining outlet traffic? And why do you think that the traffic continues to be tough? And then the follow-on to that, what posture you're taking in Macy's and other department stores with the continued price promotion focus. Christopher H. Peterson: Sure. I'll handle the outlet question. So from an outlet question, I think that what we're doing is a couple of things. Number one, we're focused on increasing and making our marketing investments more relevant and more targeted to that outlet shopper to try to have call-to-action advertising that drives traffic into the center and our stores in the center. And I think that is helping mitigate a little bit the traffic trend in the U.S. outlet channel, which I would differentiate from the international outlet channel. That being said, I think longer term, what we believe is that with the expansion of the e-commerce business, we believe some of those e-commerce shoppers are choosing to shop online rather than drive to the outlet. And so we do believe there is a cannibalization impact that's impacting the outlet channel. And we think that it's important for us to play in both channels, and it's important for us to focus on both driving traffic in both channels and improving conversion in both channels. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: We also believe that with the gas price reduction and the fact that it often takes an hour to drive to an outlet mall, that, that also will provide some relief to the channel and could be an important differentiator as we move forward. In terms of price promotion at the department stores, I guess I've been doing this so long that it doesn't feel like it's any different to me. We have navigated through this season after season, through -- with every customer. We work hard to stay out of the fray and to guide our results based on our performance and product. As I said, I think we're happy with where we are for the fall season and we feel very comfortable as we guide ourselves into holiday and spring that we are well set up for the right appeal of product to our customers. So as I said, I don't feel it's any different than it's ever been before. And I think that, as I said, we are confident in how we move into the holiday season. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Patel with Stephens. Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Just a question on China e-commerce. I think you're still in investment mode right now. Can you give us an update on where you are? I'm curious on how you're positioned to take advantage of the growing demand in that side of the world as consumers embrace your concepts. Christopher H. Peterson: Yes. So, we are early days on that. We just turned on in June of this year our Hong Kong e-commerce website that has ship to capability to a number of markets in Southeast Asia. We have not yet penetrated the Mainland China e-commerce business. We also, I would point out, just recently turned on social media in China as part of our increase in marketing and advertising spending this year, which we're very excited about. We are, of course, investigating how to approach and tackle the e-commerce business in Mainland China, given the size and growth of that business. But we have -- we're working through what we believe is the right business model, and we'll update you as we make decisions on that. Operator : The final question comes from Rick Snyder with Maxim Group. Rick L. Snyder - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division : You indicated in the first quarter that there was a revenue shift in wholesale to Q2 in the U.S. And I'm looking at the wholesale growth, and it's only up 1.6%. I think it's a net loss for the quarter. Can you just talk about that shift? And did it play out as you expected? Christopher H. Peterson: Yes. So, I think one of the challenges is that our financial quarters don't line up nicely to the seasons. And so what we tend to look at is the spring/summer season, and then we look at the fall/holiday season. And what our focus is on the wholesale channel is growing market share. And so as we looked at how we closed out the spring/summer season, which included Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year and Q2 of this year, our wholesale business globally grew faster than the wholesale channel, and we grew market share in the channel over that period. We believe that we have a very strong plan for fall/holiday, that we have confidence we'll continue to grow our market share in the channel. There can be quarterly shifts in timing of shipments related to that, that follow wholesale customer receipt plans, but we tend to be more focused on the season basis than on the quarter basis is how we look at it. James Hurley : Great. Thank you very much for calling in today and participating. Jackwyn L. Nemerov: Thank you. Christopher H. Peterson: Thank you very much, and we'll look forward to talking to you all again soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. James Hurley. Please go ahead. James Hurley : Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning\u2019s call includes Jacki Nemerov, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of the quarter and comment on our broader strategic initiative. Chris Peterson, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will provide operational and financial perspective on the third quarter, in addition to reviewing our outlook for the balance of the year. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. Now, I turn the call over to Jacki. Jacki Nemerov : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results we are reporting today demonstrate the disciplined operational management of our teams through a competitive holiday season and against the backdrop of an unusually volatile macro environment. The 3% constant currency revenue we achieved in the quarter was below our expectation, largely due to external forces. As the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen against several major currencies and geopolitical tensions remained elevated. There was a sustained negative impact on global tourism, and in certain instances, local customer demand. The U.S. market size was more competitive with greater promotional activity across all distribution channels. We gain share early in the holiday shopping period, which positioned us well as the environment became more competitive in the three weeks before Christmas. I\u2019m proud to report that we navigated these challenges in a brand appropriate way, controlling the controllable and delivering operating profitability at the high end of our outlook. We aggressively managed expenses even as we continue to invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. As both a company and the brand Ralph Lauren is always taken a long view and this quarter was no exception. Now let me turn to product highlights of the fall holiday season, and begin with our luxury brands. Both men\u2019s Purple Label and Women\u2019s Collection performed well in the quarter by challenging traffic trends in our retail stores. Not only to these lines represent the purest expression of Ralph\u2019s design vision, but they exemplify the quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that the true luxury customer appreciates. Sportswear and outerwear were particularly strong categories where our distinctive aesthetic proved especially compelling. As you know, we recently launched Polo for women, the high awareness and broad appeal of the Polo brand has translated well to the women\u2019s offering and customers around the world are embracing it. Momentum is growing with each new delivery as the distinct fashion sensibility of the brand continues to resonate with the younger customer across retail and wholesale channels. The distinctive lifestyle positioning and retail presentation of our Denim & Supply brand has created real differentiation in the marketplace. Its appeal among millennial\u2019s had led to a strong performance of both the foundational Denim component of the line as well as the more directional fashion elements. From a category perspective, dresses continued to be a standout performer across all of our distribution channels and we\u2019ve expanded the assortment to fully represent day cocktail and formal occasion needs. Handbags and footwear also experienced strong growth in the quarter with terrific consumer response to both iconic silhouettes and new styles. Finally, the distinctive point of view and emphasis on fashion drove strong growth for our Club Monaco brand across women\u2019s apparel, men\u2019s apparel and footwear. I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region since there were some very interesting differences during the quarter. Importantly, we achieved constant currency revenue growth in each of the three major operating regions of the Americas, Europe and Asia. This is despite lower sales to important tourist customers especially those from Russia and the Middle East, who have been most impacted by the volatility in currency and commodity market. International performance was especially strong, growing double-digits in current currency with greater China and Europe registering the strongest gains. This is encouraging not only in the contest to difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic condition. But also because growing our international revenue is one of our most important strategic objective and in the year-to-date period, international revenues represented one-third of our total revenues. Our European revenues rose double-digits in constant currency during the third quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and reflecting broad-based momentum throughout the region. Generally speaking, we continued to see the best trends in Northern Europe recovery in the southern part of the continent and more steady expansion in central Europe. We achieved high single-digit constant currency growth in Asia, led by our free standing store network, with trends varying by country. Sales in Japan were quite good and continued the momentum we had last quarter. Korean sales remained challenging for the apparel sector, especially in the department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Double-digit constant currency revenue growth in greater China largely reflects the investment we have made a new distribution. While Hong Kong was disrupted by prolonged political protests, we are encouraged by the performance of our recently opened Lee Gardens flagship. This is an important market for luxury brands and we believe the store appropriately positions the Ralph Lauren brand to this customer. We achieved modest growth in the Americas were lower customer traffic to brick-and-mortar stores was a formidable headwind. A planned shift in seasonal customer receipt plans for certain merchandise categories impacted our wholesale shipments during the quarter. Our North American e-commerce business grew at a double-digit rate in the third quarter and both our retail and wholesale channels. To expand on e-commerce, since that\u2019s another important area of strategic focus, our global e-commerce revenues grew 17% in the third quarter, supported by double-digit expansion in each region. Traffic to our e-commerce sites increased significantly, with over 40% growth in mobile traffic alone. We experienced equally strong momentum for our wholesale e-commerce business. We were well prepared for this year\u2019s kickoff to the holiday season during the Thanksgiving, Black Friday week, which now stands through the increasingly important cyber Monday. The strength of our retail e-commerce was due in part to a number of site enhancements we\u2019ve made over the last several months. These include more impactful visuals, redesigned product detail pages, enhanced quick-shop capabilities and a more streamline checkout process. We added preorder to capabilities for our women\u2019s collection line, which is an important feature for the luxury customer who wants to shop the runway. We\u2019ve also develop more robust omni-channel capabilities, leveraging technology to share inventory across our retail format. This enables us to enhance our customer service and maximize sales, while improving the productivity of our inventory. The investments we are making in e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities beautifully showcase the Ralph Lauren lifestyle, while offering the product focus and clear call to action that this customer expects. These efforts will be enhanced even further in the next two to three years with our new e-commerce platform. This investment will ensure that ralphlauren.com is the most robust and expansive expression of the Ralph Lauren brand, and will support what we believe can be a billion dollars in sales. I\u2019d also like to highlight the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. Over the years, our sourcing and logistics teams have navigated through not only the growing scope of our global operations across regions, channels and product categories, but also dynamic changes in input cost and all the while meeting the company\u2019s extremely high standards of quality and innovation. The benefits of our decision to design a global supply chain organization were especially apparent during the third quarter as we contended with the West Coast port situation. The end-to-end visibility from product sourcing to customer delivery enabled our team to develop and execute robust contingency plans, minimizing risk, controlling costs, and maintaining business continuity. I\u2019m delighted to report that our service levels to customers have been maintained despite the 3 to 10 day extended transit times that the disruption has created for the industry and I want to extend my thanks to this remarkable team for their extraordinary work. The global supply chain teams also made excellent progress on a number of critical strategic initiative design to continuously improve our productivity. Some of the most compelling areas of opportunity have come from improved supply and demand visibility. This is allowed us to better leverage our volume growth and to be more disciplined with respect to managing product minimum, reducing product lead times and consolidating shipments. We believe that they are still more opportunity and this will continue to remain an area of focus. The unexpected challenges we faced in the third quarter followed better than expected sales and profit trends in the first half of the year. We are proud of our progress against the company\u2019s long-term growth objectives and with our ability to consistently invest in these areas while still executing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards. We are able to do this as a result of the strategic diversity of our operating model, the power of our brand portfolio, the desirability of our products, and the high level of operational control we have over business. In November, I mentioned the next exciting endeavor for our Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport, beginning with the introduction of men\u2019s and boy\u2019s for the fall \u201815 season. Across the globe, the feedback on this product has been strong and seen as a natural fit with the spirit and sensibility of Polo. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate and we believe there is a significant long-term market share opportunity for Polo. I also want to mention the most delicious extension of our Polo brand, our new restaurant in New York. The Polo bar officially opened on January 9th and the response has been sensational. From the food to the service to the decor, Ralph has brought something special and unique to the Manhattan dining scene and we are overwhelmed by the enthusiasm people have to experience the brand in this way. Based on the continued uncertainty of the global macroeconomic environment, we are planning the fourth quarter next year cautiously and responsibly. This included a comprehensive look at our operating model. Chris will take you through some of our plans to move to a global brand management structure with new systems and processes to support the stronger sales and profit growth we expect over the next five years. As challenging of the macro environment is, I believe we are operating from a position of strength and that our company is mobilized to manage through it. We have a long-term plan; a clear strategic roadmap to help us realized that plan, the managerial talent to navigate that roadmap and $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet to support our efforts. The board shares our confidence in both our future growth plans and our financial condition as evidenced by increase in the quarterly dividend payment that was announced today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris. Chris Peterson : Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start with a brief recap of the quarter. Consolidated net revenues rose 1% to $2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusting for FX headwinds, revenues increased 3%, which was achieved on top of a 9% gain on the prior year period, led by the retail segment and driven by our strategic focus on e-commerce and new store development. Every geographic region grew on constant currency during the quarter with the international business up double-digits. Reported revenue actualized below our outlook of 3% to 5% growth, due to negative foreign exchange and weaker than expected trends at our retail stores, which were impacted by a decline in traffic, especially among important tourist customers and a more promotional holiday period in the U.S. Gross profit margin of 57% was a 120 basis points below the prior year period. We anticipated decline in gross profit margin was due to mix impacts, the more promotional U.S. marketplace and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operating margin of 15.5% was 110 basis points below the prior year, entirely attributable to the lower gross profit margin. This was at the high end of the outlook with provided in November, due to strong and proactive expense management throughout the organization and despite incremental investments and new store openings, marketing and infrastructure projects. Net income of $215 million was 9% below the prior year, and net income per diluted share decline 6% to $2.41 million. Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues increased 2% in constant currency, which was achieved on top of 14% gain in the prior year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $837 million or in line with the prior year. Growth in European whole shipments was offset by lower shipments in the Americas due to the cadence of seasonal receipt plans and unfavorable foreign exchange. Wholesale operating margin of 24.7% was 120 basis points below the prior year due to product mix impacts. Retail sales rose 5% in constant currency and were up 2% to $1.1 billion on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and included double-digit growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were in line with the prior year in constant currency and declined 2% on a reported basis, due to foreign exchange. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance and positive growth internationally that was offset by a decline in comps in the Americas, which continue to experience challenging traffic trends at brick-and mortar stores. Retail operating margin was 16.9%, 260 basis points below the prior year period, reflecting the more promotional U.S. marketplace and cost associated with the company\u2019s global store and e-commerce development efforts. Licensing revenues increased 6% and operating margin rose 7% in the third quarter, due to higher royalties from increase sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren products around the world. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth for existing operations and new store openings. We spent approximately $124 million on capital expenditures in the third quarter, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. Company also repurchased about 550,000 shares of its common stock, utilizing $100 million of its authorization and bringing year-to-date repurchased activity to $350 million. At the end of the quarter $230 million remained available for future buybacks, and we have $1.4 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. At this point, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the balance of the year and provide some preliminary perspective on fiscal \u201816. For the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to increase at a mid-single digit rate in constant currency, which is an acceleration from the third quarter and year-to-date results. Based on current foreign exchange rates, FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 550 basis points. Operating margin for the fourth quarter\u2019s expected to be 250 to 300 basis points below the prior year with relatively equal pressure on gross margin and operating expenses. The decline in operating margin reflects unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, investments and the company\u2019s strategic growth objectives and a cautious view of the global environment, which we believe this prudent of this time. Fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 31% to 32%. For the full year fiscal \u201815 period revenues are expected to increase about 4% in constant currency and we now anticipate of 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. This compares to our prior outlook of 5% to 7%. The full year fiscal \u201915 operating margin is now estimated to be 170 to 190 basis points below the prior year\u2019s level compares to a prior expectation of a 100 to 125 basis points decline. The change in operating margin guidance is driven by the lower sales outlook and foreign exchange. As a remainder, the primary drivers of the year-over-year contraction in operating margin are the incremental investments for making to expand our global store network strengthen the company\u2019s infrastructure and increased advertising and marketing. The fiscal 2015 tax rate continues to be estimated at 30%. If we look to the future, we remained committed to investing in the growth initiatives that we believe we\u2019ll provide us with a more robust platform for future sales and profit growth. While we have not yet completed our fiscal 2016 budget, I want to provide some qualitative insight into how we are approaching next fiscal year. The context in which we are operating has changed. In addition to political and economic challenges around the world, we are experiencing significant headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Based on current exchange rates, FX will have about a 550 basis point negative impact on fiscal \u201916 revenue growth. The combination of translational and transactional currency effects is estimated to reduce our full year operating income by approximately $185 million. This is the most significant currency impact the company has experienced in the fiscal year. To deal with these external realities, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate their impact. First, we intend to raise prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation including Japan, Canada and Europe. Second, our supply chain organization is negotiating lower prices across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material cost and oil prices as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. Finally, we intend to reduce operating cost by restructuring the organization something I\u2019ll come back to you later. With that as a backdrop, we are currently planning mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth in fiscal \u201816 supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we\u2019ve invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new store development and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to expanded square footage in continued momentum in e-commerce. On a constant dollar basis, we expect operating margin from continuing operations to improve from fiscal 2015 level due to gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We intend to reinvest that improvement in two main areas, the build out of the new global e-commerce platform and global store development including the renovation of several existing stores. Over the next two years, we expect to re-merchandize several existing locations to our Ralph Lauren or Polo concepts in order to refine brand positioning, streamline assortments and better service the customer. On a reported basis, we expect operating margin to be down due to the foreign exchange impact I mentioned earlier. We will provide more specifics on our fiscal \u201916 operating margin expectations in May after we completed the budget process. Let me now turn to the operating model change that Jacki referred to few minutes ago. For a number of reasons, we decided that the time was right to transform the way in which our organization is structured, how we design and manage our processes and how we make decisions. This is a significant change to position the company for stronger future performance. About 15 years ago, the company embarked on a long range plan to assume direct control over strategically important regions and merchandise categories. This began with the acquisition of the European business in 2000. Over the next decade, the company acquired more than a dozen previously licensed businesses. These actions allowed us to maximize the sales and profit potential of each of these businesses while elevating the presentation of the brands. The result however was a complex operating model. To address this, we first turned to infrastructure upgrading systems in order to integrate what was a highly fragmented channel and regional structure. Next, we began to globalize several critical corporate functions, such as finance, IT, supply chain and merchandizing. Today, we are taking the next step to simplify our operating model. Over the next several months, we will commence plans to move from a decentralized channel and regional structure to a fully integrated global brand-based organization structure. We have always believed that our brands are greatest assets and a significant competitive advantage. Our strength as a company stems from the vitality and desirability of our brands. In this new structure, we will create global brand groups that will not only define the strategy from the design and merchandising to retail concepts and marketing, but will also have accountability for financial performance around the world. Importantly, we will continue to have regional channel and functional teams, but not only provide critical expertise and insight to the global brand groups, but also operate the business on the day-to-day basis. We believe this will strengthen the connectivity from the design vision to the consumer impression and ensure greater clarity and consistency of brand expression. While each of our brands enjoys high awareness and regard today, we believe this new organization design will further enhance brand equity. We see this next step is a critical milestone to realizing our vision of operating as a truly global business, maximizing our growth potential and realizing significant operating efficiencies. Let me give just one example. Now that we have completed the SAP rollout across design in global manufacturing, we have visibility for the first time into our SKU development, adoption and performance. We now know that last year, we designed 130,000 SKUs across the company with the commonality rate by brand in like locations around the world that is very low. The new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to lower inventory levels, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings. Our goal once the new structure is fully implemented is to achieve over $100,000 in annual expense savings. Only a modest amount will be realized in fiscal \u201816 with more significant savings in fiscal \u201817 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring charge as a result of this reorganization and we are currently working through the details of the plan. We will provide more insight in May. We are very excited about the company\u2019s growth prospects. We are investing in the business and making the right strategic decisions in order to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns overtime. With that, we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks, good morning. Chris and Jacki, hoping you could elaborate little more on some of the organizational changes that you discussed this morning. The impetus behind them, maybe some more anecdotal ideas around where you can see benefits accrue over time, as you shift the organizational structure and then where you stand on the HR perspective, I believe in teams and people in place for a kind of brand centric global organization. More color on those would be really helpful. Thanks. Chris Peterson : Yeah, let me start, I think that a lot of the work that we\u2019ve done in the company over the last couple of years to globalize the company in terms of our systems, in terms of some of the functions that we move to a global basis, as really enabled us to take the next step. And so we think now is the right time because of a lot of this ground work that we\u2019ve laid over the past couple of years to really set the stage for the new organization model and we think that this creates a platform for future sales and revenue growth acceleration, because what it\u2019s going to enable us to do is be more focused on a by brand basis and really integrate the work of design, merchandizing, marketing, retail store concepts around the world. And so if you think about the way we\u2019re operating today, because of the way we\u2019ve acquired licenses, we\u2019re really operating with many different groups around the world that are performing similar activities. And we believe that this new construct will allow us to enhance the brand clarity and consistency around the world, while driving operating efficiencies at the same time. In terms of where we are from an HR standpoint, I think as we alluded to prepared remarks, this is going to require a detailed design work which we\u2019re in the middle of and we expect to have much more specifics when we come back and talk on the May call on that basis. James Hurley : Next question? Lora we\u2019re ready for the next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti : Thanks, good morning guys. Chris, I was wondering if you could help us with a little more color on your comments on the operating margin outlook for fiscal \u201916 when you exclude FX. Chris Peterson : Yeah. So I guess I would say a couple of things. First, let me just describe the FX impact a little bit and then I\u2019ll come back to the underlying. So, I think as we mentioned we expect FX at current rates to have about a negative 550 basis point impact on the top-line. A lot of our cost structure is in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and Hong Kong dollars, because that\u2019s where we have our big standards of operation from an SG&A standpoint from overhead and of course a lot of our manufacturing base is in currencies that have not depreciated as much as the Euro, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. So when we look at the FX impact on the top-line of 5.5%, the flow through of that to the bottom-line is a little bit over 40% in terms of the impact that it has which is what leads to the $185 million headwind because our cost structure is not denominated in local currency. On the underlying basis, back to your question, I think that we expect our operating margin on the underlying basis to be up versus this year and that\u2019s because some of the investments that we\u2019ve been making in terms of our infrastructure, in terms of the retail store development and in terms of the increased marketing and advertising were seeing positive trends from those that are driving growth in operating margin on an underlying basis. The two headwinds that we have next year which we expect to offset the underlying increase in operating margin are the e-commerce platform, which will be a bigger investment next year than this year, but we believe strategically the right thing for us to do as we\u2019ve talked about in the past and the continuation of our retail store development effort particularly where we\u2019re looking to re-merchandize many of our stores from the world of Ralph Lauren concept into distinctive Ralph Lauren luxury stores or Polo stores, which we think are clearer to the consumer. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David Glick : Yes, thank you. Just a follow-up question on your America\u2019s business, I was just wondering if you can give us obviously the international business in constant currency was very strong, little bit of noise in North American wholesale. How do you think about in the sort of context of the new world as you describe and how do you think about the underlying growth potential on a near and intermediate long-term basis of your wholesale and retail businesses in U.S. in comparison to what continues to be strong performances in Europe and Asia. Chris Peterson : I think if you \u2013 if we look at the wholesale business, we believe the wholesale business which is largely focused in U.S. and Western Europe as a channel is likely to grow at a sort of a 0% to 2% rate. We believe we have opportunity to grow market share and we\u2019ve pretty consistently been growing market share in that channel if we look over the last 10 years and so we think we can grow a couple of points faster, which would position us at sort of a low to mid-single digit growth rate in the wholesale business going forward. The retail business we believe we can grow faster both driven by the e-commerce business where we had high teens growth in the current quarter and we think that the e-commerce business is going to continue to grow at an accelerated rate, which is why we are investing behind the e-commerce business and then when you go to the brick and mortar retail business, I think that \u2013 we think that the brick and mortar retail business, we had strong performance internationally and a little bit of a slowdown and performance in U.S. that was below our expectations primarily driven by traffic trends. We saw traffic trends in the quarter at the factory outlet channel that were down mid-single digits and that\u2019s what really affected us relative to the expectations we had going into the quarter. Jacki Nemerov : I think also that in the U.S., the third quarters interesting because what we saw was that we continued to take market share in the quarter even across all of our categories on that we blend and represent, that was \u2013 I think unique as certainly the backdrop of the quarter was more challenging around. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Kate McShane : Thank you, good morning. Chris, I just wondered if you could walk us through the revenue guidance that you have for the remainder of fiscal year 15, which you\u2019re guiding to be up mid-single-digits in constant currency, which is up against your toughest comp and would be the stronger sales growth of the year. What are the drivers of that and what are you basing your confidence on that this can be achieved in Q4? Chris Peterson : Yeah, so I think as we look at Q4, we think that we\u2019re planning the business prudently with a mid-single-digit constant dollar comp growth. We have good visibility in our wholesale business from a booking standpoint and we certainly expect the wholesale business in the fourth quarter to grow at a faster rate than what we saw in the third quarter and in the year-to-date period. From a retail standpoint, we are anticipating a bigger impact on retail primarily due to new store openings. So baked into our constant dollar comp guidance is not a big expectation for a constant dollar comp increase. It\u2019s more around the acceleration where we see in the wholesale business as well as the full impact of our retail store development activity and of course we\u2019re continuing to view the e-commerce is operating very successfully, which we have been doing. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Thanks, good morning, Chris. For the fiscal \u201816 outlook, I just had a question on that, I think it was a $185 million operating profit drag. Number one, is that on a fully unhedged basis and have you hedged any of your inventory that would delay that flow through? Number two, is any of that $185 million occurring in the fourth quarter? Or is that just a fiscal \u201816 number? And then lastly, how much visibility do you have to lower costs from cotton and energy and other items, offsetting some of that operating profit drag? Thanks. Chris Peterson : Yeah, okay. So we do hedge our inventory purchases, a portion of our inventory purchases and we typically hedge sort of six to nine months out. So we\u2019re not hedged for the full fiscal year next year and we\u2019re not hedged to the 100% rate. We typically hedge at sort of a 70% of our exposure rate. So there is a significant impact from currency in that guidance for next year that\u2019s inventory related, but there are also will be an additional flow through in the following year from the portion of inventory next year, where we do have a hedge on, if you think forward to fiscal \u201917. With regard to the fourth quarter, there certainly is a foreign exchange impact on the bottom-line and on the operating margin in the fourth quarter and in fact it\u2019s fairly significant. And the reason for that is that when you think about the flow through that I talked about earlier, if the FX drag on the top-line is flowing through next year to a little bit over 40% rate. We\u2019re also seeing a similar type of impact in the fourth quarter and with the 550 basis point drag from foreign exchange on the top-line in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s creating an operating margin pressure in the fourth quarter, which is a big part of the reason for our guidance change on operating margin, not just for the fourth quarter, but also for the fiscal year \u2013 the current fiscal year. And then on comp on raw material and oil cost, we have some visibility to that and so when we saw the drop in commodities and we saw the strength of the dollar and we saw the drop in oil prices. We immediately began working with the global manufacturing and supply chain teams, who have at this point gone over and met with the number of our manufactures in Asia and began the work on getting cost reduction. We don\u2019t have full visibility to the cost reduction that we\u2019re going to get, but we are certainly confident that we\u2019re going to get some cost reduction as part of this and that\u2019s part of the detailed work that we have and finalizing the budget ahead of us over the next couple of months. There is a timing lag in terms of when that flows through because typically the seasons that we\u2019re negotiating are six months out or so from the time that we began that negotiation process. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Buss : I was wondering if you could talk a bit about retail performance and what your expectations are going forward for outlets versus full price stores. Chris Peterson : Yeah, I think on the outlet business, we saw retail comps up in the international outlet business and so we\u2019re seeing sort of a tale of two different environments. In the international business, the outlet business continue to \u2013 we are able to continue to drive comp store sales gains and we\u2019re not seeing the traffic declines in the international outlet centers that we are in the U.S. and the U.S. I think the traffic declines that we\u2019re seeing to the center are putting more pressure on that business. It\u2019s still a large business and still a very profitable business for us, but we believe that with the growth of the e-commerce business which is become particularly large in the U.S. that\u2019s starting to cannibalize a little bit into that channel, also as some of the brick and mortar stores that are closer in to the urban areas have gotten more competitive on pricing it\u2019s reduced the consumer desire to drive to get to the outlet center. And so we\u2019re factoring that into our plans as we go forward because we expect that trend, although you can never predict but we certainly think the consumers going to continue to shop more and more on online and as that happens we think that\u2019s going to continue to put pressure on brick and mortar. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Evren Kopelman : Thank you. Good morning. Can you give a little bit more color around your comments about the promotional environment in the U.S. maybe more by channel what you saw at department stores versus the outlet channel, where you saw the biggest pressure and what do you expect going forward? Chris Peterson : Yeah, so I think what we saw was that as we enter \u2013 I think Jacki sort of talked about this in the prepared remarks. But as we enter the holiday season, we got off to a pretty strong start over the Thanksgiving period, the week before Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, and then we saw a little bit of a drop in sort of the consumer purchase behavior and that period between the Thanksgiving \u2013 the end of the Thanksgiving shopping period and the first couple of weeks of December. And as a result of that what we saw was that a lot of the competitors ratcheted up the promotional intensity in terms of trying to deal with the inventory that they had on the floor and so reacted to that not to ensure that we stayed competitive during the period and I think that\u2019s what we were alluding to in our commentary. And again, that was really a U.S. phenomenon, not so much international. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays. Joan Payson : Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the Polo women\u2019s business, how that\u2019s performing in retail stores compared to a point of sale at wholesale and also how it\u2019s doing internationally compared to domestically. Jacki Nemerov : Yes, the Polo women\u2019s business is off to a nice start. As you know, we started that business just this past fall. And we\u2019re seeing a strong response from that younger customer and on an overall basis we are seeing a nice reaction in the department stores. We\u2019re seeing a nice reaction in our retail stores and from an international basis, also a very strong reaction in the international markets in Europe and in Asia. I think that as any new brand is launched, there are opportunities to continue to build and perfect and as we are now receiving next season\u2019s merchandise and so forth, we\u2019re continuing to see those changes and an improvement consistently in the momentum of the brand. We really believe that it\u2019s unique and addresses a new audience and so I would say that we are pleased so far with the results, but more to do and more to build and develop. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff : Hi everyone, following on Joan\u2019s question, talk about, please, the performance of Lauren in U.S. department stores this year versus last year and how do you see it going forward? Jacki Nemerov : Our overall performance in the Lauren brand all of its categories which are obviously \u2013 we have a sportswear business and important dress business, footwear business and accessory business, multiple licensed businesses and the brand has been growing steadily over as you know many years. I think that we see opportunity in certain aspects of the business, certain businesses are on huge acceleration and other businesses have slowed slightly and we continue to work on a daily basis to be able to address that. The dress business is on fire. Lauren represents the number one dress brand in almost every department store. We\u2019ve had a phenomenal footwear season with accelerated growth in footwear. Our bag business is also building nicely and we had an excellent season in bags. Our sleepwear business, a lot of \u2013 our coat business also was spectacular for the season. So I think that it moves on a category by category basis, but overall strong growth in the brand. James Hurley : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Great, thank you, good morning. Just on the gross margin side, could you just help us aggregate that 120 basis point decline during the quarter? What was tied to the promotional environment versus FX versus mix shift and then, did you guys have to air freight more to work around the port issue. And then just in context with the gross margins, as we think about your guidance for 2016, you talked about constant currency gross margin being up. Just speak to the drivers there. Thank you. Chris Peterson : Yeah, so on the quarter on gross margin, really there were three things that impacted the 120 balance sheet. Certainly, currency had a significant impact as we mentioned the promotional U.S. marketplace and then we had a mix impact as well, and part of that was due to the cadence of our wholesale shipments. The cadence of our wholesale shipments in the quarter, we round up shipping more women\u2019s product in the third quarter than we did men\u2019s product in the third quarter from a growth rate standpoint and the men\u2019s business operates at a significantly higher gross margin for us than the women\u2019s business. And so we saw a mixed impact that was due to the men\u2019s versus women\u2019s growth mix. If you look at those three aspects, I would say that the three aspects were relatively equal in nature. There was not one that was overwhelming relative to the other aspects on gross margin during the quarter. We did have to air freight more product during the quarter. We also round up routing a lot of product via all-water routing. So we shipped it around the U.S. and received it in the East Coast ports. And what that did is Jacki eluded to was that allowed us to avoid some of the issues in the West Coast port situation, but it takes more time to ship it to the East Coast. So we then had to accelerate once the product was unloaded in the East Coast, receipt into our Greensboro distribution center and staffing our Greensboro distribution center to turn that inventory around faster. So we did see an impact from the West Coast port strike. But I would say that impact was relatively minor because of the strong management of our supply chain teams. And with regard to next year, on an underlying basis, we do believe gross margins going to be up as we gone through the initial stages of the budget process and I think there is a couple of reasons for that. One, as we expect the retail segment to grow faster than wholesale and of course our retail segment has higher gross margins than wholesale. Two, we expect the accessories business to grow at a faster rate than the balance of the business and that also tends to be a gross margin sweetener. And then third, at least in constant currency, the international business is projected to grow at a faster rate and of course we have higher gross margins in the international business than we do in the U.S. and so when you look at those three elements, I think all of that is driving us to underlying gross margin that\u2019s improving in next year\u2019s forecast versus this year. James Hurley : Thank you very much for attending and as always, we\u2019ll be available for follow-up calls. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2015 has been a year of solid accomplishments despite a challenging operating environment and substantial foreign-currency headwinds in the back half of the year. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations, driven by strong demand in North America wholesale and global e-commerce. While we continue to experience the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and lower tourist traffic, our product across core and emerging categories was well received and we achieved strong sell-through in most regions. Revenue growth of 7% in constant currency in the fourth quarter was ahead of our guidance. We delivered profits above expectations driven by better top line performance and the attention to disciplined operational and expense management by our teams. Now let me turn to some highlights for the quarter. Our North America Wholesale business was the standout performer in the fourth quarter and achieved record sales and profitability. Our three largest and most-developed businesses, men's, women's and children's, were all up which speaks to the appeal of our brand and product. Our design and merchandising teams continue to produce fresh, compelling assortments that resonate with both new and existing customers. In terms of product category highlights, our dress, accessories and footwear offerings and the Denim & Supply brand delivered strong growth in stores and online driven by door expansion and positive consumer response to our unique voice. We grew market share for the full-year in a competitive retail environment which we believe is due not only to our product, but also our steady investment in shop environments and marketing that express the distinction of our brands. Global e-commerce revenues grew in the high teens for the fourth quarter, representing strong momentum for one of our most important areas of strategic focus. Traffic to our website in all regions increased significantly, including a 48% increase in mobile traffic in North America. Additionally, enhanced site search functionality has led to higher conversion. We are on track with the design and architecture of our new e-commerce platform and are confident its capabilities will enable us to achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in this channel. Another highlight in the quarter was our luxury business where we saw strong performance in our men's and women's lines. We saw higher conversion rates in our retail stores and believe that they are the result of terrific products as well as a sharp focus on store level execution and new approaches to educating our sales associates. This offset some of the challenging traffic trends due to a decline in global travel by the luxury tourist customer. We are also seeing the positive impact of our SKU reduction initiatives, with sales up on a third fewer SKUs in our women's business. Speaking to our luxury product highlights, in the quarter the newest addition to our iconic Ricky handbag portfolio, the Drawstring Ricky is already enjoying nice success. The launch of this new silhouette supported by a strong advertising and marketing campaign garnered a great deal of editorial attention in the fashion press and on social media. And that has translated to an encouraging consumer response. Our new lightweight cashmere scarf collection was introduced in limited palettes and was expanded to offer a spectacular assortment of bright colors for which Ralph Lauren's brand is so well known. We remain committed to the growth of all of our accessory categories and expect to see their higher purchase frequency bring customers into the store and online more frequently. Finally, we made the decision to merge our luxury lines in both men's and women's into a single label, Ralph Lauren Collection for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. We believe this will clarify our luxury message, driving consistent global brand presentation and marketing synergies. Response to the change from our retail partners and sales associates has been extremely positive and we are optimistic that this will not only drive strong sales performance, but will also reduce expenses by maximizing productivity and creating focused assortments. We expect to transition these businesses for the pre-spring 2016 season. Now I'd like to provide some perspective on sales trends by region. In the Americas, our largest region, revenues grew 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter. This was led by double-digit growth in our North America Wholesale business and mid-teen growth in our U.S. e-commerce business. Retail sales continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our European revenues rose 5% in constant currency during the fourth quarter, led by strong spring wholesale shipments and an increase in reorders. Our men's apparel business saw especially strong demand at wholesale. In our own retail stores, we continued to be impacted by lower tourist traffic, especially those coming from Russia and the Middle East who have been most severely impacted by the volatility in both currency and commodity markets. Generally speaking, we saw the best trends in Northern and Central Europe; while the negative impact of the terrorist attacks has continued to challenge France, and the Middle East is of course affected by lower oil prices and a decline in Russian tourists. In Asia we achieved 1% constant currency revenue growth, with trends varying by country. Korean sales remain challenging for the apparel sector, especially in department stores, which represent the majority of our distribution. Hong Kong store traffic remained pressured and Southeast Asia was soft due to travel concerns. In Greater China, double-digit constant currency revenue growth largely reflects the investment we've made in new distribution. Highlights in the region included strong sell-throughs on spring product and the continued positive response to women's Polo. I'd like to mention the efforts of our global supply chain organization during the quarter. This team has done an outstanding job navigating through the extended West Coast port situation and maintaining business continuity with limited incremental expense. This is a significant achievement given the breadth and scale of our product portfolio and distribution. During this time, the team also supported record wholesale shipment volume in the fourth quarter while continuing to manage expenses. I want to extend my thanks for their extraordinary work. On our last call, I spoke about the next exciting endeavor for our iconic Polo brand, the global launch of Polo Sport. Beginning with the introduction of men's and boy's lines for the fall 2015 season, the product will be available for preorder on ralphlauren.com in June and available in our retail stores and wholesale partners around the world in August. The latter timing coincides with a dedicated advertising campaign featuring distinctive imagery that will position Polo Sport as authentic modern active wear. Across the globe, feedback on this product has been terrific and Polo Sport is seen as the perfect fit with the athletic spirit and sensibility that have always been an important element of the Polo brand. As you know, the active segment of the apparel market is growing at a rapid rate and both we and our wholesale partners believe this is a significant long-term market share opportunity. Finally, I'd like to update you on our progress with the new global brand management structure we first spoke about on our last call. At that time, I spoke briefly about the factors and opportunities that led us to make the decision to shift from a more decentralized regional and channel structure to a centralized global brand management model. Today I want to provide more detail. Over the nearly 48 years since the company began we've grown significantly, with the last dozen years realizing accelerated growth due to the acquisition of the majority of our product licenses and geographic territories. This gave us greater control of our brand, but led to tremendous organizational complexity. Our new operating model and processes will allow us to fully leverage the power of each of our brands to ensure the greatest consistency of expression around the world and drive growth. We have always believed that our brands are our greatest assets and that will now be reflected in the structure of the company. We are not changing who we are, we are changing how we work. And the opportunities associated with this transformation are very exciting. As the first step in the transition to the new operating model, last month we announced changes to our executive leadership, most notably the promotion of Chris Peterson to President of Global Brands. We will continue to share updates on future calls and expect to drive significant operating and cost efficiencies that will help support the strong sales and profit growth we expect over the next five years. Chris will take you through the details of the financial impact of our actions around the reorganization to fiscal 2016 and beyond. I'm very proud of our ability to focus on and invest in the company's long-term growth objectives while managing day-to-day operations to our exacting standards and most recently engage in the discussion and analysis required to set our future structure up for great success. This speaks to the talent and the experience of our senior leaders, the dedication of our teams across every area, our rigorous attention to operational and expense management and of course the desirability of our products and the power of our brands. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by welcoming Bob Madore who is joining us on the call today. Last month we named Bob, Chief Financial Officer of the company, reporting to me. You all have a chance to meet Bob over the next several months, and I know he is looking forward to it. Now I'd like to turn to a brief recap of the quarter. On a constant currency basis revenues increased 7%, better than the mid-single-digit growth rate we guided to in February, driven by strength in the wholesale segment and global e-commerce. Importantly, this growth was achieved on top of a 14% gain in the prior-year period. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was 550 basis points, in line with our expectations. Every geographic region grew in constant currency during the quarter. On a reported basis, net revenues rose 1% to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full-year fiscal 2015 period, net revenues grew 4% in constant currency and 2% on a reported basis to $7.6 billion. Gross profit margin of 55.4% in the fourth quarter was 80 basis points below the prior-year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects and mix shift impacts. Operating margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter was 190 basis points below the prior-year, attributable to the negative impact of foreign exchange and incremental investments in the company's long-term growth initiatives. Operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of 250 basis points to 300 basis points decrease. The outperformance was driven by better-than-expected revenues and disciplined expense management throughout the organization. For the full-year 2015 period, operating margin declined 160 basis points to 13.6% due to investments we made to strengthen the company's infrastructure and global store network expansion initiatives as well as negative foreign exchange impacts. Net income for the fourth quarter was $124 million or $1.41 per diluted share. Excluding foreign currency impacts, earnings per share was $1.69 for the fourth quarter, essentially in line with $1.68 we reported in the prior-year period. For the full-year 2015 net income was $702 million or $7.88 per diluted share. Excluding currency impacts, EPS was $8.19 for fiscal 2015 compared to $8.43 in fiscal 2014. The effective tax rate of 28% in the fourth quarter was lower than expected due to one-time discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior year period. Moving onto segment performance, wholesale revenues increased 8% in constant currency during the fourth quarter which was achieved on top of a 24% gain in the prior-year period. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $1 billion were 2% above the prior-year period. North America posted double-digit increases and Europe grew mid-single digits in constant currency as we gained market share in both regions. Growth was driven in part by accelerated demand for spring merchandise by our customers as Easter was two weeks earlier than last year and strong reorders in Europe. Wholesale operating margin of 30.7% in the fourth quarter was 60 basis points above the prior year period due to improved profitability of core operations partially offset by foreign exchange impacts. Retail sales rose 6% in constant currency to $841 million and were roughly in line with last year on a reported basis. Growth was driven by the incremental contribution from new stores and high teen's growth for global e-commerce. Comparable store sales were up 1% in constant currency and declined 4% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange impacts. Constant dollar comp trends reflect strong e-commerce performance that was somewhat offset by challenging traffic trends at brick-and-mortar stores especially in markets where currency movements impacted tourist traffic. By region, constant currency comps increased in the Americas and Europe, while Asia was slightly down. Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter was 3.4%, 270 basis points below the prior year period reflecting investments in new store development and lower profitability in core operations. Licensing revenue declined 5% and operating income was down 6% in the fourth quarter primarily due to negative foreign currency effects and the anniversary of the launch of Polo Red fragrance in the prior-year period. Consolidated inventory was $1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support anticipated sales growth and new store openings. We spent $391 million on capital expenditures during the year, mostly to support new retail stores and infrastructure projects. Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock during fiscal 2015 at a cost of $500 million and returned an additional $158 million to shareholders via dividend payments. In total, the company returned approximately $658 million to shareholders during the year which represents an almost 6% effective yield. Yesterday the company's board of directors authorized an additional $500 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $80 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as part of a previously-authorized stock repurchase program bringing the company's total current authorization to $580 million. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Overall, we are pleased with the better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful foreign exchange and environmental headwinds. Now I'd like to turn to fiscal 2016. We expect fiscal 2016 to be a year of significant transformation for the company. We will move to the new brand management organization structure, make important infrastructure investments, continue retail store development and take decisive action to mitigate foreign-currency pressures. Let me take these each in turn. As Jacki spoke about, we have made meaningful progress on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure. The most important aspect of this new operating model is that it brings disparate functions of design, merchandising, planning, creative and marketing, to form dedicated brand groups. We are creating six global brand groups, each run by a brand president. These brand groups will define global design, merchandising and marketing strategies and be accountable for the global financial performance of the business. Brand and business strategies will be developed in concert with the leaders of the regions and channels who understand the critical dynamics and nuances of these specialized areas. These brand groups will also rely on the strong knowledge and capabilities of our shared services teams. The new model processes and single view visibility to each brand will allow us to be more nimble and responsive to the marketplace and operate as a truly global business. This will enable us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operating and financial efficiencies. For example, the new structure and processes will enable a significant reduction in SKUs, which will lead to better inventory turns, better gross margins and SG&A cost savings. From a timing standpoint, it will take several months to transition to the new operating model. Overall we are on track to achieve over $100 million of annual expense savings from this initiative. Only a modest amount of this will be realized in fiscal 2016 with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other one-time related charges of approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization. From a timing perspective, we expect these charges to be heavily weighted in the first half of the year. This charge encompasses two elements. First is the cost of separation associated with employee head count reduction. We expect to reduce our full-time workforce by approximately 5%. The second element is the cost of store and shop repositioning related to providing more clarity across our different brand presentations, including the merging of our luxury labels. We are very excited about the move to the new structure as we believe it will create a platform for profitable growth, by allowing us to both improve our global brand equities and drive operating efficiency over time. Moving to store development, we plan to open approximately 40 to 50 directly operated stores in fiscal 2016 on a global basis. We expect that our new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal 2016 as our accelerated store opening pace is now in our base. On infrastructure investments our e-commerce re-platform initiative will begin to ramp-up in fiscal 2016. This is a multi-year initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the online customer shopping experience. Our SAP implementation is substantially complete in North America and we began SAP implementation for Europe this year. We expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the e-commerce re-platforming initiative. Moving to foreign exchange, we have taken decisive actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. First we are raising prices in certain markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid-to-high single-digit range and will be effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Second, our supply chain organization has negotiated lower cost across our manufacturing base as a result of lower raw material and oil prices as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar. These lower costs will also become effective in the back half of the fiscal year. Finally we will reduce operating cost by restructuring the organization. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to review our detailed outlook for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year, similar to the view we shared with you in February. The growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we've invested over the last several years. These include new product development, new stores and global e-commerce. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale due to new store development and continued momentum in e-commerce. Based on current exchange rates foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal 2016 revenue growth. Moving on to operating income. On a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2016, which we intend to reinvest in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce re-platforming and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis we expect our full-year fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 180 basis points to 230 basis points below fiscal 2015's level due entirely to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes restructuring and other one-time related charges associated with our global brand reorganization. We continue to expect the negative impact of FX on operating income to approximate $185 million, similar to what we projected in February, based on current exchange rates. In terms of the sensitivity of our operating income to movements in exchange rates a change of about a nickel in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by approximately $20 million on a full-year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be flat in constant currency as retail segment growth is offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, which is impacted by our customers receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the first quarter to be 600 basis points. Our operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 600 basis points to 650 basis points below the prior-year period due to negative foreign currency effects, the quarterly revenue growth profile and timing of expense savings initiatives. The first quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. We are very excited about the company's potential for future growth. We are organizing the company to drive the power of brands, investing in key infrastructure projects and making strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time. With that, we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that? Operator : Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for all the color and the information. I wanted to ask more about a lot of the reorganization activities both Chris and Jacki touched upon, especially in light of the simplification of the luxury brand segment. Can you talk more about the six different brand groups? What are the brand groups? Does it also include a simplification from the many different sub brands that have existed within the overall Ralph Lauren halo? Are the systems now in place to support these new organizational structures? What's the timeframe that we think this will kind of be executed? And then I guess lastly, within that, as we think about all the changes going on at the company this year, I think you said a year of transformation, Chris, how do we get comfortable with the kind of underlying organic revenue growth rate you have planned for mid-single digits this year, especially since comps have been a little bit sluggish in North America. Thank you. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah, so let's start on the reorganization. So I think we provided a little bit more color. The six brand groups that we're talking about are, one that's going to be focused on our luxury business which will include the Ralph Lauren brand and the RRL brand which Val\u00e9rie Hermann will lead as the brand President. We will have a brand group focused on Polo, we'll have a brand group focused on Denim & Supply. We'll have a brand group focused on Lauren, Chaps and American Living as a group. We will have a brand group that's focused on the Ralph Lauren Home business and finally, Club Monaco will be the sixth brand group, and that's how we're organizing the brand groups. Each of the brand groups will have a brand President and a dedicated leadership team to run the business. We believe that this is going to lead to simplification over time of many of the sub brands in terms of how we go to market from a consumer standpoint because we think that what this is going to allow us to do is focus our resources and our consumer communication more at the master brand level than at the sub brands. The only sub brand that we have announced that we're merging at this point is on the luxury side of the business with the Black Label and Purple Label and Women's Collection and Black Label business. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Well, before we go to the next question, there were a couple of parts of Omar's question. From a systems perspective, let me provide a little bit more color on that as well. I think we feel very good about where we are from a systems standpoint, although there's still more work to do. The SAP implementation that we've done is now complete with regard to our global manufacturing and supply chain system and complete in the North America order-to-cash for wholesale. And what that has allowed us to do is have global visibility to our style count, our SKU count, and it's allowed us to get to a point where we now have global financial data by brand, which we've just been able to implement, which of course is one of the key enablers to moving to the global brand structure. So I think there's more work to do as we move into the new model, but I feel good about where we are and where we're headed from a systems standpoint. And finally, from a transition timing standpoint, I think we expect to form the brand groups over the next month or two, but of course as we form the new brand groups it will take them some time to come up to speed and then the first seasons that they will begin to impact, because of our development cycle, will be probably 12 months to 18 months from now. Operator : Thank you. We'll move on to Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. First off, congrats to Bob and good to have you on the call. And then, Chris, thanks for all the detail on the investment buckets. First off, I guess the first question would be, can you just help me clarify the guidance a little bit. It looks like the revenue impact from FX improved by 100 basis points but the implied operating margin dollars you talked about stayed the same. I think that leaves the underlying operating margin a little lower than what you mentioned in February, and the Swiss dollar got a little better, I think. So maybe you could just tell us about what changed from the February update? And then a little bit longer term on fiscal 2017 margins is a big focus for the stock recently. As we talked, you seemed confident that fiscal 2017 would be the year when the investment buckets that we've talked about with you for a while now would start to lift off, and as you add in the organizational changes that you talked about today and sharpen your strategy around that, are you comfortable at this point talking to us about how you see the long-term margin trajectory beyond the guidance you gave us for 2016 at this point? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. So let me try to take those each in turn. So the first question on the update on the FX impact to fiscal 2016, I think when we gave our guidance in February, it was before we had finalized our budgets and we had given an estimate in terms of the foreign exchange impact to the top line and the bottom line. As we finalized our budgets we also updated our exposure model. And so the change in the expected revenue impact from 550 basis points on the top line to 450 basis points was really due to a sharpening of our exposure model. As we looked at the bottom line impact, the bottom line impact was in line with what we thought at the last time. So I think it was more a function of finalizing the budgets and updating the exposure model with regard to the change in the \u2013 the slight change in the FX guidance for fiscal 2016. On the second question, in terms of what does it mean for fiscal 2017, I think that there's going to be a couple of different things happening in fiscal 2017 and it's premature for us to give guidance that far out. But obviously we would expect to see a full year impact of the pricing action that we're taking, which would be a positive. We would expect to see a full year impact of the cost reductions that we're taking, which would be a positive, and we would expect to see a ramp-up of the restructuring savings, which would be a positive. And so all of those would lead to a better operating margin outlook in 2017. On the negative side, we have hedged our FX exposure. And so as those hedges roll off, we will have a year-on-year hedge FX hurt continuing into fiscal 2017 from the portion of the business that was hedged in fiscal 2016. Premature to talk about how those net against each other, but I think those are the underlying trends. And I think to your question about sort of the infrastructure investments being at the highest level, I do expect that fiscal 2016 will likely be the highest level of investment on the infrastructure investments in total. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good morning. My question, Chris, is around higher prices where you had mentioned that you're raising prices. They sound fairly aggressive in the mid-to-high single-digit range. What's giving you the confidence of the pass through of these prices? And are you increasing the price of products across the board on all your products in the countries you called out or is it more selective? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. So I think a couple of things, we are increasing prices across the board on all of the products in the countries I called out, but the percentage increase will be different by product. So we're obviously looking at the pricing to hit key price points and so forth. But the numbers I gave you were sort of averages across the line in terms of the pricing actions that we're taking. Too soon to tell how those pricing actions are going to play out, because obviously it's going to depend on how competitors respond as well in these markets, but our view is that with the significant impact of foreign currency in these markets, all of the competitors that source products from similar countries should be seeing a similar transactional impact. And what we're trying to do is price per transactional foreign exchange, but not for translational foreign exchange and that's how we came to the price increases that we're looking at here. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to get maybe some further detail on your U.S. Wholesale business which, as you called out was up double digits in the quarter. As I look back and I know that we don't get all of the details, but it seemed like in Q1 through Q3 of fiscal 2014, your U.S. wholesale sales may have been flat or down a little, and then fourth quarter is obviously very strong and we're looking for a deceleration in the first quarter of 2015. Can you help us understand what the underlying sort of sell through trend has been for U.S. wholesale and how much of the fourth quarter benefit was a function of shipping timing versus maybe an acceleration in kind of run rate? Thanks. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. Yeah, I think the way to think about this is that the seasons that we operate in don't match up with our fiscal quarter reporting periods. And because of that, sometimes our seasonal flow of inventory from a shipment standpoint isn't really indicative of the underlying trend. I think we felt like, for the entire fiscal year, when you look at the fall season and the Cruise/Holiday season and into the spring season, that we had plans that were growing market share in the U.S. Wholesale business pretty consistently, and sometimes that growth in market share which has us growing a couple of points faster than the U.S. wholesale industry doesn't necessarily show up in terms of the shipment pattern because of the way the customer receipt plans fall within our fiscal quarters. So our underlying view of the business continues to be very positive in terms of the market share gains that we've experienced in that channel. Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Just to add to Chris's comments, we track our market share very carefully in all of our distribution and we continue to increase market share. As Chris spoke to, we also look very carefully at how we're tracking against every key competitor, every key department store, and as I said, we are very pleased with our results. All of our core businesses have been quite strong, and we saw a nice acceleration within the spring season. Many of the products that are smaller parts of our company have started to gain nice acceleration. Our footwear business, our accessory business, our Denim & Supply business, the dress business has been very strong and, of course, our core businesses continue as the backbone. So we're seeing door growth, we're seeing great sales growth, and we see that strengthening. As I said, we're also very optimistic about our Polo women's business which was new to us starting with last fall, and we're seeing door growth there as well. And then of course we're about to launch our new Polo Sport business where there's tremendous enthusiasm about that opportunity because that really puts us solidly into a new area of opportunity, and we believe that with the credibility that we have in the athletic area with our relationship with the U.S. Open, the Olympics, Wimbledon, et cetera, USGA, that we have a tremendous amount of credibility with the consumer that we've really never tapped into. So this really gives us the opportunity to put our great foot forward in a new area of opportunity for the company, and of course we're a couple of months away from that launch, which we're excited about. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes, could you talk a little bit about responsibilities under the new management structure? Who's responsible for the supply chain and the back office systems under the new architecture? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. So the supply chain and the back office will continue to be operated as they are today by our shared service group. So we have a shared service group today that handles global manufacturing and supply chain, that handles finance, that handles HR, that handles real estate, that handles operational capabilities, and that will continue because we believe that those groups are better leveraged across the entire enterprise and we don't intend to disrupt that. What we're talking about in the new structure is really organizing a lot of the front-end parts of the organization, as we talked about, with design and merchandising and planning and creative and marketing into dedicated brand groups so that we have a single global face to the consumer on a by-brand basis. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays. Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just going back to North America and maybe focusing on the Retail business as well, it sounded like the comps \u2013 I think you said the Americas comp increased in constant currency, which I think was better than last quarter. So maybe you could talk a little bit about what changed this quarter and also how we can think about the overall North American business combined on a go-forward basis? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yes, we saw strong growth in the U.S. business during the quarter, and I think it was a function of several things. I think we talked about the Wholesale business having very strong shipment growth. If you looked at the Retail business, though, the Retail business on a constant currency basis also improved, and I think that the outlet channel in the U.S. comp improved versus what we were seeing previously, and that was both a function of traffic trends getting a little bit better than what we saw in the third quarter as well as improvement in conversion rate that we drove during the quarter in the outlet channel. We also saw continued very strong comp store growth in our e-commerce business, that was in the high-double digits. The one channel that was under a little bit of pressure during the quarter was the full-price retail stores, and that was really a function of the slowdown in international tourist traffic, as we talked about, primarily the Russian, Middle East and Brazilian consumers which were impacted. But overall an improvement in comp store sales trends in the Americas as well as in the wholesale shipment business. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff Siris - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi, everybody. Can you talk about how long SAP in Europe will take to be fully implemented? And then can we assume that Asia and the rest of the world will be an FY 2017 event? And then on the $100 million in savings, FY 2016 versus FY 2017, you talked about most of it being in 2017. Can we assume that 25% to 30% will be in the second half of 2016 and the rest in FY 2017, or is there another ratio we should be thinking about? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. So on the savings piece, I think 25% to 30% being in fiscal 2016 is probably a reasonable estimate, and obviously a much more significant portion being in fiscal 2017. So I think that's a reasonable estimate. On SAP in Europe, we're starting the program, or we've started the program a few months ago. We expect to complete the SAP implementation over the next 12 months to 18 months in Europe, and it's going to be in two phases. I think we're doing the HR implementation first and then we'll do in the second phase the financials and the order-to-cash part of the process in the Wholesale business there. We don't intend to start the Asia SAP look until after we complete Europe, and so we don't have yet a timeline for when Asia will happen, but certainly we would intend for it to be after the European implementation. It may not be in fiscal 2017. It could be in 2018 or 2019. Too soon for us to have that in our planning horizon at this point. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you. Good morning. Could you speak a little bit more about what you're seeing broadly in Europe, both in the fourth quarter and then how you're planning that in fiscal 2016? I recognize there's a lot of flux in global tourism, but would love any kind of color about local demand versus tourist demand in that region? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yes, so we were encouraged by what we saw in the fourth quarter. We continue to drive mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth trends, both in the Wholesale business and in the Retail business during the quarter. I think we continue to see the trends being the strongest in Northern Europe, both the U.K. and Scandinavia. We see Southern Europe importantly stabilizing and beginning to get back to a period where we think we can grow from, and I think Central Europe, France and others, have been a little bit more under pressure. The biggest impact in Europe that we've seen is the traffic drop from the Russian and Middle Eastern tourists. And really the Russian tourist has dropped off more precipitously than the Middle Eastern tourist during that period, but we continue to see strong influx of Chinese tourist into the region, and so that's what we're seeing. I think given our penetration in Europe, we continue to believe that Europe will be a growth market for us for some time to come. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Good morning. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you talk about as you went through the budget process this past quarter, what might have changed and how that could have influenced or impacted the EBIT margin guidance one way or the other? And then just my second question is on with the new operating structure, you mentioned it'll help clarify the brand presentation. Can you give an example of how maybe that brand presentation is clear as you would like it to be, and how that might change and how that could impact how the consumer views the brand and how that might impact their willingness to buy the product? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Okay. So as we finalize the budget process, I think our view is that the FX impact came in virtually pretty close to in line with what we thought when we had done the initial estimates in February. So our view on the fiscal year guidance is that it really is not much changed from what we thought we were going to see in February. We're seeing the same constant currency revenue growth and we're seeing the same underlying operating margin trend from the continuing operations, the same investment in the infrastructure and the same operating income impact from foreign exchange. So we viewed it as pretty close to what we thought in February as the budget process finalized. So there isn't anything really to call out there of significance in terms of difference. On the... Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: And on the product presentation, the brand presentation around the world, what we're really looking at and what we're really focused on is by narrowing our SKU presentation that we offer through every channel and region, what we'll be able to do is through that narrowing and through that focus be able to represent the brand in the same way around the world. Today, because of the SKU proliferation and the style proliferation that we have, what happens is we actually have less than 10% of common styles that are represented in our presentations around the world. And what we want to do is have that closer to 60% to 70%, so that the customer which has a worldview today between how they are traveling and where they are shopping and the online experience, we want that to be the same experience. And so that's what we're really focused on, and we believe that that will allow us to not only present our product in a clearer way but also be able to represent it in marketing in a much clearer way and in a much more focused presentation. And so that's really what we feel the great benefit will be in terms of that brand presentation. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you could give us an update on your accessories business, how it's doing. Do you continue to expect this business to grow at a faster rate than the balance and maybe some of the initiatives you have in this category? Thank you. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. So accessories remains an area that we expect to grow faster than the balance of the business. We've been growing accessories consistently faster than the balance of the business and it has been increasing as the penetration of the total company's revenue. I think there's a number of things that we're trying to do in the accessories space to try to drive that. Notably during the past few months we launched the Drawstring bag, as Jacki talked about, under the Ricky franchise in the luxury part of the accessories business which is off to a very strong start. I think the other thing that we've been working on is developing and launching as part of the women's Polo business a more significant accessories offering under the women's Polo line, which we're very excited about and is coming in the not-too-distant future. And then I think we continue to be encouraged by the strong results we've seen in the Lauren accessories business. And so I think we've got a multi-tiered strategy to go after the accessories business that I think we're confident will allow us to grow that business at an accelerated pace for the foreseeable future. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : All right. Well, thank you very much for joining us on the call today. I think we're excited about the direction that we're headed. It is going to be a year of transformation for us, and we look forward to talking more with each of you about it over the next few months. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead. Evren Kopelman - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. The agenda for this morning's call includes an overview of the quarter and an update on our broader strategic initiatives from Jacki Nemerov, our President and COO; followed by financial perspective on the first quarter from Bob Madore, our CFO; and concluding with commentary on our organizational restructure as well as our expectations for fiscal 2016 from Chris Peterson, our President of Global Brands. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jacki. Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of our new fiscal year, we delivered revenues in line with our guidance and profits that were better than our expectations. This was driven by the company's attention to careful, disciplined operational and expense management. We are pleased with these results in the context of the environment in which we operate and we are on track to deliver our plan for the fiscal year. We see the year developing as one of steady quarter-by-quarter improvement. Looking at the first half, we are negatively impacted by the Easter calendar, significant foreign exchange pressure and our infrastructure investments. In the second half, we expect to see both sales and profit improvement due to the launch of Polo Sport and the opening of our new stores, the impact of product cost savings and pricing actions, and the benefit of our restructuring activities. In addition, the foreign exchange pressure will lessen as the year progresses. Now let me turn to the quarter. There were several factors impacting our results : first, the shift in global tourist traffic patterns around the world; second, but related to the first point, the changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the increasingly promotional U.S. retail environment. We are taking decisive actions to most effectively operate in this changing environment. We always take a long-term view to protect both our brand and our profitability. While our infrastructure investments have pressured our operating margin in the short term, we believe these are the right investments that will pay off in the future. Let me give you more texture on each of these topics. In the first quarter, the impact of currency movements on global tourism was especially pronounced. We saw significant increases in traffic in Europe and Japan, and a decline in the U.S. We see that the customer is more astute than ever and adjusts travel and purchasing plans to make the smartest spending decisions. Our business was up double-digits in Europe and Japan, where the local currencies have weakened and tourism has increased. In Japan, an increase in traffic from Chinese tourists and more domestic consumption from the Japanese, as they traveled less overseas due to their weaker currency, drove the business. We also had specific merchandising and marketing initiatives implemented by our teams that were quite successful. Europe experienced similar strength as tourist traffic increased with the weaker euro, and demand was especially strong in wholesale. In the U.S., the impact was disproportionate for us, as our distribution skews to the larger cities that have experienced the most significant slowdowns in traffic and spending from the foreign tourist. Roughly half of our U.S. Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores are in major gateway cities, such as New York, Miami and San Francisco. Many of our largest points of wholesale distribution are also in major gateway cities. And finally, our factory outlet presence is heavily skewed to centers that tend to attract more foreign tourists. In the balance of our distribution across the rest of the country, our performance has been on or above plan, which tells us that the strength of our brands and appeal of our products remain high. Now, let me turn to the retail environment in the U.S. The industry saw a late start to the spring season due to issues related to the West Coast port delays and an unseasonably cold weather pattern, as well as the lower tourist traffic I spoke about earlier. These conditions created an excessive inventory and, therefore, more promotional environment in North America. We made the decision to be less promotional than the landscape, because we believe it's critical to protect our brand. Looking at comp growth across some of our largest customers, we are in line or better than their stores' average performance. For our retail business, revenue was up 3% in constant currency in the first quarter. Global same-store sales were down 2% due to a slowdown in e-commerce. e-commerce revenue was up 2%, which was softer than prior quarters. As I referenced earlier, the environment in North America was highly promotional in the quarter, and this was more pronounced online. And again, we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape and achieved a higher average unit retail over the prior-year period as a result. While we knew this decision could slow our revenue growth, we believed it was the right thing to do for our brand. We have seen a pick-up in sales at the beginning of the second quarter. However, we remain cautious as most of the quarter remains ahead of us. Now, I'd like to provide some perspective on international sales trends. As I mentioned, Europe had a strong quarter, with revenue up 10% in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong, with robust sell-throughs and reorders, and all brands across the portfolio are performing well. By region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best. In Asia, revenue was up 9% in constant currency. Japan, which is our largest business in Asia, had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, driven by successful merchandising and marketing initiatives as well as the increase in traffic from Chinese tourists that I previously mentioned. In Korea, we experienced a strong trend until the MERS outbreak in June, which negatively impacted traffic. China was strong, once again, with double-digit comp growth. Hong Kong and Macau traffic remain pressured, but we saw improvement in our conversion rate. We continue to see strong performance of women's Polo and the expansion of the Lauren brand through new distribution in Japan and Korea, which represents an additional opportunity for growth. Turning to some of the product highlights, let me begin with luxury. I spoke on our last call about the merging of our luxury labels to create a singular Ralph Lauren Collection label for women and Ralph Lauren Purple Label for men. I'm delighted to report that this is on track for the spring 2016 season, with positive feedback from both the retail and editorial communities, who immediately understood the clarity of our offering. For the first time in many years, Ralph Lauren participated in Milan Men's Fashion Week with an elegant and exclusive presentation of the spring 2016 Purple Label collection. This took place at the Ralph Lauren Palazzo in the heart of Milan that beautifully represents the aesthetic and sensibility of Ralph Lauren luxury. Within the accessories part of the luxury business, we are continuing to expand the signature Ricky handbag line with the newest style, the Drawstring Ricky that was featured in our most recent advertising campaign. We will continue to grow our luxury accessory assortment and broaden the price tiering of our product offering. Turning to the Polo brand, we unveiled our new Polo Sport line in mid-June on ralphlauren.com in the U.S. and have seen strong interest through our preorder capability. Starting with men's and boys' product, this performance-oriented collection not only brings forward an important aspect of the Polo heritage and DNA, but also speaks to the performance-inspired active trend. Polo Sport will be available in our own stores and select department stores worldwide later this month and will be introduced at DICK'S Sporting Goods in late fall. Our Polo Tech shirt, which combines the aesthetic of Polo Sport and industry-leading advancements in wearable technology, will also be available for purchase later this month. This high-performance shirt will be supported by an interactive Polo Tech app that will feature exclusive video content that allows the wearer to optimize training performance. We presented our spring 2016 collections for Polo sportswear, Polo tailored clothing and Polo Sport as part of the first-ever New York Men's Fashion Week last month, and the reception across the board was very strong with a tremendous amount of favorable commentary on the evolution of the brand. Turning to the women's component of our Polo brand, as we enter its second year, we will be broadening the product line to address additional dimensions of our customer's lifestyle. Denim & Supply continues to see strong growth in both men's and women's. Both Polo for Women and Denim & Supply feature product that spoke to some of the season's biggest trends, such as bohemian looks and fringe details, which are core to our DNA. And across all brands, we had terrific consumer response to our denim offerings. Our dress business, Lauren footwear and Lauren accessories are also performing well. In our licensed businesses, men's Polo furnishings, Lauren tailored clothing and home continue to grow and gain market share in the department store channel. We remain focused on managing the business and the brands for the long term. We continue to be disciplined about expense management, especially given the challenging macro operating environment, in order to allow us to thoughtfully invest in our long-term strategic growth initiatives. I would like to recognize the talent, experience and dedication of our senior leaders and their teams. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Jacki, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenues were in line with the prior year, driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally. This is in line with the guidance we provided in May. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, which is slightly better than we anticipated as the euro performed slightly better against the U.S. dollar. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 5% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter. Gross profit margin was 59.8% in the first quarter excluding restructuring-related non-cash charges of $3 million. This was 120 basis points below the prior-year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating margin in the first quarter was 8.8% excluding restructuring and related non-cash charges. This was 550 basis points below the prior year; however, better than the outlook we provided in May of 600 basis point to 650 basis point decrease. The operating margin came in better than our guidance due to disciplined operational management across the organization. Lower operating margin was attributable to the timing of revenue receipts in our wholesale business, incremental investments in infrastructure, and negative foreign currency effects. Net income for the first quarter was $95 million or $1.09 per diluted share excluding restructuring and related non-cash charges. On a reported basis, net income was $64 million or $0.73 per diluted share. The effective tax rate of 30% in the first quarter, on an adjusted basis, was in line with our guidance and compared to an effective tax rate of 31% in the prior-year period. Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues declined 6% in constant currency during the first quarter. Wholesale revenue was negatively impacted by our customers' receipt plans due to an earlier Easter this year, which was partially offset by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe. Combining the two quarters to take a more holistic view of the Spring/Summer season, global wholesale revenues were up approximately 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis wholesale revenues of $642 million were 9% below the prior-year period. Wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 21.8% excluding restructuring related non-cash charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior-year period due to the change in customer receipt plans. Retail sales increased 3% in constant currency to $935 million. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and e-commerce expansion. Comparable store sales declined 2% in constant currency and declined 8% on a reported basis. In Europe and Asia, same-store sales growth was positive with particular strength in Japan and China. In North America, the strong U.S. dollar pressured tourist traffic in the overall retail environment. As Jacki mentioned, comps in brick-and-mortar stores were similar to last quarter in the range of down 2% to 3%; however, e-commerce growth was softer than prior quarters at up 2%. Again, the online environment in North America became highly promotional in the quarter and we chose to stay less promotional than the landscape. We achieved a higher average unit retail and higher average order value over the prior period as the results. Excluding restructuring related non-cash charges, retail operating margin in the first quarter was 12.6%, which was 490 points below the prior-year period, reflecting fixed expense deleverage and negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 6% in constant currency during the first quarter and licensing operating income was in line with the prior-year period. Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support new store openings, the launch of Polo Sport and increased shipments of Polo Women's, as well as a change in the timing of receipt plans. In addition, we spent $68 million on capital expenditures compared to $85 million in the prior-year period. The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter at a cost of $150 million, and at the end of the first quarter approximately $430 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Overall, we're pleased with the better-than-expected first quarter results. Disciplined planning and day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to give you an update on our global brand reorganization effort and guidance for fiscal 2016. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share an update on our transition to the new global brand management organization structure we spoke about on our last call, as we have made significant progress. In the last 90 days, we established six global brand groups, and I'm pleased to report that we have filled all of the global brand president roles. These presidents reflect an equal balance of Ralph Lauren veterans with significant experience inside our organization, and outside talent with critical category expertise. In addition to the six brand presidents, we have also begun to identify the design, merchandising, marketing and finance leads for their respective teams and are pleased with the way these groups are forming. A key element of our new operating model is the introduction of a global line planning process. This is the end-to-end process by which we design, merchandise and plan our assortments. We have kicked it off in our Polo Men's business as a pilot for the fall 2016 season. We will use learnings from this pilot to inform its roll-out across the other brands in spring 2017 and beyond. We expect this new process to improve brand equity and revenue growth by creating better assortments and more consistent brand messaging, and drive operating efficiencies at the same time. The new organization structure and its accompanying processes will lead to a significant reduction in SKUs as well as sample and design costs, which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins and meaningful SG&A cost savings. We expect to see the benefits from the global line planning process in the next 18 months to 24 months as it rolls out across the portfolio. We also implemented the head count reduction that we spoke about on our last call. These were difficult, but necessary, decisions and we are on track to realize the $100 million in annual expense savings we spoke about previously, driven by the move to the new organization model. Only a modest amount of the benefits will be realized in fiscal 2016, with more significant savings to come in fiscal 2017 and beyond. We expect to incur restructuring and other one-time related charges of approximately $70 million to $100 million as a result of this reorganization, and we've recognized $45 million of this expected charge in the first quarter. This charge encompasses the cost of separation associated with our workforce reduction as well as the cost of store and shop adjustments to provide greater clarity of brand presentation. We're very encouraged by the early stages of our transition and pleased to report that it has gone smoothly. We now feel even more confident that it will allow us to maximize growth and achieve meaningful operational and financial efficiencies. Before I turn to guidance for fiscal 2016, I wanted to give an update on some of our key initiatives around new store development, infrastructure investments and our efforts to mitigate foreign exchange impacts. In the first quarter, we opened six directly operated and 15 licensed stores around the world. We are on track to open 40 to 50 directly operated stores in fiscal 2016. We continue to expect that these new store investments will be neutral to year-on-year margins in fiscal 2016 as the accelerated store opening pace is now in our base. Regarding infrastructure investments, our e-commerce re-platform is on schedule and ramping up as planned. This is a multiyear initiative to significantly improve the company's omni-channel capabilities and the customer's shopping experience. Our SAP implementation in Europe is also on track. We continue to expect our infrastructure investments to create a year-on-year drag of approximately 60 basis points on operating margin in fiscal 2016, largely driven by the critical e-commerce re-platforming investment. Moving to foreign exchange, let me give you an update on our previously announced actions to mitigate the negative currency impacts. We have raised prices for cruise and spring seasons in those markets that have been impacted by currency devaluation, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Europe. These pricing actions are generally in the mid to high single-digit range. Our retail partners have been very receptive to the price increases, and we believe our competitors are implementing pricing actions as well. We expect to see the benefits on our income statement in the back half of the fiscal year. In addition, we continue to expect lower product cost in the back half of the fiscal year from lower raw material and oil prices. With that as backdrop, I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. We are maintaining our outlook for the fiscal year. We continue to expect mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth for the full year. This will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives in which we have invested over the last several years. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale. And based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have about a 450 basis point negative impact on fiscal 2016 revenue growth. Moving to operating income, on a constant currency basis, we expect an improvement in operating margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2016. We intend to reinvest this improvement in our infrastructure build-out, primarily the new global e-commerce platform and ongoing SAP implementation. On a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year 2016 operating margin to be approximately 180 basis points to 230 basis points below fiscal 2015's levels due to the unfavorable currency impact. This guidance excludes restructuring and other one-time related charges associated with our global brand reorganizations. In terms of the sensitivity on our operating income to movements in exchange rates, a change of about $0.05 in the euro to U.S. dollar rate would impact our operating income by about $20 million on a full year basis. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to grow 3% to 5% in constant currency. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the second quarter to be 550 basis points. Our operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 275 to 325 basis points below the prior-year period, due to negative foreign currency effects, infrastructure investments and timing of expense savings initiatives. The second quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. We are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time. With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that? Operator : The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Morning. Thanks for the update. I wanted to ask my questions around the retail business. The minus 2% comp, sounds like North America is the key driver there. Do you have a sense for what the comp might have looked like if you had chosen to go down the promotional path? And then what are your expectations for the environment? Do you expect the promotionality across retail to moderate and comp store sales trends to resume to more of a positive level? And also an update on the Polo store specifically would be great. Thanks. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. So let me start with the comp trends. It was really a mixed environment that we were operating in around the world with a lot of different factors. So I would start by saying that about 20% of our sales are driven by foreign tourists globally in our retail stores. And you correctly mention that if you look at the international business, our retail comps were positive. So we were up internationally in our retail comps, both in Europe and in Asia. Part of that was driven by strong acceptance of the product. Part of that was driven by increased traffic flows from foreign tourists, particularly in Japan and Europe. In the U.S., the business was under a little bit more pressure, and that was largely driven by the foreign tourist trend. And so I think that's been one of the biggest drivers, as we spoke about previously. With regard to the e-commerce impact, it was a little bit of a different dynamic. So in the e-commerce comps, we saw strong double-digit growth in e-commerce comps in the international business where we continued to operate in a somewhat less promotional environment. In the U.S., as we saw the promotional environment escalating, we chose to stay focused on driving full-price sell-through and increasing the brand equity. And so we chose not to go down the promotional game. And we saw, as a result of that, that our average unit retails were up versus year ago. Our average transaction size was up versus year ago, but we did see a slowdown in the revenue growth as a result. And that's really what held back the overall e-commerce comp growth in the quarter, but we think it was the right move from a long-term perspective in terms of protecting the brand equity. The Polo Fifth Avenue store, I think we continue to be very encouraged about the Polo Fifth Avenue store in terms of the job that it's doing of showcasing the brand aesthetic and brand sensibility. We're continuing to learn in that store based on the consumer response. And we're continuing to adjust the product assortment to not only showcase the direction that the brand is moving with new product, but also getting the product assortments right for that consumer that's walking into the store. So I think we continue to feel very good about where we are with that store. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for a great update. Chris, since you like multipart questions, I want to ask you one here. I know it's been a topic of intense discussion, but fiscal 2017, as we look to our longer-term models particularly on the margins, you guys have a lot of projects going on with varying durations. And as we look at next year, you guys have been commenting with us all intra-quarter on a lot of these things, maybe just an update on a few of the buckets? I think you said e-commerce and SAP are going to peak out in dollar terms this year, maybe not decline next year, but no longer inflationary. There's the restructuring savings, if you could comment on how much of that you think would flow through to margins? Because if all of it did, that would be obviously very impactful to earnings. So want to maybe help us context that. And then currency, I know most competitors now are starting to talk about the lagging impacts of hedges rolling off next year. Maybe you could just help us contextualize that as we look at next year, will FX be a bigger or smaller impact to the margins versus this year? Thanks. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah, sure. So I think you've got the three big elements that you mentioned in the question, but maybe I'll start with FX. So for FX, I think we said on the last call that we expected FX to be a hurt of about $185 million to operating income this year, which effectively accounts for most, if not all, of the margin decline in operating margin this year. If you look at that FX impact this year, about half of that is translational and half of that is transactional. The translational impact of currency rates stay where they are today, we would not have continuing into next fiscal year because we would have fully anniversaried it by the time we get to next fiscal year. We do expect, if FX rates stay where they are today, that we will have a lagging transactional hurt from FX that goes into next year, but we expect the magnitude of that transactional hurt to be slightly smaller than the transactional hurt that we're experiencing this year because of the timing of when our hedges roll off. On the infrastructure investments piece of that, I expect that the e-commerce re-platforming investment is likely to ramp up next year versus this year as we get closer to implementation. And so we're expecting to be spending more money on the e-commerce re-platforming project next year. But on the SAP project, we expect that investment to ramp down year-over-year. And so when you look at the infrastructure investments in total, it's too soon to say exactly how we net out, but probably we'll be in a similar place in fiscal 2017 in total when you look at the two projects together as where we are this year. And then, let's see, the third part of the question was on restructuring. And on restructuring savings, I think we've said that we expect to have a portion of the savings this year and a much more significant portion of the savings next year. So I do expect the restructuring savings to be a help to operating margin next year in a meaningful way. But obviously, how that nets out against the currency impact, I think it's still premature for us to say. Operator : Thank you. The next question's from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good morning. I wondered if you could be a little bit more specific about some of the promotional pressure that you saw during the quarter, how that differed quarter-over-quarter, what categories were more promotional than other categories, and finally how it differed between your wholesale partners and your own retail stores. Thank you. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. So I guess I'd characterize it by we didn't really see a change in promotional pressure in the international business. So what we're talking about here is really the U.S. business and the U.S. retail and wholesale environment. And I think as Jacki mentioned in the prepared remarks, what we saw was with the West Coast port slowdown, with the unseasonably cold winter, there was an overhang generally of product in the industry that resulted in a desire to clear some of that inventory across the industry. And that led to a number of our wholesale partners as well as a number of our branded competitors going deeper and more frequent in their promotional cadence than what they had done a year ago. And so I think we felt good about the way that we navigated through that because we tried to navigate through that in a way that both protected our brand equity and dealt with the market realities from a competitive environment. And I think we've got a strong track record of being able to navigate through those types of short-term issues both protecting the brand and dealing with the market realities that we're facing. Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: And we saw it broadly across pretty much every product category. In the men's business, the women's business and the children's business as well the home business. So it seemed to have affected all businesses in a very similar way. None of our businesses stood out in any specific way. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : The one other comment I would make on that is we also saw that the foreign tourist decline to the U.S. also I think was a contributing factor that affected the whole industry in terms of inventory levels and promotional environment. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you very much. Two questions, one, Jacki, if you can give us an update, obviously accessories is a big growth initiative for the company, that category seems to be getting more challenging, and the progress you're making toward growth in that business. And then secondly, if you look across your U.S. wholesale business, historically you guys have talked about here a low to mid-single digit growth. And I'm just wondering given the more challenging season that we just went through, whether you can still expect that kind of bookings and growth as we head through and into next year. Thank you. Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Yes. Well, our accessory category continues to grow faster than our overall company average. So we're really seeing very good momentum, both for our Ralph Lauren brand and our Lauren and Polo brands. And we've grown our accessory business at a 20% CAGR since 2008, and that really, today, represents a high-single-digit percentage of our total sales. We're seeing strength in both handbags and footwear, and our international full-price sell-throughs have been extremely strong, both in men's, women's and across footwear and accessories. So we're seeing great traction in the world of Ricky. We have double-digit sales growth this year in that category. So we're really continuing to fuel that opportunity and we're expanding that line through new colors, silhouettes and materials. With the introduction of the Ricky Drawstring, we've had great success with that and are expanding that as well. In the U.S. wholesale business, I think the low to mid-single is something that we are comfortable with, and we continue to perform at or better than the customer. So I think that particularly with some of our new introductions in our Polo Sport opportunity that we're just in the beginning stages of this month, the continuation of Polo Women's, so I think we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us in terms of some of these new introductions. The Denim & Supply business has been extremely strong. Denim, as a foundation of that business, has continued to grow and strengthen and we are feeling that in the undercurrents of that business and we play strongly in that category across Polo, across our women's business, in Polo Women's in particular, our Lauren brand, and so that category and Polo Men's as well. So I think that category we see as an increasing strong part of our opportunity going forward as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Hello. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about inventory levels in the channel and your comfort with your own inventory levels. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure, yeah. We saw our inventory was up about 8% at the end of the quarter, and we feel very comfortable with the inventory levels in the content of that inventory. If you look at the inventory at the end of the quarter and what drove the increase, it really was impacted by the timing of receipt plans as well as getting ready for the launch of Polo Sport, the expansion of Polo Women's and the opening of new stores. So when we look at the underlying factors that we're getting ready for going forward, we feel very confident and comfortable with the inventory content and level. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on two things. Number one, Jacki, you commented that you saw business pick up at the beginning of the quarter. I was hoping you could just put a little more color around channel, region or where you saw some of the strengthening. And then second, if you could just go through in a bit more detail the drivers of your EBIT margin outlook, what are the kind of bucket, the key drivers of compression or where you're seeing any offset for your Q2 outlook? Thanks. Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: I think that from our perspective, we saw a strengthening in our e-commerce business. We saw a strengthening in our overall retail business. And while the first month of our quarter tends to be more promotional, because that's just the nature of the July timing, we started to also see a strengthening of the full-price business. As we continue to sell down whatever sale we had left at this point, we also saw a nice uptick in our full-price business across the board. So I think, pretty much across all of our segments, we saw a nice increase. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : And if you look at the EBIT margin or the operating margin compression in the second quarter, I think it's really driven by the way that the fiscal year lays out. So in the second quarter, we're still impacted in a significant way by foreign exchange and we're impacted by the investments in the infrastructure investment, the e-commerce and the SAP investments. But we don't yet have the benefit, which we expect to start getting in the back half of the year, of the pricing actions that we've taken to offset the foreign exchange; the cost reductions that we've negotiated with our manufacturing and sourcing partners, which flow more directly into the back half of the year; the beginning of the restructuring savings, which we expect to flow more in the back half of the year; as well as the benefit of new store openings, which we expect to be more pronounced in the back half of the year. We also expect the foreign exchange impact to be smaller in the fourth quarter. And so I think the second quarter is still bearing the brunt of all of the foreign exchange and the infrastructure investments without the benefit of the actions that we've taken to offset that, which we expect to flow more into Q3 and Q4. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Swinand with Morningstar. Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask, some of our investors have said with all this restructuring, is there any chance that there could be damage to the brand in the long run and is there any way you can give us some color or assurance that \u2013 I mean I think it could actually be positive for the brand, but could you explain that, maybe? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. I think we believe that this is going to be very positive for the brands as we move into the new structure, because effectively what we're doing is we're going to be focused in creating organizations that are single-mindedly focused by brand at driving the brand equity and brand consistency around the world. So one of the reasons that we've moved into this model was that, as we looked at our previous operating model, as we started to take back licenses from the different geographies and license partners around the world, what we found was that we had different merchandise assortments around the world in like locations. We had a fragmented set of marketing campaigns because of that disparate assortments around the world. And we think, by moving to this global brand structure with the global line planning process, we're going to be able to drive a more consistent look and feel of the brand, more consistent marketing campaigns. And that's going to drive an improvement in brand equity, which we think will allow us to showcase more clearly the design vision of the brand in all of the locations that consumers interact with our products around the world. Operator : Thank you. The next question's from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. So from a margin perspective, the retail operating margins have been negative, say, the past six quarters straight. As we move forward, and if you try to parse out foreign exchange, I guess I'm trying to dig in, what kind of retail comp do you think you need to see the fixed cost deleverage either stabilize or actually turn to leverage in the model? And then separately, excluding the Easter receipt shift, would operating margins at wholesale have actually been up this quarter? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : So let me take the second piece first. So the Easter shift accounted for about $50 million or so of revenue shift between Q4 and Q1. So if you looked at the wholesale business between Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, if you put those two together, the wholesale business globally would have been up 2% in constant currency. And if you look at the wholesale business just in Q1 without the Easter shift, the wholesale business would have been up marginally even in the first quarter on a standalone basis without that Easter shift impact. The Easter shift really accounted for all of the margin compression, effectively, in the wholesale business. So we don't think that there is an underlying trend issue with regard to margin compression in wholesale that we're seeing. If you look back to the first part of your question, which is around the retail comp trend, I think the margin compression that we're seeing this year is really a function of foreign exchange more than a function of retail comps. And so I don't think we've got an issue that we're relying on significant retail comp growth in order to drive operating leverage going forward. I think we believe we can drive operating leverage going forward even in a environment of relatively muted retail comp growth. That being said, we're shooting to try to improve our retail comp figures going forward and we think that the global brand structure is going to play a key role in that process. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I've got two questions. The first, the press release mentioned in the last 90 days the company established six global brand groups and filled a lot of roles. What's the next step? Can you set up a roadmap for us for what to look for over the next 90 days? And then the other question is on Polo Women's. Polo shirts, khakis, underwear are such staples in the Polo Men's business. Can those categories also be staples in women's Polo? And if not, what's really going to drive Polo Women's from a product perspective? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. So I'll take the brand part of the question. So over the next 90 days, what we're expecting with the global brand groups is to get the balance of the teams formed. We've made good progress. As I mentioned, we've filled all the president roles. We've made good progress on many of the key leadership positions in those, but we still have work to do to finalize the entirety of those brand structures. We also are beginning a strategy process in each of the global brand groups to look at what the global strategy is for that and we expect to make progress on that in the next 90 days. We won't be complete on that, but we're going to make significant process. The other key piece, which I spoke about in the prepared remarks, is the global line planning process, which we expect to have kicked off, at least initiated, in almost all of the brand groups over the course of the next 90 days. We're starting with men's Polo for the fall 2016 season. We kicked off that pilot in May. And so that group got a head start, which we have learned a significant amount from, and I think we're very encouraged by what we're seeing from that line planning process approach. And I think we'll begin to kick off in many of the other brands for the spring 2017 season and those kick-offs of that process will happen in the next 90 days. Jackwyn L. Nemerov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: On the women's Polo business, you're absolutely right, but what's so interesting about the women's business is that we're finding key core categories in Polo Women's that are as meaningful as those categories in Polo Men's. Starting off with items like our cable cashmere sweater, in the spring season we do a cotton version, those categories have performed extremely well. We have a great Polo shirt business that is consistent and strong in women's. We do, similar to men's, an expanded woven shirt business that we are really known for and that crisp shirt, whether it is the white shirt or multiple stripes and checks and so forth, also are as valuable in women's to us as they are in men's. And then, of course, we have key bottoms, if not the chino pant. But for us, the DNA is around our jogger (49:59), which continues to perform extremely well, as well as well as our cargo pant, another key thing that we are known for that have been extremely important and powerful as key bottoms statement. So while the women's business is driven certainly by fashion, we're able to augment that with these key strategies. Our signature blazer also is part of that core strategy. So in women's, it's more of a balance, but we have multiple staples that travel through our Polo Women's business that are important to us. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Okay. Thank you very much for dialing in today. I think we're very pleased with the start that we've had to the fiscal year in the first quarter. We're maintaining our outlook for the year and we're excited about the progress that we're making on the global brand management reorganization. As always, Evren, Bob and myself will be available for follow-up calls, and Jacki as needed. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead. Evren Kopelman - Investor Relations : Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's second quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. The agenda for this morning's call includes opening remarks from Stefan Larsson, the company's new Chief Executive Officer; an overview of the quarter, and an update on key strategic initiatives from Christ Peterson, President of Global Brands; followed by financial perspective on the second quarter as well as expectations for fiscal 2016 from Bob Madore, Chief Financial Officer. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Stefan. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Evren. Good morning, everyone. It's a true pleasure to be on the call this morning. I want to start by thanking Ralph and the board for the trust that they have put in me to become the CEO and work by Ralph's side to grow this great company into the future. I also want to take the opportunity and thank Chris and the whole Ralph Lauren team for the great work they have done in creating a very strong foundation to build on. This is a really, really great company. Ralph's dreams and vision about a better life, about style, about great quality, about specialness, story-telling, have built the brand into one of the most beloved brands in the world. It started with the idea about a different tie and it grew to become one of the most iconic brands in the world. This is my first week at the company. I have a lot to learn. The first week started with a board meeting and then an analyst call. I'm excited by that. I will spend my next few months in the role getting to know our teams, our customers, and our investors. For those of you who don't know me, I set the bar for performance really high. For 15 years, I was a part of the team that grew H&M from $3 billion to $17 billion. Most recently, I led Old Navy, where we drove three consecutive years of high performance and we added $1 billion in sales. Ralph and I share the same focus on striving for greatness. We never settle, and we love winning, and my job is to make sure we deliver on Ralph's creative vision and drive performance on the highest of levels, from both a brand, customer, and shareholder perspective. I joined because I believe in Ralph. I believe in his vision. I believe it's more relevant than any time before. I believe in the brands. I believe in the teams. And together with Ralph and the team, I look forward to continue to grow this unique company over many years to come. So with that, over to you Chris. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Thanks, Stefan and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting better-than-expected second quarter results this morning. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4%, and diluted earnings per share was up 13% versus a year ago, excluding one-time charges. Profits were significantly better than our expectations entering the quarter driven by stronger-than-expected operating margins. This was driven by both gross margin and SG&A improvement. On gross margins, we are beginning to benefit from the initial phases of the SKU and style rationalization, lower negotiated source income cost, increased full-price sell-throughs and mix benefits. SG&A was also significantly better than forecast due to earlier-than-expected cost savings from the global brand reorganization and disciplined expense management. We are pleased to see margin benefits from these initiatives already and expect to see topline benefits as well as the new global line planning process is implemented. Now let me provide an overview of the quarter. We continued to see the impact of currency movements on foreign tourist traffic around the world. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced foreign tourist traffic in the U.S., while the weaker euro and Japanese yen had the opposite effect in those markets. In Europe, our revenue was up double-digits in constant currency similar to the first quarter. Growth was driven by increased sales to both local customers and tourists. Wholesale demand was particularly strong, with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. All brands across the portfolio performed well and by region, Northern and Central Europe performed the best. In Asia, second quarter revenue was up 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in Japan, China, Southeast Asia, and Australia. We are successfully elevating our brand in these markets through targeted merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives. Full-price selling is up year-over-year, driving better sales and margins. We are achieving market share gains through success with local customers as well as increased tourist traffic. Korea, Hong Kong and Macau all were negatively impacted by reduced tourist traffic. In Korea, trends started to improve as the lingering effect of the MERS outbreak diminished. In the Americas, net revenue was up 2% in constant currency. Sales trends were impacted by the continued decline of traffic to both our retail stores and department stores, driven by lower foreign tourist traffic and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season. Within our retail store network, we were able to partially offset the traffic declines by driving increased conversion through successful merchandising strategies and marketing initiatives. Our global e-commerce sales were up 10% in the second quarter, driven by our international business. In North America e-commerce, we saw improved trends compared to the first quarter. We made several enhancements in our omnichannel capabilities including the launch of Buy Online Ship from Store and Hold Online pickup in Store and a new feature where customers can be added to a waitlist if we are sold out of a size or color. We also added product videos that are driving a higher average order value. Within the global factory outlet channel, results were mixed. Europe saw increased traffic and conversion rates leading to strong comp store sales growth. The U.S. continued to see traffic declines due to fewer foreign tourists. Importantly, in the U.S. in locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic, we achieved positive comps driven by improved conversion rates that were the result of successful marketing and in-store initiatives. As we plan the second half of fiscal 2016, we are taking a prudent approach given the slow start to fall in the U.S. fueled by unseasonably warm weather and continued declines in foreign tourist traffic. We believe inventory in the North America department store channel is elevated and as a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. Bob will share more details on our second half guidance. Now let me provide an update on our key strategic initiatives starting with the transition to our new global brand management structure. We made excellent progress in the quarter with all six brand presidents and their leadership teams now in place, our new global line planning process well underway, and the clarification of decision rights across brands, regions and channels. The global line planning process is one of the most important elements of the new operating model as it impacts the way we design, merchandise and plan our assortments. The Men's Polo brand successfully piloted this new process as the team planned for the fall of 2016 season. The team began with input from the regions and channels and the view of the successes and opportunities of the prior season. This led into category and classification strategies to start the design process. When the new line was completed several weeks ago, the positive impact of the process was evident, yielding significant product innovation, greater global brand consistency, and style and SKU reductions. For example, for fall 2016, Polo will feature lighter weight fabrics and a more wear-now sensibility for warm weather stores and early deliveries in northern climate stores. There will also be more elevated product, including more sport coats and dress furnishings as these elements have seen strong sales in our retail stores. We expect a double-digit reduction in SKUs compared to the same season last year and this is on top of the reduction we achieved in fall 2015. So, we are very encouraged by this progress. We will be rolling out the global line planning process to other brands over the coming weeks as we kick off the design and development process for the spring 2017 season, and we believe there will be tremendous benefit across our portfolio. The success of the Men's Polo pilot has led to enthusiasm and confidence among the brand teams as to the benefits this new way of working will have on the strength of our assortments and the efficiency of our operation. We continue to expect a significant reduction in SKUs and sample and design cost which will lead to better inventory turns, higher gross margins, and meaningful SG&A cost savings across the brand portfolio over the next 18 months to 24 months. We've also initiated a new global brand strategic planning process that will be completed over the next few months. This will be the first time we will have a holistic strategic view by brand across all geographies and channels of distribution. We are raising our estimate for annual expense savings associated with the restructure to $110 million from $100 million, given the progress we have made in the global brand restructuring effort, as well as incremental store closures we have identified. As a result, we expect a higher restructuring charge of $120 million to $150 million versus our previous estimate of $70 million to $100 million. This increase also includes the impact of recent management changes and one-time charges primarily related to litigation settlements. Turning to our direct-to-consumer growth strategy, we are expanding our reach through new store openings and elevating our presentation through renovation activity in our existing fleet. In the second quarter, we renovated our Ralph Lauren store in South Coast Plaza, which will reopen shortly, and we will be starting renovations at our Beverly Hills flagship store. These activities will reinforce our luxury presence and elevate our positioning in the Los Angeles market. For Polo, we opened five new directly operated stores in the quarter, including two in the U.S. and three in Asia. We also made progress with re-positioning select stores to either Ralph Lauren Luxury or the Polo Concept in North America. We expect this effort to drive better alignment and clarity by brand as well as improved store productivity and efficiency. Across all brands and concepts, we opened 14 directly operated stores in the second quarter, as well as several licensed locations and concessions. This brings us to a total of 20 new directly operated stores for the first half of the year. And we are on track to open 40 to 50 new stores for fiscal 2016, which will provide mid-single digit square footage growth taking into account planned store closings. Let me turn to some product highlights for the quarter. We previously announced the clarification of our luxury product offering through the merging of Women's and Men's Black Label into Ralph Lauren Collection and Purple Label. The first season of the merged line is delivering now, and the reception is very positive. We are already seeing the efficiencies of this strategy through a reduction in product development and sample costs, and we expect a strong selling season. In our accessories business, we continue to gain momentum with our iconic Ricky Collection in both existing and new silhouettes and styles. We also saw double-digit comp growth in scarves, jewelry and belts, and are continuing to focus on these categories for disproportionate growth. Now let me turn to Polo Sport which launched in our retail stores and select department stores worldwide in August and was followed in October by a launch in 75 top DICK'S Sporting Goods stores and on dickssportinggoods.com. We kicked off the launch with the introduction of the PoloTech Shirt at the U.S. Open tennis tournament. The shirt which features industry-leading advancements in wearable technology has already generated more than 3.1 billion media impressions and continues to receive strong editorial attention. This was followed by powerful video content leveraged across all distribution channels. The early read on Polo Sport is positive, and we have already incorporated initial learning from this first season into go-forward development. We believe Polo Sport will be a significant business for us as consumers' growing desire for performance and athleisure product fits perfectly with the DNA of the Polo brand. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made this year and we are confident in the company's potential for future growth. We believe that the new global brand management operating model will allow us to more fully leverage the power of our brands, and we continue to make thoughtful strategic decisions to minimize the impact of near-term market realities and maximize shareholder returns over time. Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me say that we are all excited to have Stefan joining as our new CEO. And on behalf of Ralph, myself and the entire senior management team, we would like to recognize and thank Jackwyn Nemerov for all of her contributions over the past 11 years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a brief recap of the quarter. Second quarter net revenues were up 4% to the prior year on a constant currency basis driven by double-digit revenue growth internationally as well as the contribution of new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. This is in line with the guidance we provided of 3% to 5% constant currency growth in August. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 500 basis points, largely in line with the expectations. On a reported basis, net revenues declined 1% to $2 billion in the second quarter. Gross profit margin was 56.5% in the second quarter. This was 30 basis points below the prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. On a constant currency basis, gross margin was up 90 basis points compared to the prior year due to lower negotiated sourcing costs, benefit from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, increased full-price selling and mix benefits. Operating margin in the second quarter was 13.5% excluding one-time charges, 90 basis points below the prior year. This is significantly better than the outlook we provided of 275-basis-point to 325-basis-point decline in August. The operating margin was favorable to our guidance due to better than expected gross margin, cost savings from the global brand organization plan and disciplined expense management. The lower operating margin to the prior year was attributable to negative foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure. Net income for the second quarter was $184 million or $2.13 per diluted share, excluding one-time charges. Earnings per share grew 13% to the prior year period, excluding foreign currency impacts and one-time charges. On a reported basis, net income was $160 million or $1.86 per diluted share in the second quarter. The effective tax rate of 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis was slightly below our guidance of 30% due to discrete tax items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior-year period. Moping on to segment performance, wholesale revenues increased 3% in constant currency in the second quarter. Wholesale revenue was supported by double-digit constant currency growth in Europe with the strength across all brands. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues of $927 million were 2% below the prior-year period. Wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.8% excluding one-time charges. This was 60 basis points above the prior-year period, driven by gross margin improvement and disciplined expense management. Retail sales increased 5% in constant currency, to $996 million in the second quarter. Growth was driven by incremental contribution from new stores and strong global e-commerce growth. Comparable store sales declined 1% in constant currency and declined 6% on a reported basis. International same store sales were positive with particular strength in Europe, Japan, China, and Australia but comps declined in North America as traffic was pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and the overall retail environment. Our e-commerce trend improved somewhat from last quarter but was offset by our brick-and-mortar comp, which was down 2% to 3%, similar to last quarter. Within e-commerce, our international business continued to post strong double-digit gains. Excluding one-time charges, retail operating margin in the second quarter was 12.8%, which was 80 basis points below the prior-year period, reflecting fixed expense deleverage and negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 7% in constant currency in the second quarter, and licensing operating income was in-line with the prior year period. Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new store openings and increased shipments of Polo Sport and Polo Women's. At the end of the second quarter, we had 32 more directly operated stores and 82 more concessions in the chain than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. We feel comfortable with our inventory levels and the quality of our inventory. Moving on to capital expenditures, we spent $134 million in the second quarter compared to $91 million in the prior-year period. The company also repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter at a cost of $130 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $280 million. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $300 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $727 million of total debt. This reflects the new $300 million senior note offering we completed in August. Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2016. As Chris mentioned, we are taking a prudent approach to planning the balance of the fiscal year. As a result, despite our Q2 beat, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect reported revenues to be approximately flat for the year, driven by a 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth and 400 basis points of negative impact from foreign currency based on current exchange rates. The constant currency growth will be supported by significant contributions from the strategic initiatives which we have invested in over the last several years, as well as the actions we are taking to mitigate negative currency impacts including raising pricing for the spring 2016 season in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia. Retail segment revenues are expected to grow faster than wholesale. As a reminder, we have a 53rd week in fiscal 2016. Moving on to operating income, on a reported basis, we continue to expect our full year, fiscal 2016 operating margin to be approximately 100 basis points to 230 basis points below fiscal year 2015's levels due to unfavorable currency impacts. This guidance excludes one-time charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization. We expect these one-time charges to approximate $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016, of which $38 million was recognized in the second quarter and $83 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. This is higher than the estimate we shared previously of $70 million to $100 million due to inclusion of additional charges associated with the recently announced management changes and additional restructuring activities. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 30%. We are planning approximately $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. For the third quarter fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to grow zero to 2% on a reported basis. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the third quarter to be 250 basis points. Our operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be 200 basis points to 250 basis points below the prior-year period due to negative foreign currency effects and infrastructure investments. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 31%. Overall, we are pleased with the better than expected second quarter results. Disciplined planning and rigorous attention to the day-to-day execution enabled us to offset meaningful FX and environmental headwinds in addition to driving our strategic initiatives forward. With that, we'll open the call up for your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that? Operator : The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning. Nice quarter, guys. Stefan, I know it's your first week, so I'm not going to ask you any detailed questions on the company, but I would love to get your view kind of on the global apparel fashion landscape, how you see it evolving, especially given your experiences at H&M and Old Navy which are two very different brands than Ralph Lauren. And then kind of accordingly, how does that shape your view of what the biggest opportunities are at Ralph Lauren? Thanks. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Omar. And I'll start with \u2013 I hear it as two questions, one being my view on the global landscape. So, I believe that independent of where you're in the market today, in fashion apparel, you have to be special, you have to be unique, you have to be exciting, you have to stand for something, you have to be consistent, you have to focus on quality, you have to focus on the experience, and you have to deliver something great. So that's very much what attracted me when I had that first dinner with Ralph. I realized that this is his vision. This is how he has built this great company and that's why I said in my opening remarks that I believe that vision is more relevant than ever before, given what I see happening out there. And coming to the biggest opportunity \u2013 that connects to me to the biggest opportunities, I believe that Ralph's vision that started with ties and a drawer at the Empire State building and has built into where we stand right now is just a beginning. I believe that there are really good days ahead of us. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter in a tough environment. I guess just two questions. I apologize if they are a little wordy. So, I was a little surprised by the magnitude of the gross margin improvement from the SKU improvement you guys made this early, considering you told us the roll out of the global SKU program will really be only in place for one brand, Polo, I think, by fall of 2016. It sounds like you went through a smaller manual process today and it translated to a lot of improvement. Can you give us any quantitative metrics to help us think about how much you lowered SKUs by this quarter and how that may \u2013 what the magnitude of that is relative to what we're going to see next year in the fall as you roll it out? And then as a follow-up, you've had us focused on some investment buckets for the past few years. You've commented on e-commerce and SAP spend peaking this year. I think you'll have less intensity in flagship openings next year, so maybe the retail investment isn't quite as intense, but maybe if we start adding up those buckets up again, can you give us your early thoughts based on the components as you see them today for your ability to leverage margins in fiscal 2017? Thank you. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. So, let me take the first part of that first. So, I think the results obviously came in significantly better than we expected this quarter when we gave guidance on the quarter and really about \u2013 we beat the operating margin expectation that we had by about 200 basis points. And if you look at that beat, about half of it was due to gross margin and half of it was due to SG&A and it was really a function of a number of items. On the gross margin side, we did see benefits from the SKU and style rationalization and you're right, that we tackled that when we started the global merchandising group about a year or two ago in a manual way. We're just scratching the surface of that, I would say at this point, because the systemic approach to the style and SKU rationalization is really what's coming in the global line planning process which was going to kick in 12 months to 18 months from now. So I would say if you looked at Men's Polo for fall of 2015, we might have been down a low double-digit percentage of styles and SKUs. And then when you look at fall of 2016, we're expecting again, even versus that lower base, another improvement of equal magnitude, and I think on many of the other brands, we've had an initial little bit of a progress, but I think there's more progress ahead of us going forward as we move into the line planning process. We also, on the gross margin side though, benefited from the lower negotiated sourcing costs. If you recall when we took the big foreign exchange hurt back earlier this calendar year, we commissioned our manufacturing and sourcing group to go back to our sourcing and supply chain base, and that sourcing discussion and cost discussion has resulted in average unit cost reductions that came a little bit bigger than we expected and faster. And then we also benefited from improved full-price sell throughs during the quarter. So, all of that kind of went in the positive direction which led to the gross margin improvement. Relative to next fiscal year, I think we are just about to kick off the budgeting process, so it's premature to give guidance on next fiscal year. We'll provide qualitative perspective at our next call but your comment is accurate in that certainly from an infrastructure standpoint, we expect the e-commerce replatforming spend to be higher next year as we ramp up the work on moving to the new e-commerce platform, but we do expect the SAP spending to moderate though. I expect infrastructure in total to not be a significant year-over-year driver. The retail investment also, I don't expect to be a year-over-year driver because we're at about the rate of new store openings that we anticipate going forward. I do think that we're going to see foreign exchange impact next year continuing, primarily on the transactional side, because the hedging program that we had in place this year will roll off over the next 9 months to 12 months, so we'll see a transactional hit although the translational impact should be small to non-existent at current rates. But then we're going to start to see some of the benefits from all of the restructuring work that we've done, both from the global brand restructuring, from the line planning and from the pricing actions that we put in place that should start to roll in over the next 12 months. So, we'll provide more specifics on how all of that nets against each other on the next call but that's where we stand at the moment. Operator : Thank you. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Next call. Operator : The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. You mentioned that the inventory levels at retail and in department stores were elevated a bit. I guess, when you look at the forecast that you laid out for the rest of this fiscal year, can you just walk us through some of the markdown assumptions that you will see necessary and sort of how you're thinking about the markdown support to department stores versus your own retail operations? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. So, I think we feel very good about the currency of our inventory. So when we look at our inventory, the currency of our inventory is very well-positioned from a current season and future season basis versus a prior season inventory. The inventory growth that we've had in our inventory versus year ago is really to support new store activity and new product introductions like Polo Sport around the world. When we look at the U.S. department store channel, I think that's the place where we see a little bit of elevated inventory across the channel that is not just in our business, but broadly defined in many of the competitors. And I think it's a function of the foreign tourist traffic being down in the U.S. as well as the unseasonably warm start to the fall season. And so as we approach the holiday selling period, which is obviously the biggest selling period of the year for our industry, we felt like it was the right thing to take a prudent approach to that given where we're headed. We've got a long history of navigating through this in a very strong way, and we've got real expertise within the company to help us do this. And what we're trying to do is keep our inventory fresh and current, exit the season in a positive way as we transition to the next season, but do that in a way that protects the brand equity in the consumers' eyes. And so that's what we're going to be doing as we've done for many years. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Good morning. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just on the outlook for the back half of the year, why don't you think some of your, excuse me, expense management and lower sourcing costs impacting the back half more? Are there any expenses that shifted out of this quarter into the next quarter, and is the caution on the back half of the year more from the cancelations or the potential for cancelations or more from anticipated markdowns at your wholesale partners? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. So, I think that \u2013 we haven't seen expense shifts that have gone from the second quarter to the third quarter. So, I think we're being prudent given the environment that we see as we head through the back half of the year. So, the guidance for the back half of the year is really more a function of that. We have not seen cancelation in orders. And in fact, if you look broadly across the business, it's really a mixed environment. In Europe, our reorder rate is stronger than it's ever been. And so we're seeing real strength in the wholesale channel in Europe, and we're chasing to catch up with the reorder rate there. In the U.S., I think we're being cautious given the environment that we're facing. We're wanting to manage the markdown allowances in a prudent manner that, as I mentioned on the previous question, positions us well as we exit the fall season and transition into the spring season. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on your Polo retail strategy, obviously it's one of your key growth pillars. The Men's business is obviously a very well-established business in wholesale and retail. Women's in Polo is a newer business, I presume, to attract a younger consumer. Can you share with us your learning so far and what, if any, repositioning you have to do from an assortment perspective, maybe from casual to dressier or how are you feeling about the Polo Women's business and is this still just an important growth initiative as it was positioned certainly over the last year? Thank you. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. No, you're exactly right. So, we feel very good about the Polo Men's business which is historically one of the strongest businesses in the company. The Polo Women's business, we launched I guess about a year ago and we've seen what I would say as good results to date. The business has been stronger internationally than it has in the U.S. as we've started off. In the international markets in Europe and in Asia, we largely replaced a Blue Label business that was discontinued and we took many of the locations that were Blue Label locations and converted them to Women's Polo locations. And that business, the Women's Polo business, has now not only surpassed the size of the Blue Label business, but at price points that are below where Blue Label was. So, the unit velocity of the Polo Women's business internationally is more than double the unit velocity rate of the Blue Label business. And we see significant expansion opportunities for distribution of Women's Polo around the world. In the U.S., where we didn't have a very well-developed Blue Label business, we launched Women's Polo in incremental spaces into the marketplace. I think we're off to a good start in that business. We see it as a critical element of the company's future growth strategy, and we're working to take learnings from the initial seasons and develop them into the line as part of the line planning process that we're kicking off for Women's Polo as we go forward. So, I think we're encouraged by the start that we've had, but there's more to do, and certainly a lot more opportunity ahead of us, because, as you know, the Women's fashion and apparel business is bigger than Men's. And with the strength of the Polo brand and the strength of Polo Men's, we continue to see a big opportunity in Polo Women's. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the line planning process and what kind of changes you're making there. If you could talk about sort of how far into the 2016 design season you are now, and where the real opportunities are for improvement of the design process and the cleaning up of the design process? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we started with a pilot of the line planning process on the Men's Polo line, which is our biggest line for fall of 2016, and we've now largely completed that pilot process. And it's interesting because the way that we did the pilot process is we started with a hindsighting approach of looking at prior seasons. We also then engaged all of the region and channel leaders around the world to bring in consumer input and feedback into develop \u2013 which we used to develop category and classification strategies and develop specific targets for price points, margins, SKUs by category and classification which then led to an architecture that we handed off to the design community. And I have to say the design community did an outstanding job of using that feedback and designing a line that is very compelling. So that line that was designed has now been shared back with the regions and the channel teams and the response from the region and channel teams has been terrific to the design community's progress in terms of product innovation. I'm not going to talk about all of the product innovation at this point because I don't want to give away too much of our secrets. But I referenced a couple of the items that you're going see as we move into the fall 2016 Men's Polo line. You are going to see us having lighter weight fabrics, a more wear-now sensibility. About half of the Polo distribution is in warm weather climate locations. And we felt like we had a big opportunity to design into that so that both for the early part of the fall season in the Northern climate stores, and the majority of the fall season in the warm climate stores we had product that was more compelling, more innovative and more attractive for those target locations. And I think we've delivered on that. And there's a series of themes like that that you're going to see as we go through that. So that's where we are really for the fall process on the line planning process. We're really kicking off the line planning process for the spring 2017 season for the majority of the balance of the brands and categories. And so, I expect that we'll see similar results for the spring 2017 season as we get through the process on the other brands. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Patel with Stephens. Rick Patel - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Nice quarter, and Stefan great to have you on the call. I have a question on e-commerce. So it seems like you did quite well globally, but if I recall correctly, there were some significant competitor promotions in the last quarter. I'm curious if they continued and perhaps limited the upside for this channel. And then secondly, just a question on e-commerce margins. Because it's managed by partners right now, but as you go live with your own websites in the coming years, what kind of margin uptick should we expect from bringing it in-house? Thank you. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. So the global e-commerce revenue was up 10% in the second quarter, and this compared to the 2% increase we had in the first quarter. So we were encouraged by the acceleration of revenue growth in the e-commerce channel. I think that we continue to stay true to our promotional cadence, where as I mentioned on the last call, we decided to pull back a little bit in terms of the amount of business that we were doing on sale. But what we had this quarter were some omni-channel initiatives like buy online ship from store, hold online pick up in store, the new wait list functionality and product videos that drove higher average order value and the combination of those new omni-channel initiatives I think is what drove the return to stronger growth. And that was true both out internationally, but also true in the North America e-commerce business. Relative to the profitability, today we pay eBay Enterprise or the formerly GSI a percent of revenue for the service that they're providing on \u2013 that's a percent of e-commerce revenue. In addition to that, we're incurring charges associated with insourcing the platform. Once we convert off of the GSI platform to our insourced platform, that GSI fee will go to zero and so we're effectively double paying if you will today for both in-house and outsourced capability. We expect to convert off of the eBay, GSI platform over the next 12 months to 18 months. So I think you'll see us double paying for a 12-month to 18-month period and then you'll see us start to generate the benefit after that. The other point I would make is we expect the insourced capability and cost to be lower than the GSI fee that we're paying. So it's not just that we're getting more capability but we're getting more capability at a lower going cost structure. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask two quick ones. First, you've talked about price increases that you took \u2013 high single digit price increases that you took on products sold overseas, and I know that that product doesn't really hit the shelves until the spring season, but I was curious if you had any read. I know your customers have generally accepted the price increases. If there's any read that gives you more or less confidence that consumers will also accept them? And then, second, Chris, if you could just touch on, now that you're actually seeing some of the benefits from the work you've been doing over the last several quarters in improving efficiencies, line planning, SKU reduction and all that sort of stuff, whether you have sort of fresh perspective on what the margin recovery opportunity is for the business over the longer term as all of these things that you sound so encouraged by and all the long-term opportunity to improve efficiency really comes through? Thanks. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Sure. Let me start with the price increase question. So, I think, it's a little bit early to talk about the consumer reaction to the price increase, but I'll give you a little bit of what we're seeing, and it's encouraging, because we did see, and as you know, we took sort of mid- to high-single digit price increases in the \u2013 to respond to the currency devaluation in Europe, in Canada, in Japan and in Australia, which were the markets that were the most affected by devaluation. In Europe, which is the largest market that we've taken price increases in, we still haven't got the product on the floor in front of consumers, but we have gone through a wholesale market with the higher prices, and what we've seen from that market from wholesale orders is that the wholesale orders have been actually in line with our previous growth rate in terms of unit volume. And so the pricing has come on top of the unit volume, and so we're encouraged by that from a sell-in perspective where we're seeing that the pricing isn't a barrier to strong sell-in in the wholesale channel. We're also hearing that many of the competitors are taking pricing in the market as well. But we don't yet have the consumer read of what is the consumer reaction when that product shows up on the retail and wholesale floors. I expect that we'll get some early indication of that over the next three months or so. And then on the question on longer term margin, certainly we're very encouraged by the line planning work that we've done, the SKU reduction opportunity, the global brand reorganization from a cost savings, and from a efficiency of operation. I think, it's a little bit too soon to say what that means for longer term margins, but certainly we believe all of these things can contribute to a margin improvement story over the next three years to five years. And so we're very much shooting for an operating margin improvement story over that time period as many of these initiatives begin to take hold. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Congrats on a nice quarter. So as we think about the go forward constant currency revenues, aside from the mid-single digit square footage growth which should continue, what's the best way to think about steady state, North America and Europe wholesale growth versus retail comps, again, in more of a steady state environment if we ever see one? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. So, you know, I think that we would like to return to a steady state environment, but we're not counting on returning to a steady state environment. So, I think, we're trying to manage the business in a volatile period where we are seeing significant moves in tourist traffic around the world. I do think if you look at Europe and the U.S. combined from a wholesale perspective, I think our view is that that channel is going to grow at sort of a low single-digit rate. We continue to believe that we can grow market share in that channel by entering new product categories and innovating on our product lines, so we think we might be able to grow a couple of points faster than the channel as we gain market share which we've pretty consistently done over the last 5 years to 10 years. And then I think our direct-to-consumer strategy of e-commerce and retail expansion is likely to remain a disproportionate growth driver for us going forward. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Stefan, I want to ask you just a little bit more about your answer you gave to the first question. At Old Navy, you talked a lot about how aspirational is becoming mass-pirational, in that the democratization of fashion was a big reason that Old Navy was becoming more successful. Can you talk about how the Ralph Lauren and Polo brands can navigate through that environment and how, you know, what your vision is to keep the brand special and continue to perform well? Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, Jay. I'll start with saying that I have a lot to learn. And what I already know though is that there are things happening out there, bigger changes in the environment, than ever before over the last 50 years in fashion apparel. And one change that I see is that the customer wants something special, and it has to be unique and there has to be a story. And you hear a lot of brands speaking about story telling. And then you can look back at what Ralph and the team has done. It's been years before anybody else in telling real stories, inviting customers into movie, sharing a dream of a better life. So I believe that there is a real strength in that going forward as well. And then I have to come back to you when it comes to after I've learned more about the brands, the consumer, the market, and started to work with the team here on crafting and \u2013 out, refining the growth strategy that we already have. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me okay? Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Great. I just wanted to \u2013 speed is a competitive advantage that certainly both of you have addressed. And Chris, just want to know how far along do you feel the business is currently in your speed initiative? And Stefan, what competencies of speed in your former jobs do you think could be brought over to Ralph Lauren over time? And, Chris, how do you see this as a margin enhancer also? Thank you. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. So I'll start and then I'll let Stefan finish. I think that part of what we're doing by moving to the global brand structure is about speed of decision making and speed of execution in the market. Because when you have a centralized point of view by brand that, with all of the functional groups represented as part of the brand team, it allows us to move in a faster way. I will say that we're not yet there from a moving as fast as I think we could in some areas, and a lot of that's because we're just at the beginning of the global brand structure. The global brand teams have been in place now for only a couple of months, and so I think they're both getting up to speed on the business, implementing line plans for the first time, developing brand strategies, we're starting to get brand financial reporting up to enable those teams to really manage the business on a more real-time basis, and so I think we're making progress, but there's more work to do. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Yes, and to build on what Chris said, and hi, Dana. I believe speed is important, I've received questions throughout my career on speed. I believe it has to be grounded in an original idea. So when I look at what Ralph and the team have done to build the company to where it stands right now is based on an authentic idea. And so it's about being authentic and it's being \u2013 it's about being current at the same time. And that's part of the changes I see in the market, and that's part of why I'm very excited to be here, because Ralph has created something original, and \u2013 and being very authentic to that, and working with the team to being more and more and more authentic. But at the same time making sure that we are current. So it's finding those two components and that will deliver something that the consumer will be excited about, and that will drive growth over time. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Okay. Thank you very much for joining this morning, and we will look forward to following up with you for additional questions, as always, as appropriate. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead. Evren Kopelman - Investor Relations : Good morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's third quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. With me today are Stefan Larsson, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Christ Peterson, President of Global Brands; and Bob Madore, Chief Financial Officer. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Stefan. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to meet with you today. I'm here to share with you how I spent my first three months, my initial observations, and a rough outline for how we will build the long term growth plan for this great company. Chris and Bob will then share financial results for the quarter and give you guidance going forward. I will then come back again to conclude the presentation part of the call and open up for your questions. But before we get going, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ralph and the Board for their partnership and trust that they have given me in leading this great company forward. Now, let's start with how I spent my first three months in the role. Over the last 90 days, I've done a lot of travels. I've been to London, Paris, Geneva, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and all over the U.S., including our Distribution Center in North Carolina. I've also met with our biggest customers and spent time with many influencers in the industry, and I met with thousands of our team members across all the functions and levels of the organization. And in many of these meetings, I've received direct feedback from frontline team members and customers. The goal of the travel and meetings has been to learn as much as possible about our brand, our team, our customers and the environment we compete in. Parallel to the travel and meetings, the senior management team is in the process of conducting a formal and comprehensive assessment of our entire organization and every function we do. This review goes beyond the cost savings initiatives and brand planning processes that were underway when I joined; covers all the value creators in the business from brand, product, marketing, to supply chain distribution, geographies, as well as customers and competitors. This assessment and our multi-year growth strategy will be completed in the coming weeks and months. And I look forward to sharing that with you in late spring. While it's still early days in the assessment, a picture is starting to develop of our strengths and opportunities, as well as a rough outline for how we would build our long term growth plan. So, let me start with our strengths. Our brand, our team, and the infrastructure we are building are by far our biggest strengths. Our brand is very strong and unique. Ralph and the team have built a brand on a dream of an aspirational life, in a way it's the quintessential American dream, but it's bigger than that. It's a life in style that goes far beyond apparel. It's built on authentic style, quality, and specialness. And it became the customers' dream, and at its best is both highly aspirational and highly relatable at the same time. Right after I came in, we did a comprehensive brand study that confirms not surprisingly, that our customers see our brand as one of the strongest in the industry. The strength, depth and uniqueness of our brand that Ralph created 48 years ago is a very strong platform to build on. Another key strength we have is our team. Our team members, and I've met many of them already, are highly dedicated, they're passionate and they care deeply about our brand. They can't wait to get back to consistently beating our competitors and there is a hunger for change that will be critical for realizing the full potential of this company. Finally, the infrastructure we are investing in, like SAP and our new e-commerce platform that will enable us to have best-in-class digital capabilities, that's especially important in the world we're living in today. Moving to our opportunities, and here I want to start with our performance trend over the last several years. Our recent financial performance has not been living up to the strengths of our brand. It's been very disappointing on both on a top and a bottom line level. With this underwhelming performance, we're asking ourselves the tough questions needed to identify where the opportunities are to get back to leveraging our strengths to consistently drive higher performance. In our assessment work, we started by asking the following questions, starting with brand. With our multiple brands, how do we increase focus on the brands where we have the biggest opportunity to win? Even though our brand is strong, how do we build on the authentic core of what we stand for and continuously evolve it? Relating to product and assortment, how do we improve the balance in our assortment? Do we have a systematic way of continuously strengthening our assortment? Relating to marketing, how do we focus our resources on cutting through in today's market? How do we evolve our brand voice in a way that makes our brand DNA stand out, and excites and surprises the customer more than anyone else? We want our customers to love us more than anyone else. Relating to supply chain and inventory management, how do we shorten our lead times to be disruptive? How do we optimize our inventory in relation to sales? Relating to distribution and international expansion, how do we improve the quality of our distribution to be able to grow with higher full-price selling and lower discount levels? How do we strengthen our direct-to-consumer channels given where the market is going? How do we make our online channel show up the way it should and drive brand strength and profitable sales growth at the same time? How do we pursue our global growth potential in a much more strategic way? Relating to cost structure, how do we make the cost structure competitive with our best competitors? How do we make sure that we invest in a disciplined enough way for the future to give us the highest return on investment? Relating to customers. How do we get closer to our customers to know what their aspiration, wants and needs are? How do we engage and build enough long-term relationships with our customers? And finally, relating to the increasingly-disruptive environment we're in. How do we strengthen the brand and develop the business model fast enough to succeed in an increasingly disruptive world? Finding the right answers to these type of questions, putting action in place to drive execution will be the most important work we have in front of us over the next few months. It will be the foundation to building our growth plan. Even though our complete plan will not be ready until the end of spring, I would like to share some thinking on where we're driving tourists and how we're going to build up the plan. We are working towards a vision centered on becoming the most admired, aspirational and high-performing style brand in the world. And we will measure our progress towards the vision through brand strength, profitable sales growth, and shareholder return. The foundation of our plan will be our commitment and focus on developing our brand, our teams and our customers. There will be two main parts to our plan framework. The first will be the customer facing part of the brand where we will evolve and strengthen the products, the marketing, and the shopping experience. The second part will be to radically strengthen the underlying business engines. These engines will include developing a systematic repeatable way of creating a stronger and stronger assortment, a more demand-driven supply chain, and a holistic global expansion strategy, as well as the best-in-class consumer insights capability. Underlying all these initiatives, are the strengthening of our team and the right-sizing of our cost structure. When it comes to our costs, we just have to become more competitive. The work we are undertaking is the work we need to do to build the company back to high performance and position ourselves to lead in an increasingly disruptive environment. It's complex work that will take time. We will show you the pacing through the plan we will present in late spring and we'd show progress every year. I know how critical it is to build and maintain the trust of our shareholders. This will require clear and consistent performance and communication going forward. I am committed to both. We are going to be laser-focused on transitioning our business back to excellence. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Chris. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Revenues in the third quarter were down 1% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis, below our guidance of 0% to 2% reported growth. Despite the sales shortfall, we were able to generate operating margin above our guidance range due to both better expense management and a solid gross profit rate. The sales shortfall in the quarter was driven by our North America business due to the above average temperatures that persisted for most of the fall and holiday selling period, a significant drop in foreign tourist traffic, challenges in the Lauren brand, and general macroeconomic weakness. Our performance in international markets was much better as revenue grew 6% in constant currency outside of North America. Let me provide you with more color on our performance by key geographies. Starting with Europe, our revenue grew 8% in the third quarter in constant currency. Wholesale demand was particularly strong with robust sell-throughs that drove strong reorders. By region, northern and central Europe performed the best. In Asia, third quarter revenue was up 3% in constant currency. While this growth rate is below the high single-digit growth rate we posted in the first half of the year, it was within our expectations. We reduced markdowns and the length of the sale period in Japan and Korea, our two key markets within Asia. This pressured sales growth in the quarter, however drove gross margin improvement and gross profit growth. We believe these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand in this region. Looking at performance by country, Hong Kong and Macau continued to underperform due to reduced tourist traffic, while Japan and Australia continued to outperform. As we spoke about previously, we implemented price increases in key international markets to help mitigate the negative margin impact from currency fluctuations. I want to provide some perspective on how that's gone. In Japan, Australia and Canada the pricing actions we have taken have been well received by the customer and we have continued to gain market share in these markets. In Europe, we raised prices for the cruise and spring 2016 seasons. Early indications based on sell-in are encouraging, but it is too soon to have a definitive read on the consumer response. Moving on to the Americas, net revenue was down 4% in constant currency below our expectations. While we anticipated a challenging holiday season given the slow start to fall, it was even more difficult than we expected. The silver lining is that comps were positive in store locations where domestic customers represent more of the traffic similar to last quarter. As a result, we are optimistic that comps can show improvement as we begin to lap the foreign tourist traffic issues this coming summer. The sales challenges we faced in the third quarter are reflected in our operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as we are proactively clearing end of season inventories. We will carefully manage expenses to mitigate as much of the negative impact from these actions as possible. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a review of additional financial results and balance sheet dynamics. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Gross profit margin in the third quarter was 56.8% excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 20 basis points lower than the prior-year period primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency affects. On a constant-currency basis, gross margin was up 30 basis points compared to the prior-year period due to benefits from the initial phases of SKU and style rationalization, product cost negotiations, and favorable mix shifts. Operating margin in the third quarter was 13.7% excluding restructuring and other charges, 180 basis points below the prior-year period. This is better than the November outlook we provided of a 200 basis point to 250 basis point decline and was due to better expense management. The lower operating margin year-over-year was primarily attributable to negative foreign currency affects, fixed expense deleverage and incremental investments in infrastructure. Net income for the third quarter was $193 million or $2.27 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other charges. This compared to reported net income of $215 million or $2.41 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. On a reported basis, net income was $131 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 25% in the third quarter excluding restructuring and other charges and was 28% on a reported basis. This was lower than our guidance of 31% due primarily to discrete items recorded in the quarter and the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior-year period. Moving to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter up 5% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support sales growth for existing operations, new businesses, and new store openings. At the end of the third quarter, we had 31 more directly-operated stores and 85 additional concessions compared to the prior-year period which is contributing to the growth. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $611 million in total debt. The company repurchased 803,000 shares of its common stock during the third quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought year-to-date repurchases to $380 million. With that, I'll turn the call back to Chris, who'll provide guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and some initial thoughts on fiscal 2017. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Thanks, Bob. For the fourth quarter we are taking proactive action to clear end of season inventories for fall and holiday in the U.S. so that we start the spring selling season in a strong position. As a result, we expect reported revenues to be flat to down 2% on a reported basis, due to continued pressure from lower foreign tourist traffic, as well as higher allowances in the U.S. wholesale channel to move excess inventory. The fourth quarter includes the 53rd week which we estimate will contribute approximately $65 million in revenue. We estimate the negative currency impact on sales growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately 150 basis points based on current exchange rates. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 400 basis points to 450 basis points below the prior-year period due to the proactive action we are taking on inventory in addition to infrastructure investments and negative foreign exchange impacts. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 32%. For the full year, fiscal 2016 period, revenues are expected to decline approximately 3% on a reported basis with 400 basis points of negative impact from currency. This compares to our prior outlook of flat revenues on a reported basis and 400 basis points of foreign exchange impact. The full year fiscal 2016 operating margin is now estimated to be 290 basis points to 320 basis points below the prior-year's level which compares to our previous expectation of 180 basis point to 230 basis point decline. This guidance excludes restructuring and other charges that are primarily related to restructuring activities associated with our global brand reorganization and a pending customs audit. We expect these restructuring charges to approximate $120 million to $150 million for fiscal 2016 excluding $34 million for pending customs audit. We recognized $42 million of this charge in the third quarter and $113 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. We remain on track to deliver the $110 million of annual expense savings associated with our global brand restructuring effort. We will get a partial benefit this year and the entirety of the benefit in fiscal 2017. Our fiscal 2016 tax rate is expected to be 28%. We continue to plan $400 million to $500 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to support our global direct-to-consumer and infrastructure investments. Now let me provide some initial thoughts on how we're thinking about fiscal 2017. We recently started the planning process for fiscal 2017, which as Stefan said, will include a deep dive into all aspects of the business. The plan will include the following key elements; first, we plan to right-size and increase the quality of our distribution; second, we plan to intentionally reduce the depth of the inventory buy to decrease discount rates and promotional selling levels; and third, we plan to take significant action to improve the company's cost structure. While we are still working through the details, at this point, we expect fiscal 2017 total revenues to be down versus fiscal 2016, and operating margin to be up versus fiscal 2016 excluding restructuring and other charges. The operating margin improvement will be despite an approximate $90 million negative operating income impact from foreign currency in fiscal 2017. We look forward to sharing more details on our outlook in late spring. With that, let me turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Chris. In closing, let me reiterate, within the company we see the current performance of the business as very disappointing and we have full focus across the whole organization to drive the business back to higher performance. The challenges we are facing did not materialize overnight. They developed over years and our solutions will take time as well. I want to be very clear. The growth journey we set out on is not to drive results next quarter, but rather position Ralph Lauren for success and relevance over the next decade and beyond. We have an opportunity to do something that will build Ralph Lauren stronger than ever before. In a world where the customer is in charge, we will build everything we do around our customer's dream of a life well-lived. We will give them access to authentic-style, quality and specialness in all aspects of their life, and we will do this in a way that we build on what made us great and we evolve it in new and innovative ways. I look forward to providing more specifics when we share our detailed growth plan in late spring. One thing is clear; I never had a stronger vision to build on. The combined strength of the brand of Ralph, one of the most iconic designers in the world, our talented team, and my experience of driving high performance in this industry, makes me very excited for the future ahead. With the full support of Ralph, our Board of Directors, we will move forward to create significant shareholder value. And with that, I would like to open up the call for your questions. Thank you. Operator : The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning. Stefan, I'd like to ask you, obviously you've (23:49) got a lot of different things on your plate, but if I could get some of your initial thoughts potentially on the complexity of the brands and is there a need to simplify the brands, not just from a management perspective internally, but also maybe it's confusing to the consumer side as well. And then also, do you think there is a need to right-size any of the lower-end businesses like the outlet and off price? Thank you. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Omar. Yes, you're right. There is \u2013 we are in the middle of assessment, so I can give you some early reads, which is we need to focus. I'm a big believer in my leadership approach overall to focus, and that includes our brands. So in the plan that we will come back with in late spring, I will be very detailed in terms of how I look at being focused given the multiple brands we have. What excites me though is that the more I learn about the brand, the more I realize the strength of the brand. So focusing on where we will win when it comes to the brands will be essential, and I'll come back and give you more details. When it comes to the quality of our distribution, that's also something that we are looking through in detail and as I shared in my initial remarks, we will build Ralph Lauren into stronger position it's ever had. That's a long-term job. I'll be able to give you more details in May, but we are looking through every single channel and I'm going to make sure that the plan that we move forward with enables us to drive brand strength and drive profitable sales growth at the same time. Operator : Thank you. The next question... Evren Kopelman - Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS Investment Research. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : (25:57 \u2013 26:06) for next year that's going to be fairly hard for us to pencil out with some \u2013 any kind of clarity in our models. Just maybe directionally how you're thinking about \u2013 I know, it's early, but directionally how you're thinking about magnitude, particularly on the revenue line. Just to help us with our longer range thinking. And then if we could just go back to try and connect some of the comments you made today to some of the investment buckets that we're used to hearing about from you over the last few years and maybe how much leverage we can think about for fiscal 2017 in terms of the buckets you've given, one the retail strategy, two the SAP and e-commerce, and then three the cost restructuring, Chris, it sounded like from your deep-dive comments that there could be something you guys are looking at that's incremental to the original plan that's led to about $110 million in cost savings. Thanks. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah. Thanks, Michael. I think the answer to that is, what Stefan started with, which is we're in an assessment phase on all aspects of the business, and we're working through to create a strategic and financial plan that can drive shareholder value, can drive profitable sales growth and can strengthen the brand over the midterm. We plan to share that plan in more detail in late spring, and so we're not yet at the point where we're ready to quantify the elements of the guidance for fiscal 2017 beyond what we shared in the script this morning. What I can say on the buckets is that, particularly we shared I think, on the call, the FX impact that we expect next year. We remain on track on the infrastructure on both SAP and e-commerce to complete the SAP European implementation next year, as well as the e-commerce re-platforming next year. And we remain on track, as I mentioned, to deliver the $110 million of cost savings from the initial global brand restructure, but we are in the assessment phase and we'll share more details in late spring. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. So, I guess, if we kind of piece this together and think about multi-year constant currency revenues, beyond the impact of FX today, what's \u2013 I guess, what's the best way to think about wholesale and retail constraints today both here and also abroad versus, Stefan potentially maybe the opportunity you see for a return to growth? Kind of, some of the things that may be impacting you next year versus some of the opportunities that you see; and with that, if you kind of broke down into the product, Polo versus Lauren, just kind of from a pricing perspective, do you think that you're appropriately set or do you think that there is changes that need to be made to the core infrastructure of the price that's going out the door to the customer today? Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Thank you, Matt. So starting with the pricing. It's going to be an important part and it is an important part of our assessment to look through our whole offering to our customers. So given the recent very disappointing performance, we are asking and I'm driving that \u2013 we are asking the tough questions in every single area of the business. Because what I am determined to do with the team and with the support of Ralph is to match the business performance with the strength of the brand. So when I look at the brand, it's one of the strongest in the industry. And when I looked at our performance over the last couple of years, including the recent quarters, it's very disappointing. So I see significant untapped value in both the idea behind the brand and as well as how we drive the business. And therefore, in the way I outlined the way we approach, building the growth plan for the future, there will be a customer facing component which is about evolving the brand, evolving our product, marketing, shopping experience, and then radically improve some of our business engines. And I believe that driving brand strength for the future and driving consistent profitable sales growth, and in turn giving high shareholder return is to strengthen both those components, both the customer-facing part and the underlying engines and have them play together. That's also what I have experience of doing from my two previous brands. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Ms. Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My question is just with regards to the brand. Stefan you said you have done a lot of work on assessing the brand and just in some of the questions you've just answered, you again attested to the strength of the brand. Could you let us know a little bit more detail about maybe what some of the strengths are? What is so appealing about the brand to the consumer and what can you leverage over time? Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Kate. So when it comes to the brand, what excites me is that Ralph's original idea behind the brand when he created it, it was much bigger than apparel, and it was much bigger than product. So it was about inviting the customers into an aspirational life, their aspirational life. And being very consistent and offering authentic style, high-quality, and deliver specialness in the experience. And if you look at the disruptive market today, I believe that that's exactly what you need to do to win. You need to be special. You need to deliver a value that goes beyond apparel, and if you look at the customer, it's \u2013 the customer is now in charge. And the customer is living a busy life. And what excites me about the original brand vision and building that out and why I see so much potential in it, is that we should deliver style to the customer. And we can do that and we are known to do that and why we are so loved is because we have been so consistent in delivering authentic style, quality and specialness. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: The brand has a number of different avenues of distribution, wholesale, off-price, full-price retail, outlet. Can you just talk a little bit about what area do you view as quality and what function each of those avenues of distribution serves? And then just a quick follow-up for Chris. I'm curious what gives you visibility to margin improvement year-over-year in light of the potential deleverage on the sales shortfall and some of the other puts and takes that you talked about. Thanks. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks. Let me start. It's Stefan. Quality of distribution for me is any channel that gives us an ability to strengthen our brand and drive profitable sales growth at the same time. So we'll come back in late spring and give you more details on how we see our portfolio of distribution going forward. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : And relative to the operating margin visibility for fiscal 2017, I think the thing that gives us visibility into that from the initial planning phase is a number of factors, including the full-year impact of the cost savings that we've generated from the global brand restructuring. The full-year impact of the pricing that we've taken in devaluation markets that should kick in next year. Cost savings that we're going after through the SKU and style rationalization, and the work that we're beginning on right-sizing the company's cost structure for next year as part of the planning process, which we'll share more detail on in late spring when we come back with the plan. And I think all of those things taken in aggregate, we have visibility to suggest that that is going to result in operating margin being up versus the drag of foreign exchange that we have for next year and fixed expense deleverage. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Patel with Stephens, Inc. Rick Patel - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you, and good morning. So, Stefan, we'd like to hear your thoughts on the product and concept pipeline? Over the past several quarters we've heard the company introducing woman's Polo, Polo retail, they reintroduced Polo Sport. As we think about the median term, should we expect the primary drivers of organic growth to be the ramp up of these newly-introduced areas? Or are there new sub-brands and concepts that we may be hearing about in the future as you do your assessment of all the brands? Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Rick. Well, I come back to that, it's a part of the assessments. I will give you detailed outline of how I think about these questions in May. But just initial thoughts is that my experience of driving high performance in this industry is very much connected to finding a systemic repeatable way of creating a stronger and stronger assortment, and it's still early days but I see big untapped value potential there. When it comes to evolving assortment in terms of the balance of the assortment, and in terms of sports and catering to the customer's different needs, I'm coming back to why I believe in the brand. I believe that we should give our customer access to a life in style better than anyone else and that means mirroring what their need is and how they build up their wardrobe. And we can do that more authentic with higher quality and with more specialness than anybody else. And we can also and we should think in new ways and innovative ways of how we can utilize the disruptive world we are in to actually deliver that specialness to the customer in a way that excites and delights them, but also that makes it convenient for them. And I'll come back in late spring with more details. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, good morning. So I just had two quick questions. Number one, just to follow-up on the prior one. Could you talk a little about your early reads on that you've seen so far on the Polo Sport business and the inclusion there in Dick's and some other wholesale partners, and then also maybe a little bit about Europe, you gave some commentary on your own business by geography, but could you maybe talk about whether you saw any incremental weakness due to the terrorist attack in Paris or if you feel any kind of shift in cadence among local consumers just broadly there relative to maybe the back half of \u2013 or earlier in 2015? Thanks. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Yeah, let me start with Europe and then I'll turn to Stefan for Polo. In Europe, we delivered constant currency growth in the third quarter of 8%. So, it was a pretty strong performance from a revenue standpoint. We were disrupted from the terrorist attack in Paris. We actually had a number of our stores shut down both in France and the UK for a few days and we saw the shopping pull back. But it returned relatively quickly after that and so that's how we were able to deliver a relatively strong result of the 8% constant currency top line growth despite that short-term disruption. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Yes, and when it comes to the Polo Sport question, I tie it to getting closer to our customers. Given that we are about style and we are going to be the customer's preferred supplier for aspirational style to their wardrobe, it's about getting as close as we can to them. That's why as one of the underlying business engine that we're going to develop is a consumer insights capability that gives us the possibility to reflect if it's \u2013 if the customer builds their wardrobe on more of an at leisure and sport component, our offerings should reflect that. And it also makes me think about how Ralph has been 10 years, 15 years ahead on many macro trends because we were one of the first in the industry several years back in thinking about sport, and what we have to do now is we have to get close to the customer and we have to evolve our offering so we reflect how they want to build their wardrobe. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital. Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gross margin was up 30 basis points on a constant FX basis compared to 90 basis points last quarter. Was the difference due to lower benefits from sourcing, SKU rationalization, and product mix, or were there additional factors we should consider? How should we think about that for the fourth quarter? And then lastly, last February it was noted that your hedges for inventory purchases is six months to nine months out with 70% exposure rate. Has that \u2013 have those factors changed over the last year as we think about FY 2017? Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so let me address those. So, the gross margin performance in the third quarter was impacted largely by the U.S. market versus the second quarter because in the U.S. market we saw a difficult, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, fall holiday selling period. In our fourth quarter guidance is reflected on the gross margin rate, a plan to increase markdown monies and allowances to clear excess fall and holiday inventory so that we start the spring selling season strong. I would say that's really the driver in the gross margin trend in Q3 and Q4. With regard to FX and hedging, our hedging policy has not changed; it's consistent. And so we expect at current exchange rates to have a very small to nominal impact on translation next year in fiscal 2017, but we will have a transactional impact, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. The combination of those two we expect to impact the results by about $90 million negatively as the favorable hedges \u2013 we lap the favorable hedge benefit this year going into next year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen & Company. John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Stefan, you talked a lot about disruption; you used the word several times. Can you help us understand what you see as the most disruptive factor to the apparel category in general right now? Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Good morning, John. Yes. When it comes to the disruption, I'm a firm believer that we're just seeing the beginning. So I believe that the biggest disruption is that the customer is now in charge. So the customer has better visibility and better choices than ever before. So any company that's in the business of providing generic products or don't have any real value add beyond the lower and lower price or who, more importantly, is not close enough to the customer will be in trouble. So that's why we are building on the strength that's made us great, and we are adding an even closer focus to what's going on in the market and what's going on with the customer. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Just a follow-up question on some of the channels you're reevaluating. The department store channel obviously has been very, very important in the U.S. for the development of the brand, and it's evolved over the years. Certainly the shops are very brand enhancing, but obviously there's been a lot of promotional activity, a lot of focus on key items; selling at a discount. Is that an example of one of the channels you're taking a closer look at to perhaps shorten lead times and improve the quality of sales? And can you still maintain the same kind of space in those department stores if you end up shipping less into that channel? Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Thank you, David. So when it comes to department stores, they have been very important \u2013 you're right \u2013 to what has made us great from a business performance historically. And they will continue to be important to us. And yes, we are focusing in the plan we're building and coming back with the details in late spring, we are focusing on some of the underlying business engines that I see yes, it's early days, but I already see based on my experience that we have a lot of value unlock to do. So one is how we systematically and repeatable build \u2013 how we in a systematic and repeatable way build assortment stronger and stronger. There is also a supply chain and inventory management component, which is to become much better at balancing supply and demand. And there is also an expansion strategy, which is to say how do we grow with quality in all the different channels we have because I believe in that department stores, direct to consumer are going to play together, and offline and online are going to play together. And what I've \u2013 again, coming back to my own experience, well, I have experience of this to drive a highly profitable global growth strategy. And I believe we have opportunities in being \u2013 taking a holistic expansion approach to our brand and our business, and by doing that unlock even more brand strength and unlock even more value in terms of driving profitable sales growth. Christopher H. Peterson - President- Global Brands : Okay. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And as always, we will be available for follow-up questions after the call. Stefan Larsson - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 conference call. With me today are Stefan Larsson, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Madore, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may include our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. And now, I will turn the call over to Stefan. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying we are making progress in setting and beginning to execute our strategy to return Ralph Lauren Corporation to profitable growth. In doing that, we will balance driving near-term performance with our long-term vision. I look forward to doing a deep dive on our plan and providing a Q1 and fiscal 2017 outlook, as well as discussing how our plan will translate into long-term financial performance at our Investor Day on June 7. When we last spoke, I shared with you how I spent my first three months in the role; my initial observations and a rough outline of my approach to building the growth plan for this great company. Today, I will provide an overview of our main priorities and recent performance before turning the call over to Bob to discuss the Q4 and fiscal year financial results in more detail. In recent months, while I've been working hard to drive the business here and now, I've also worked closely with our teams to complete the comprehensive review of the business and develop the strategic plan. Through that work, we have gained a very clear understanding of the underlying drivers of the current performance and we now have a detailed view of what's driving the downward trend. In short, we have not focused enough on nor evolved enough the core of what made us great in product, marketing and the shopping experience. In addition, our underlying business engines are not running at full speed. We also have an inefficient cost structure and an organization that's not nimble enough in the marketplace. What made us great was a crystal clear focus on owning classic iconic style and putting an effortless twist to it to make it current and desirable. We will become more true to our core focused assortment on creating the best iconic style in the market and evolve the way we twist it so it becomes more desirable for today. Iconic style made current has never been more relevant. While staying true to our DNA, we will also evolve our marketing and the shopping experience to better reflect the aspirational life and style people dream of today. We have many unique strengths to build on. These include our brand strength, being the original for aspirational authentic American and iconic style, a very strong share position, a talented team and a solid infrastructure. In our diagnosis of the business, I've been deeply embedded with our global teams who create the customer offering. These are the teams that create our products, marketing and shopping experience, as well as run the inventory management, sourcing and supply chain, the core value-creating drivers in our business. They must provide our regions and channels with a consumer offering we need to win versus our best competitors. I've done this deep dive to understand how we create our offering and what drives the underperformance of today. What I've learned is encouraging because we now know what we need to do differently, and we have a clear line of sight to improving the way we connect with consumers and operate the business. For most of my 18-year career in this industry, I've led teams through the process of turning creative energy and talent into high-performance businesses. I know the value driving components of the creative processes from my time with H&M and then in turning around Old Navy. I'm excited to see so much untapped potential at Ralph Lauren and we will leverage our brand vision into a much stronger consumer offering. This offering will be built by evolving our brand voice, our products, our marketing and our shopping experience, in parallel with developing stronger underlying business engines, rightsizing our cost structure and strengthening our leadership team. Getting these elements right will help us connect more with our existing consumers, expand our reach to new consumers and return the business to strong growth over time. An important part of getting back to high-performance is strengthening our leadership team on both the design and operation side of the business. I'm pleased with how we're starting to come together here. We're recruiting new talent and challenging our top performers with expanded roles. A few examples are Valerie Hermann, Fredrik Hjalmers and Holiday Alagos (06:18). Valerie has been with Ralph Lauren for little over two years and has started to build a foundation that will strengthen our luxury business. She has decades of experience in luxury, including CEO of Yves Saint Laurent and Head of Women's Ready to Wear for Dior. She has built a track record of strengthening brands and driving high performance in luxury. She has unique experience in working to commercialize design and drive profitable growth. We have therefore recently expanded Valerie's role as brand president to now also include Lauren, Polo Women's, Chaps and Denim & Supply. Fredrik Hjalmers joined us in April in the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Global Expansion and Business Development. He has seven years of experience leading high performance global expansion to new markets within the H&M Group. Fredrik will be responsible for globally leading the work to create and execute the strongest possible multi-brand and multichannel distribution and expansion strategy for the company, which is one of the core components in our growth plan. Holiday Alagos (07:33) is joining our team in June as Head of Global Sourcing. She has 18 years of experience driving high performance within production and sourcing for H&M and her track record is stellar. Holiday (07:46) has been a key driver for H&M's ability to make sourcing a competitive advantage and she created a tremendous amount of value for them. We're looking forward to Holiday (07:33) coming on board as we develop the best-in-class sourcing strategy. We will continue to strengthen our team in the months and years ahead and I'm happy to say that our teams are aligned and excited about where we're going and how we are going to get there. We will move this company into the future in a way that excites our consumers, beats our competitors and drives value for the company and shareholders. One way Ralph made this company great was by being an entrepreneur and that's what we're going back to. We're going to move fast to begin executing our growth strategy, continuously learn and improve, get closer to the consumer and get back to high performance. Now let me turn to a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. As you saw in the press release, net revenues were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. The key driver for the top line performance in the fourth quarter was as expected pressure in North America which was offset by growth in international markets. Following a challenging fall and holiday seasons, we were focused on clearing end of season's inventories across our channels of distribution in the U.S. I've been focusing much of my time on our U.S. business. I've been working closely with our key customers in the market. As we look to fiscal 2017, we are planning our inventory and receipts very carefully in the U.S. for both the wholesale and retail channels. Our strategic plan will address the issues in our core U.S. market. Moving on to our profitability, Q4 gross margin was pressured by the inventory clearance activity in the U.S. and continued foreign currency impact. Our operating margin was down significantly, but better than our guidance, driven by strong expense management. While I'm feeling relatively good about how we managed expenses, I want to make it clear that I see this kind of operating income decline as unacceptable. We have significant opportunity to further reduce costs and reinvest some of those savings in engines that will drive brand strength and profitable sales growth. Before I turn it over to Bob for the details of our financial performance in the quarter and fiscal 2016, I want to reiterate that we are looking forward to sharing our strategic growth plan in detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter net revenues were flat with the prior-year period on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis to $1.9 billion. This is in line with the guidance we provided in February of a flat to 2% decline on a reported basis. The negative FX impact to revenue growth was approximately 110 basis points, slightly better than our expectation of 150 basis points of negative impact as foreign currencies moved favorably during the quarter. The company's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 included a 53rd week that contributed approximately $70 million in sales and was primarily generated within the retail segment. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, net revenues grew 1% in constant currency and declined 3% on a reported basis to $7.4 billion. Gross profit margin was 54.4% in the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges. This was 90 basis points below the prior-year period, reflecting proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end of season inventories related to the fall season in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, gross margin declined 70 basis points to 56.8%, excluding restructuring charges, due to negative foreign currency impacts which was partially offset by a favorable sales mix shift to the retail segment. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 370 basis points below the prior year due to gross margin pressure, unfavorable foreign currency effects and incremental investments in infrastructure and marketing. However, operating margin was better than the outlook we provided in February of a 400-basis point to 450-basis point decline. This was due to disciplined expense management throughout the organization. For the full year fiscal 2016 period, operating margin declined 290 basis points to 10.7%, excluding restructuring and other charges, due to gross margin pressure, fixed expense deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency effects, and incremental investments in infrastructure and new stores. Net income for the fourth quarter was $74 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. On a reported basis, net income in the fourth quarter was $41 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. For the full year period, net income was $546 million, or $6.36 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other charges. The effective tax rate of 34% in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis was higher than the guidance of 32% due to one-time discrete items and compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the prior-year period. Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues decreased 5% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and 6% on a reported basis to $942 million. This was primarily due to a decline in North America, as business trends remain challenging. We are refining our product assortments and deliveries for fiscal 2017 to improve trends in this channel in what is a very challenging environment. Wholesale operating margin in the fourth quarter was 27.2%, excluding restructuring and other charges. This was 350 basis points below the prior-year period due to proactive measures taken in the U.S. to clear end of season inventories related to the fall season and negative foreign currency effects. Retail segment sales rose 7% in constant currency and 6% on a reported basis to $889 million. Growth was driven by the benefit of a 53rd week of sales, new store expansion, and e-commerce growth. On a 13-week to 13-week basis, consolidated comparable store sales decreased 5% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the fourth quarter. Brick-and-mortar traffic trends remained negative in the U.S. Sales to foreign tourists were down approximately 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year. E-commerce revenue was up mid-single digits on a global basis in the fourth quarter supported by the 53rd week, while comps were up slightly on a 13-week to 13-week basis. We continue to expect to move to our new e-commerce platform later this fiscal year. The new platform will not only improve the functionality of our site, but will allow us to improve how we engage with our customers digitally and across our retail channels. We believe this will dramatically improve the customers' experience on mobile devices. We look forward to delivering a best-in-class site experience. At year-end, we had 493 directly operated standalone stores and 583 concessions globally. That represents an increase of 27 net new directly operated stores and 47 concession shops when compared to the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 93 Ralph Lauren stores and 42 dedicated shops as well as 58 Club Monaco stores and 75 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of fiscal 2016. Retail operating margin in the fourth quarter excluding restructuring and other charges was 2.4% which was 100 basis points below the prior-year period, reflecting proactive measures taken to clear end of season inventories in the U.S. in addition to negative foreign currency effects. Licensing revenues increased 8% and operating income was up 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher royalties from increased sales of Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lauren products worldwide. Now let me provide some color on performance by geography in the quarter. In the Americas, net revenue declined 1% in constant currency driven by pressure in our North America business that we spoke about previously. Same-store sales were down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. In Europe, net revenues were up 4% in constant currency. We continued to experience strong sell-through rates at our retail partners across most of our brands and same-store sales were positive in our own retail stores. In Asia, net revenue growth of 3% in constant currency was muted by a decline in same-store sales, which was negatively impacted by our strategy to reduce markdowns in Japan and Korea, our two key markets in Asia. We experienced gross margin improvement and our average unit retails were up strong double digits in Japan and Korea and our markdown rates were down significantly. We believe that these actions will continue to help us elevate the brand and drive profitable sales growth in this region. Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the global brand management initiative. The total restructuring charge for fiscal 2016 was $142 million. In addition, we incurred another $22 million of impairment related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure. We now expect to deliver approximately $125 million of annual cost savings from the fiscal 2016 Global Reorganization Plan, $15 million higher than the $110 million that we communicated previously. This is driven by additional restructuring activities we identified and executed late in the fiscal year. We had a part year benefit in fiscal 2016 from our restructuring activities and will have a full year benefit in fiscal 2017. Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory was $1.1 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up 8% year-over-year. This growth reflects investments to support new stores and concession shops and a change in the timing of receipt plans. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 27 more directly operated stores and 47 more concession shops than a year ago, which is contributing to the growth. Moving to capital expenditures, we spent $418 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $391 million in fiscal 2015 mostly to support new retail stores, concession shops and infrastructure projects. The company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at a cost of $100 million. This brought our total buyback activity to 4.2 million shares for a total cost of $480 million for the full year. In addition, we returned $170 million to shareholders via dividend payments. Yesterday, the company's board of directors authorized an additional $200 million stock repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $100 million available at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as part of a previously authorized stock repurchase program, bringing the company's total current authorization to $300 million. We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $713 million of total debt. Looking out to fiscal 2017, as Stefan mentioned, we plan to provide financial guidance at our Investors Day on June 7 for the new fiscal year as well as the first quarter of fiscal 2017. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Operator : The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Thanks for all the updates and information. Stefan, I know you probably don't want to steal your own thunder for the investor meeting next month, but I'd love to hear if you have any updated thoughts and views as you've had another 90 days to be immersed in the business regarding the complexity of the business structure and the brand structure across channels, price points, sub-brands, categories, globally. It's obviously a very unique aspect of the company, and I'm just wondering how you're thinking about it and what you've learned on that front. And does this excess complexity internally and externally the consumer, is it something that you can address over time or does it need to be addressed? Thanks. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Omar. Yes, you've covered basically the agenda for the Investor Day. So I'm sorry to disappoint you to refer the detailed answer to your question will have to wait until the Investor Day on June 7. What I can say is that we have made progress in assessing and knowing exactly where we stand as a business and we feel really confident in that we have the strategy to build the company back to a high performance. And part of that will be simplicity because simplicity and focus is, as I shared last quarterly call, something that I believe in and I also believe in building on the core of what's made us great and that's what the strategy is going to be built on. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask, Stefan, you talked a little bit about the focus on the product, iconic styles with an updated twist. As you think about the company's lead times and the work that you've already done, when should we think about the timing for new product to hit? And then separately, if you guys could just give an update on how effective the price increases you took overseas were? I know we heard that in Japan and I think Australia that consumers accepted it and it worked, but we were still waiting to hear on Europe for the early part of this year. Thanks. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Hey. Thanks, Lindsay. I'll go first. It's Stefan. Yes, so the work to evolve the products will be tightly connected with the work of strengthening our underlying business engine; one being the supply chain. So your question is very relevant. We will address it in detail on June 7, but we have a clear path to how we're going to evolve the product and how we're going to connect that with improvement in supply chain. And I can give high-level thoughts on supply chain, which is that I see big opportunities to start there and in two areas, both inventory management part and the lead time part. So in essence, I see opportunities to sell more with less inventory and I also see an opportunity to drastically increase our speed and our flexibility. So that will help us when we evolve the consumer-facing offering. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Lindsay, it's Bob, and I'll take the question around the price increases. We're very pleased with the price increases that we've taken in the major markets where we experienced FX headwinds, mainly Japan, Australia, Canada and Europe. And as an example of that, for instance, our European business revenues grew mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, and we plan to maintain the price increases that we've implemented across all those countries. As another example of the acceptance by the consumer, within our Asian business we've seen a significant improvement in our quality of sale metrics. Our gross profit percentage has increased, our average unit retails have gone up, we've seen an improvement in our comp gross margin dollar, so overall, as I said, we're very pleased and we're going to maintain those increases going forward. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS Investment Research. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks a lot. Congrats on a nice quarter, guys. No doubt it's tough out there. So one question and a follow up, I guess. It sounds like we're going to get a lot of detail in June and the look ahead of the plan, but if we could just reference to your prior comment, the revenues will be negative next year as you rebase but that operating margins could still be up. I know we talked about this during the quarter, but the math on that reality seems pretty hard to envision and the market is deteriorating as we've seen earnings reports here this week. Are those guideposts still on the table? And if so, Stefan, now that you've had a look under the hood for a while, where do you see the most opportunity to manage costs to get to that reality? Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Michael, I'll take that one actually. I think that general guidance still holds, and I apologize for this, but we'll be able to give much more specific guidance at our Investor Day on June 7. We think it's really important to provide a complete view of our strategic plan and the financial targets that are tied to the plan together. So I'm going to have to ask you to be patient and wait until June 7 Investor Day. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes, just to complement on what Bob just said, when it comes to rightsizing the cost structure, it's something that we have spent a lot of time on over the last few months and we see big opportunities there. So we're looking at every component of the cost structure. We'd go through it and share with you on the Investor Day. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And I'll add one other thing, too. Just as a reminder, and we mentioned it in our opening remarks that we did take restructuring actions within fiscal 2016, and as we've noted, that's going to drive approximately $125 million of savings. That $125 million savings number is in excess of the previously communicated $110 million, really because towards the end of the fourth quarter we did take additional restructuring actions and activities that drove the increased savings number. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan Chase. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. So on the distribution front, Stefan, how do you view your wholesale positioning and off-price exposure out of the quarter? Who do you see as your primary competition today? And then as it relates to e-commerce, what's the best way to think about Amazon as a potential channel of distribution? Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Good question. So when it comes to the U.S. market where it's clear that we have been under the most pressure, my focus is to get back to high performance in the U.S. wholesale channel. So that's to start with. It's our main focus, working very closely with our big customers and feel confident that we have a plan to get back to strength. In parallel with that, we are expanding our direct-to-consumer channels, and out of those channels, the e-commerce is by far the most important to get back to strength and high performance. And overall when it comes to the channels in the U.S., we are working to make sure that we secure the high-quality distribution, right balance in the distribution between the different channels, and we'll come back and give you more details in June. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think you had highlighted that in the calendar year fourth quarter that you had made changes to retail, which I think is part of that $125 million in savings where you closed some doors. But then I think you also re-bannered some of the retail doors as well. Can you update us on how those changes have impacted the retail base and how you think about that going forward? Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, hi, Kate. It's Bob. I'll take that question. So for the fiscal year, we actually closed approximately 43 stores. Part of that was incorporated within the restructuring charge activities and some of it was just natural lease expirations and stores that just didn't fit our strategic portfolio or plan. From a rebalancing perspective, our RLS or Ralph Lauren portfolio between full-price stores and Polo stores, we had identified roughly 40% of the fleet that was essentially positioned more towards Polo. We started to undertake conversion of some of those stores to standalone Polo stores versus a hybrid of Ralph Lauren and Polo, and that'll be done over a period of time. These aren't going to incorporate major remodel activities. These are signage changes, an element of minor remodel activity, et cetera, and we've probably touched about 15% of that portfolio thus far with the remainder to be done over the next year, 18 months. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna. Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you for taking my question. I guess, Stefan, for you, just when you think about the major U.S. accounts, the wholesale accounts, and all the work you've been having conversations with them of late, when you sit down and have a conversation with them, what do they say about the brand opportunity to grow or return to growth beyond 2017, assuming that you've already sort of enlightened them or shared some of the strategic opportunities and brand positioning as we move forward? Just sort of what are they telling you that Ralph needs to do or needs to be? Maybe that would be helpful. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes. So thanks, Chris. Good question. So when I sit down and spend time with our wholesale partners, they start with how much they respect the Ralph Lauren brand and how important that brand is to them and their consumers. So that's where we start, and then given the nature of how I lead, I ask a lot of questions of how we can build on that strength and how we can evolve our offering and how we can make sure that we start to drive high performance again, which we have done for many, many years. And they are very confident in evolving our products, evolving our marketing, evolving our shopping experience and combining that, when I share how we are planning to high level strengthen our underlying business engines, they get really excited and they want to be a part of that journey. And I see them as an intricate part in evolving the business engines, and I'm excited to do this journey together with them. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Just a follow up on the U.S. wholesale business. I'm just curious, when you look at and you've talked about needing more innovation in the product, but when you look at the positioning of the brand from an initial price point perspective and you look at how sort of key item intensive the business has become and reliant on some of those key selling period promotions to drive key items, how do you see that evolving from a price point perspective and sort of key item versus fashion perspective going forward? Thanks. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, David. So when it comes to pricing, I believe that we're in a world where the consumer decides today. So charging (32:58) a premium pricing comes back to having the best products, and that's what our strategy is focused on, to go back to the core of who we are and where we come from and evolve that and make it current for today and have better authentic style, better quality and be more relevant, and that connects to the pricing. And when it comes to the actual product strategy, I look forward to sharing that more in detail when we see each other in June. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital. Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Valerie Hermann's appointment to President of the Luxury Collection. Last May, you announced six group global brand groups. Are these six groups still in place? And if so, now that these groups anniversary full year, can you parse out how big they are in terms of revenues? Can you rank them in order of performance? And then any color around which division you're most excited about would be great. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Laurent. So starting with the brand groups and the global brand teams so I spent many, many hours over the last three months together with the global brand teams and they are more important than ever before because the teams there they create global consumer offering. They create the design of the products, and do the overall inventory management and the planning and connects to the supply chain team. So they drive the core value creating engine. And when it comes to Valerie's expanded role, I'm expanding her role because I want to leverage her experience of commercializing design and driving high performance out of creativity. So the brand teams are doing great. I look forward to again sharing the details in June and how the different brand teams relate to each other. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Kernan with Cowen & Co. John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Stefan, can you talk about how you're going to bring some of the best practices of the supply chain from H&M and Old Navy? Obviously the execution there was fantastic while you were there. And does it translate well to a wholesale dominated business? Can you take a lot of those best practices in terms of the speed of design and the speed in the supply chain and translate that into a wholesale business? Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes. John, again, sorry to disappoint you. The in-depth sharing of this we'll have to wait until June, but higher level I'm very excited when it comes to unlocking supply chain capabilities. And getting to know the business the way I've done over the last months and getting to know how our customers work, I see big opportunities in implementing a lot of the same best practice. And also excited by seeing that our wholesale partners are very excited and willing to dive into improving the supply chain together with us. John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC: Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rick Patel with Stephens, Inc. Rick Patel - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Stefan, before you got here, the company invested quite heavily in SAP and e-commerce and I know a lot of that is still going on today. As we sit here today, are you satisfied with the capabilities you have from a technology perspective? Or should we expect a step-up in terms of new investments that might be needed to get the company to where it needs to be? Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Rick, thanks for the question. Having had the chance to dive deeper into the company, I'm impressed by the capability when it comes to the infrastructure. So far it's the strongest I've seen so I feel from a business strategy and execution of the strategies we have set up, the capabilities are going to enable us to do that in a way that I haven't seen before in any of the companies I've been working out. So I'm excited that we have that foundation of infrastructure in place and that will just speed up our implementation of the strategy because the core elements of the strategy are not necessarily capital-intensive. It's about a methodology. It's about how we approach the business, how we evolve the consumer offering, how we get the business engines, the underlying engines to go, how we get the cost structure to be right sized and how we strengthen the leadership team continuously. So very pleased. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. We'll take one final question. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Good morning, everyone. As you think about the levers underneath the gross margin and especially if you're bringing in the new sourcing person, what are the opportunities in those gross margin levers underneath? And what do you see is the opportunity to increase speed to market with sourcing? Thank you. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: Hi, Dana and thanks for the question. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Lauren Corp.: A couple of thoughts on that high level and then again June 7 in detail, I'd love to share that with you, but high level, we see opportunities when it comes to evolving the strength of the products. One area is developing a systematic repeatable way of how we create assortment and we'll go through that in detail in June. But I see definitely value unlock there in terms of gross margin expansion. Also when it comes to the demand driven supply chain, so when it comes to being more balanced in making sure that the inventory we plan and buy, that that matches with the consumer demand. And then thirdly, I'm excited to bring Holiday (39:20) in with her sourcing expertise and her sourcing experience because I know firsthand that she brings best-in-class, best in industry sourcing capabilities and she will have to have a few months of learning the business and then she will start to unlock gross margin dollars there as well. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : And that was the final question. Raye (39:50) any closing? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now I will turn the call over to Stefan. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. We last spoke at our Investor Day in early June where we shared with you the details of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan is our multi-year plan to build on the unique brand strength we have, go back to the core of what made us iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable profitable growth. Today, I will share my key takeaways from the first quarter and then provide a brief update on what we have achieved and learned so far in starting to drive the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I will turn it over to Bob to review the company's quarterly financial performance in more detail. Beginning with the quarter, performance was mostly in line with our expectations with some minor puts and takes, as we would expect at this early stage of the execution of our Way Forward Plan. On the revenue side, the domestic business, as expected, continued to be challenged while the international business delivered a strong quarter, posting 10% revenue growth year-over-year. The main drivers to the decline in North America are what we shared in detail during the Investor Day. A combination of not having evolved our consumer offering enough in product, marketing, shopping experience, and having had an operating model that has generated too much excess inventory. Having these self-induced challenges are hurting us when we, like everyone else, are facing difficult retail traffic trends in a highly promotional environment. In our international markets, even though we have a much smaller presence there than in North America and we globally have much improvement work to do ahead of us, there were valuable learnings in the quarter that we will use in building back strength in our domestic business. Let me give you a few examples. In Asia, over the last six months, we have acted aggressively to drive quality of sales up. Our team there proactively closed 43 brand weakening locations, reduced the length of the sale period by an average of 30% and significantly decreased the depth of markdown rates. We have seen some very encouraging results. Our average unit retail prices and our gross profit dollars were both up significantly. Simultaneously, the team has continued to drive high quality expansion. In Europe, as expected, this quarter benefited from a shift in timing of wholesale shipments. However, the underlying business was also solid and our team has driven several successful quality of sale initiatives. They have been able to reduce buys for this year in a way that has protected full price selling, increased the stock turnover and if the current trend continues, will significantly reduce excess inventory at the end of the season. As a part of executing the Way Forward Plan, you will see us increasingly focus on proactively driving quality of sales up. These initiatives will include pulling back on inventory receipts, cutting lead times, strengthening our assortment and store closures. These will be some of the most important drivers in getting us back to sustainable profitable growth. Speaking of profitability, in the first quarter, operating margin was better than our guidance, however, this was driven by one time benefits that Bob will take you through in detail. Excluding this impact, the quarter was in line with our expectations. Now let me give you an update on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As you recall from Investor Day, the Way Forward Plan is built up of a consumer facing part where we are going refocus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. And the second part that is about evolving the operating model where we are developing four business engines : a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best in class sourcing, and a multi-channel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these two parts is the foundational strengthening of the leadership team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model. Let me start by sharing how we have strengthened the foundation, starting with the leadership team. Jane Nielsen, our new Chief Financial Officer will be starting right after Labor Day. I can't tell you how excited I am to soon have Jane here on the ground working next to me. Jane has the knowledge and experience to support us with driving a very strong execution. Jeff Kuster, our new Group President for the Americas, has been on the ground for a month. He has already met several of our biggest customers and started the work, together with his team, to build a value-creating plan that will get us back to high performance in North America. Halide Alag\u00f6z, our new Head of Global Sourcing, who started in early June, has already had a positive effect on the sourcing decisions we are making. She's working very closely with her team to build a best-in-class sourcing capability. Bill Campbell, our new Head of Global Supply Chain and Inventory Management, will be leaving Amazon shortly and joining us in early October. Finally, Fredrik Hjalmers, our Head of Global Expansion, started in June and has begun the work with his team to build out a global multi-brand and multi-channel expansion plan. Moving to the progress we have made in strengthening the organization. We already completed the planned right-sizing of our head count by decreasing it with 8% and reduced layers from an average of nine to six, increasing each leader's span of control. The biggest positive effect of this is that we have become leaner, faster, we'll empower the doers and reclaim the entrepreneurial culture. In addition, it drives an SG&A saving of approximately $115 million on an annualized basis already this year. Completing the planned right-sizing of the organization has given us a good start in fixing the overall cost structure and developing a disciplined financial model. We are also underway with closing the under-performing stores we identified as part of the Way Forward Plan. In the first quarter, we closed eight of the 50-plus total stores under consideration. We're also on track to getting the other targeted SG&A cost savings out during the remainder of the year. Let me now move to the consumer facing part of the Way Forward Plan and share some highlights that we are driving there. For the last few months, Valerie Hermann and the other brand presidents have been intensely centered on refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. And in doing that, we have not only been able to improve our classic iconic styles, but we have also been able to start cutting the long tail of unproductive styles. So far, we have been able to partially impact what we bought for spring 2017 with a double-digit percentage reduction in the number of SKUs across our biggest brands. The bigger impact in both evolving the product core and cutting more of the long tail will be seen for fall 2017 when we will be able to not just reduce what we buy, but also what we develop. As we discussed in June, a big value-driver that is connected to evolving our products and assortment is developing best-in-class sourcing. Just a few weeks after Halide started as our head of sourcing, she and I held a very important meeting in Asia with our key strategic suppliers where we solicited their support in driving increased quality, decreased cost and increased flexibility and speed in our sourcing. We received a very strong response from many of our suppliers and together with them, we have already started to make measurable improvements in driving quality up, costs down on comparable products and decreasing our time to market. We are also full speed ahead with shortening our lead times from 15 to nine months, and even though the full effect will not be seen for a few seasons, we will be 50% there already by the end of this year. Next year, we should be 90% of the way there. Almost equally important to cutting the overall lead times down is the work we are doing in building an eight-week test and rapid response pipeline. For this year we're just starting and by next fall we will have the capability that will enable testing on most of the new product ideas before introduction. The work of developing a demand driven supply chain has just started. Even though Bill Campbell is not starting until October, we have already adjusted our inventory levels down to better match demand and decreased excess inventory that drove excess markdowns and cannibalization. Overall inventory levels are projected to go down for the remainder of the year. In parallel to driving the execution of the Way Forward Plan, there were several important examples recently that demonstrated how we're building strength in the business from a position of unique and iconic brand strength. One of those proud moments was our presence at Wimbledon earlier this summer and another was the Olympic ceremony this last Friday where we could see team U.S.A. walk into the stadium demonstrating the strength of American iconic style. We are so proud to be able to partner up with and support the U.S. Olympic team. In conclusion, even though it's early days in the execution of our Way Forward Plan, this is a multiyear journey and we are now one quarter in, just in the beginning of the execution phase. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making. We have guided this year as a reset and stabilize year and that is what we're delivering on. We will continue to balance meeting our near term commitments with staying on track to execute our long-term Way Forward Plan. As I noted, we have made progress in a number of areas from strengthening the leadership team to starting to improve the product and assortment building, starting to cut the lead times and improving our sourcing, to the execution in the regions and the cost initiatives. I'm excited to see our teams taking on the challenges head on and we believe the company is again moving in the right direction. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. First quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion were down 4% compared to the prior-year period on both the reported and constant currency basis. This is in line with the guidance we provided this past June of a mid-single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. On adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 61.1% in the first quarter excluding noncash inventory related charges of $54 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 130 basis points above the prior-year period primarily reflecting favorable sales mix shift, lower product costs, and an improvement in Asia driven by initiatives to improve quality sale metrics. Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $821 million excluding $105 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down only 1% to last year as our head count reduction in other expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan had limited benefit in the first quarter due to the timing of these activities. Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 8.2% excluding $159 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 60 basis points below last year due to fixed expense deleverage on lower net revenues, and partially offset by higher gross margin. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in June of a 110 basis point to 160 basis point decline, driven by more favorable impact of our inventory management initiatives, specifically lower inventory reserves due to restructuring related inventory charges as well as product mix. The product mix shift was significant in Europe, and was driven by a higher level of summer product within the wholesale shipments and a higher level of made for factory product in factory stores due to less excess inventory. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $90 million or $1.06 per diluted share excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net loss in the first quarter was $22 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the first quarter, on an adjusted basis, compared to an effective tax rate of 30% in the prior-year period. Moving on to segment performance, wholesale revenues decreased 5% on both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $607 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in North America, as the U.S. department store channel continued to experience challenging traffic trends. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe, primarily driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year in addition to proactive measures taken to clear inventory. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the first quarter was 23.7% excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 190 basis points above the prior-year period driven by a higher gross margin. Retail segment sales decreased 3% in both reported and constant currency in the first quarter to $907 million. The sales decline was driven by a comparable store sales decline that was partially offset by non-comparable store sales growth. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 7% in constant currency and 6% as reported during the first quarter, primarily driven by lower traffic trends during the quarter in a challenging macro environment in most regions. Global e-commerce revenues declined 6% during the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to the company's pricing harmonization and other quality of sale initiatives. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we had 485 directly operated standalone stores and 598 concessions globally. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had 18 net new directly operated stores and 40 net new concessions shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores and 17 dedicated shops, as well as 60 Club Monaco stores and 74 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Retail operating margin in the first quarter excluding restructuring and other related charges was 13.8%, which was 120 basis points above the prior-year period due to a higher gross margin. Licensing revenues decreased 8% in both reported and constant currency, impacted by timing of shipments during the quarter. Licensing segment operating income down 7% in the first quarter compared with the prior-year period. Now I'd like to provide some color on our performance by geography in the first quarter. In the Americas net revenue declined 11% as we continued to see pressure in the U.S. department store channel. Same-store sales were down high-single digits in North America in the first quarter driven by traffic challenges. In Europe net revenues increased 14% on a reported basis and grew 15% in constant currency. This growth was mostly driven by a benefit from timing of shipments relative to last year. Excluding this shift, the underlying trend was solid in the quarter. Going forward we note that the potential impact of Brexit on consumer spending and geopolitical volatility in the region are increasing uncertainty in this market. In Asia net revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and were flat with the prior-year period in constant currency. We experienced continued growth in Japan and Australia. Same-store sales growth was negatively impacted by our ongoing strategy to improve our quality of sale metrics in the region. We continue to experience gross margin improvement and average unit retails were up significantly while markdown rates were down significantly. Now let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organizational structure and right size its cost structure and real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of up to $400 million as a result of the fiscal 2017 restructuring activities and up to $150 million inventory charge associated with the company's Way Forward Plan. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 the company recorded $104 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $50 million in inventory charges. Now moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 2% year over year. The company expects inventory quality to continue to improve on the balance sheet, as inventory clearance activities continue. Moving to capital expenditures, we spent $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $68 million in the prior-year period mostly to support our retail store network, concession shops and infrastructure projects. During the first quarter the company paid approximately $100 million related to repurchase of its Class A common stock. At the end of the quarter approximately $200 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet and $692 million of total debt. Now I'd like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring, impairment and inventory related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017 the company continues to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate due to a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and other quality of sales initiatives combined the weak retail traffic and a highly promotional environment in the U.S. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed expense deleverage. The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down mid to high-single digits on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency will have minimal impact on revenue growth in the second quarter. Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 is expected to be 200 basis points to 250 basis points below the comparable prior-year period. Initiatives under the Way Forward Plan are expected to have a greater impact in the second half of the fiscal year than the second quarter. Second quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%. With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator : The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Thanks for the update. I guess my question I want to ask \u2013 maybe for a little bit more information and insight on what you learned in Asia as you kind of improved the quality of sales there. It is a different market in terms of it is a lot more owned retail or concession model, you don't have that kind of big wholesale piece. Trying to understand \u2013 I also think the brand maybe is a little bit \u2013 the architecture is a little bit simpler in Asia. Maybe help us understand what is the difference between the Asian market, what you are learning there, and maybe what we can expect in North America, which is \u2013 because of the omni-channel wholesale brand architecture might be a different path towards elevating the quality of sales. Thanks. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yeah, thank you, Omar. The biggest changes that we've made to support and strengthen the quality of sale that we're seeing in Asia is to really significantly cut back on our promotional stance two different ways. One, significantly shortening the length of promotion. And two, just the depth of the discounting and the markdown. And what we've seen is overall from a quality of sale perspective, whether it's looking at discount rate, which has decreased significantly. We've seen a very significant increase in average unit retail. And although we've seen a more moderate decrease in UPTs, overall it's driving a stronger average transaction value for us. That's been the biggest change and the biggest benefit that we've seen from that. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : When it comes to Jeff Kuster, who just started, as I mentioned in my opening remark, he is starting with an assessment of the challenge in North America and diagnosing that in detail so we get a facts based view on what we are up against. And then we are pivoting to building a plan to increase quality of sales in North America. So differences there, Omar, coming back to your question, there are definitely differences in Asia and North America based on channel differences as being one big difference. But it comes back to how we plan the inventory, how we buy the inventory to demand, how our promotional strategy, our promotional execution and how that plays across channels. That's why the fact based diagnosis is so important. Jeff just started three, four weeks ago and he is underway with the team and will work with the different channels and that's where we're going to add the most value in this analysis, and coming back, that's what gives me the most confidence when it comes to a plan to increase quality of sales. But we are doing this for the first time cross-channel and we're going to do it together with our biggest customers as well. So we are looking forward to come back and provide our insights when we get them. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : I mean, one other thing, Omar, related to the Asia quality of sale improvement. We've also done an in-depth analysis of points of distribution and we reduced approximately 48 points of distribution in Asia this quarter that we felt really didn't properly represent the brand but at the same time we also identified a number of additional points of distribution. So, for an example, in our wholesale channel, which is a relatively small business in Asia, but we saw in the quarter a 48% increase in the number of shops in our wholesale channel, too. So it's both cutting back on promotions, whether it's depth, length, but then also making sure that we're in the correct points of distribution for the brands. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for the update on the supply chain efforts. I just wondered if you could maybe walk through some of the mechanics of how you are reducing the supply-chain lead time, especially in light of your commentary today about the 50% reduction in lead time this year and 90% by next year. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : Let's see. Yes. It's not a 50% and 90% reduction of lead time. We're moving \u2013 it's a 50% \u2013 we're going be 50% on a nine-month lead time by the end of this year and we're going be 90% on a nine-month lead time by next year. As I mentioned on the Investor Day, the biggest change here is a cultural change and it's a change of how we work as a team. So instead of working in a sequential way where you hand over function by function and by that you build in slack in the lead times and you extend the lead times, we are working together cross functionally. So, one thing that has really excited me over the first couple of months digging into the Way Forward execution with the team is to break down the silos, to have design, merchandising, sourcing, sales distribution channel at the table from the first design idea all the way in to selling the actual product. And just by that, we cut a lot of time from the lead times. And then it's about going and mapping through and Halide Alag\u00f6z is leading that work. She's mapping every single component of the current lead times and looking at how is every component and every day and hour spent adding value to driving brand strength and profitable sales growth and driving a stronger assortment. And I can say that I'm very encouraged by the facts that we are digging up, that we will be 90% on a nine-month lead time by the end of next year. Parallel to that is going be the eight-week test of rapid response pipeline because that's going be a big enabler as well that in a very short period of time we're going to be able to test any and every new big product idea before we go big. And rapid response part of that is to say when we sell something and we see a bigger demand than expected, we will be able to much faster chase back into those products. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Nice quarter. Just one near-term I guess modeling question to help us think about the year, then maybe just a longer-term question. On the model could you help us think about the planned cost-saving split between SG&A and cost of goods sold as we look at both the second quarter and the second half? I guess I thought \u2013 I guess we had a little bit upside down in our model. I thought some of the cost reductions you had already taken would have meant more SG&A leverage this quarter, maybe not as much cost of goods. And then longer-term, as you guys laid out the plan for the next four years at the Analyst Day you referred to as 2018 as revenue stabilizing. And as we look at it with the guidance you gave today we were able to do a little bit of math around the year. And we can see that the back half of the year looks like revenues will be down by mid to high teens it looks like. We know in the fourth quarter you will have to lap an Easter shift and an extra week and that you will be closing stores so it will naturally be lower. But certainly some of the drivers on why the growth rate leaving the year will be so low will extend into the first half of next year. I am trying to think if \u2013 a little bit of time has gone by now \u2013 if you could help us think about how to maybe start quantifying what your reference to stabilizing revenues will look like in fiscal 2018 given what you know about the business today as you start walking into the plan. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yeah. So thank you, Michael. Relative to your first question on the SG&A cost savings. The majority of our restructuring activities are more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. So for instance, our organizational changes were just made in June. So, you'll start to see the benefit of those in Q2, but they'll be much more heavily weighted to the second half. Of the overall savings that we discussed and quantified at the Investors Day relative to the Way Forward Plan of $445 million, that's a gross number. It doesn't represent net savings that'll drop to the bottom line, and all of those savings essentially represent SG&A savings, not cost of goods savings. So more heavily weighted to the second half related to your question on SG&A expenses, particularly as it relates to completion of our anticipated store closures. So, we communicated 50-plus closures. We're actually looking a little deeper at that number, and relative to that 50-plus, we closed eight in Q1. So again, our store closures are more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, and that's purposeful because we had committed to inventory buys for a lot of those stores and we want to be able to liquidate them through those doors. Relative to the revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, and then I'll turn the question over to Stefan to talk about the guidance for the longer-term period, the high, the mid/high teens are really being driven by, again, timing of store closures, timing related to a number of quality of sale initiatives, whether it's pulling back significantly on inventory receipts which will reduce sales, whether it's the impact of pricing harmonization within regions and channels, et cetera, and we also don't expect as much benefit from sales mix shifts as we've seen in Q1 in particular. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. And to build on what Bob just said, Michael, when it comes to the phasing of the Way Forward Plan and the financial outlook we gave on a four-year basis, if you look at \u2013 let's start with the phasing. We guided top line, from a phase perspective, to reset and stabilize 2017, moving into 2018, and then pivot to growth. And so why Q3 and Q4, why we should expect an increase in the sales \u2013 a decrease of sales in Q3 and Q4 versus the current trend, it comes back to the work Jeff and his team is doing in North America. Given how our \u2013 how big North America is of our overall business, the assessment that Jeff and his teams come back with will include several additional quality of sales initiatives. So that's why we have guided the way we have guided. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just as a quick follow up on what Jeff's team is doing. When would you think after they come back with that analysis that those implementations would be in the market? So are we talking about spring of 2017 where we might see a difference in quality of sale? Is friends and family and couponing on the table? And then just on the supply chain, the speed dynamics, you've talked about building a speed pipeline, as you mentioned, on test and react in department stores, which is pretty new. As Halide has done her work, I know she is early on, but I am just curious how that dynamic will work when you're not a vertically integrated retailer, you are relying on your third-party retail partners to get data to test and react to. So maybe just building a little bit on how that might work. Thanks. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Lindsay. So let's try to cover all your questions. So starting with Jeff and his team's work in North America, how soon you will see that come through. What I can say there is it's top priority. It's by far our top priority to assess the North American challenge. And as soon as we have clarity within the next few months, we will start to implement additional quality of sales initiatives. So we keep you posted on a more detailed schedule. But the ambition is full speed forward to assess, get the fact based and then lay out the plan and start executing it right away. So, we should see an impact at the end of this year. When it comes to friends and family and other couponing initiatives are on the table, everything is on the table. Then it's \u2013 everything is on the table, and then we look at, how do we drive brand strength and sustainable profitable sales growth in a responsible way from where we are to where we are heading. Eight-week speed pipeline. So I mentioned a few times before that coming into this role, the wholesale relationship partnership was new to me, and I was blown away by our biggest customers and their willingness to take on the challenge together with us. So, they are waiting for us to come back and say, relating to the eight week speed pipeline and a number of other areas to say how can we partner up and create joint value out of this. Because when we get into a more balanced inventory and cut most of the excess out and be able to react on eight weeks, then we will be able to create value not only for us but for them. And they are very clear on that. So we have an ongoing dialogue with them, and they are waiting for us to be ready to start to execute on it. What excites me is to see by the speed Halide and her team has come into not only assessing the state but also reaching out to the suppliers. As I mentioned, we went to Asia, Halide and I, and met with our key suppliers. The suppliers that were there represent 70% approximately of our total volume. And we invited them into co-create this journey, to co-create the sourcing part of the Way Forward Plan, which also it didn't surprise me because I'm more experienced from working closely with sourcing partners that they were more than ready to dive in. So, I've seen several concrete examples of how working differently we'll be able to increase quality, decrease the cost and increase the flexibility and the speed. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Thanks. Next question. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. So, on your wholesale reset, can you just talk a little bit about the process, how you select the doors to consolidate? Is it location volume, is it retail or partner specific? And then just more multi-year, what does your plan consider in terms of a potential larger scale department store closing? Any strategies in place just to offset the potential impact if that were to transpire?  Okay. Thanks, Matt. I'll take that question, which is \u2013 it comes back to Jeff's assessment that we need to do the fact-based assessment first. I'm a firm believer in getting the facts crystal clear on the table, put everything on the table and then look at where we're set out to go. Which is one common goal for the whole team which is in the US, for wholesale, for all channels, strengthen the brand and drive profitable sales growth and then map out the path to that. So I'll have to come back to you on the details. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just to go back to the low-double-digit sales decline outlook for the fiscal year. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the moving pieces that kind of get you there, maybe meaning how much is negative comps from your quality of sale initiatives impacting the retail side of the business versus wholesale decline as you reduce sell-in on inventory. And then maybe just specifically more detail on the North America geography within the wholesale channel for the year, would be really helpful. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yeah. So it's really driven by a combination of things, some of which I've already mentioned. Store closures plays a big role in that as it relates to the retail business. We are planning retail comps at the mid to high single digit level for the remainder of the year. In addition to that, as we said there's a number of quality of sale initiatives that are being undertaken, whether it's pulling back inventory receipts, whether it's significantly reducing promotional cadence, both timeframe and depth of those. All of that is going to drive a pullback on the revenue side of things but it will help strengthen the brand and improve our profitability going forward. Those are the main drivers. One other item worth noting, which is very significant, is pricing harmonization across all the regions. And we found as we did our deep assessment of the business and the challenges that that was a huge issue for us particularly in North America across all our channels and that's a very important initiative. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Hi, Dana. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Let's take the next one, Raya. We'll come back to Dana. Operator : Okay. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions, just first a follow-up on Europe. Could you just quantify the impact of the timing of the wholesale shift in the region during the quarter? And then I think you mentioned that North American comps were down high-single. How did comps look in Europe? And if there was any variance by region, that would be helpful. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yeah, so the impact of the timing of the wholesale shipments in the first quarter were roughly about $20 million. And then relative to the comp performance, Europe had a low single digit negative comp in the first quarter. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : And we don't really... Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): And was there any... Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : We don't break that out by region or country. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): And then if I could just follow up on the e-commerce, I think you mentioned it was down 6% in the quarter. And I realize you have got kind of the impact of the pricing harmonization. But how should we just think about that channel going forward and what is implied in your guidance in Q2 throughout the balance of the year? Thank you so much. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yeah, you should think of that guidance as mid- to high-single-digit decrease. Really again, driven particularly in North America by the pricing harmonization and the other quality of sale initiatives. We are clearly looking to be much less promotional within that channel. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. So e-commerce and brick and mortar will be down to the similar level? Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yes. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Good morning, everyone. As you think about the Way Forward Plan, Stefan, how are you seeing the product evolution evolve? What should we see as we go through the next few quarters or to the next year how you want to see the product resonate with the three brands that you are focusing on? And do price points change? Thank you. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Dana. So when it comes to the product part of the Way Forward Plan, it's all going to be about going back to the core of what made us iconic, and the core of what drives the business, and the core of what the consumer already loves. So the core for us is what we have been known for which is classic, iconic style, and how you will see that refocus and evolving the core, the work that we're doing, how you will see that is that you will gradually see it in spring 2017 and then gradually season by season you will see the core being focused on in terms of, we will make sure that we have an updated classic, iconic style that has an effortless twist that makes it current today. So it's about \u2013 you will see that the core from everything from placement to presentation to marketing, it will cut through and it will be one message and it will be a core that is updated and relevant for today. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. Next question, please. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Stefan, I just had a question on this lead time reduction. I just wondered what are the tradeoffs that you have to make as you go down that path? Obviously having shorter lead times, there is the potential of having to have higher product costs, perhaps not. But I am interested if that is part of the tradeoff. Obviously you are trying to save markdowns by being six months smarter about what you are committing to. But I was just wondering if you could kind of walk us through that. Thank you. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, David. So when it comes to tradeoffs, what's been very encouraging to see is that coming back to the work behind and the drivers behind moving from 15 to nine months to start with and adding the eight-week test pipeline, it comes very much back to the disciplined approach of working cross functionally from design idea all the way into the store, and reading the sales and responding to that. So working with Halide and her team and putting sourcing at the table upfront together with design and merchandising has led to that we have been able to move towards the nine-month lead time, have an eight-week speed, increase the quality at the same time as we see costs on comparable products go down. So Halide has, like everyone else working on the Way Forward Plan, she has started \u2013 she and her team have started focusing on the core. And that is what will make the biggest difference from a consumer perspective and from a business perspective. And very encouraging to see that we're able to cut the lead times, increase the quality, decrease the price at the same time \u2013 decrease the cost price. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. My question is about the store closures. Can you talk to us about what types of stores you're closing? Where they are? What criteria you are using to determine which stores will close? And Bob mentioned, taking a deeper look at store closures, does that mean that you're considering closing possibly more than 50 stores? Thank you. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yes. Thank you, Jay. So the criteria with which we selected stores for closure was really two fold. One was is the store strategic in strengthening the brand? And then secondly, the overall level of profitability were the major drivers, and the major criteria that we looked at. Yes. We are looking at possibly closing more than 50 stores. There were some stores that went through our initial evaluation using those criteria that we may have felt were strategic, and that we could turn the productivity around in the stores. And we're going back and just validating that and questioning that. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen and Company. John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like the Way Forward Plan is definitely gaining some momentum. Your gross margin ex restructuring charges was up pretty significantly in the first quarter. Bob, you talked about lower inventory reserves on the balance sheet, but can you help us understand what we should expect for gross margin that's embedded in your guidance for the remainder of the year? Thank you. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yeah, so, the first quarter was benefited from a few things that we consider to be kind of one time in nature, right? So one was the significant favorable sales mix shifts that we experienced from products, geography in a channel perspective. We don't see that magnitude of favorability on the go-forward. With respect to the impact on inventory reserves, and that's really a commentary relative to the guidance that we gave, that as we were working through and executing on our inventory initiatives, whether they're restructuring or other initiatives, what we found is that we did not have to record the level of inventory reserves that we had initiatively estimated when we gave our guidance. So it was just a function of refinement of our restructuring and inventory management activities that were going to be one time in nature relative to the visibility we had when we gave guidance versus how we're seeing things play out as we look at the plans materializing relative to the forecast going forward. Evren Kopelman - Head- Investor Relations : Okay. And we'll take one final question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert F. Ohmes - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Oh, Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one, I was hoping you could remind us or maybe tell us how e-commerce performed for you guys in the quarter? And maybe, Stefan, remind us where dot-com business fits into the Way Forward Plan globally and sort of what the initiatives are underway there right now? Thanks. Robert L. Madore - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Senior Vice President : Yep. So e-commerce comps were down mid single digits. We had better performance in Europe than we experienced in North America. In North America, our top line revenue was impacted by two things primarily. One again was the pricing harmonization that we talked about. And then also, cutting back on our promotions. We cut back significantly on the length of the promotions, the number of promotions and the discount rate depth relative to how we've historically operated. That's really what drove the North American performance. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : And longer term, John, in terms of the e-commerce role in the Way Forward, it's going to have a really important part. We have mentioned a number of times before that we're going to follow the consumer, where the consumer is going. The consumer is clearly going to e-commerce and mobile first. We are developing an e-commerce platform. Since a while back, we are on target to deliver that. That's going to enable us to not only build a flagship online that's highly aspirational and stands for everything that's Ralph original edition about a life in style and be very focused on the core product strategy, the icon strategy, and it's going be very shoppable at the same time. So when it comes to its role short-term here and now over the next six months, it's going to be a part of Jeff's strategy that he is developing for North America because that's multi-channel and e-commerce is going to play an important role. Stefan Larsson - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. That was the final question. I look at Evren here, and she smiles and nods. So, before we close, I just want to say, on behalf of Ralph, myself and the Board, I would like to thank Bob for all his contributions to the company over the last 12 years. It's going to be your final quarterly call. Thank you. From all of us, and to all of you, thanks for joining on the call today. Look forward to speaking again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's second quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. With me today are Stefan Larsson, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Stefan. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. Since we last spoke on our earnings call in August, the team and I have continued our intense focus on driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. The Way Forward Plan, as a reminder, is our multi-year strategy to build on the unique brand strength we have, go back to the core of what made Ralph Lauren iconic, evolve from that core and build the business back to sustainable profitable growth. We are two quarters into executing on the plan and my focus is leading our teams to ensure that every action we take today drives towards our long-term Way Forward goals, while at the same time optimizing near-term performance. Today, I will share my key learnings from the second quarter and then provide an update on our progress in driving the execution of our Way Forward Plan. Then I'm excited about having Jane here with me and will turn it to her to review the details of the company's quarterly financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2017. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver against our expectations. Our performance keeps us on track to achieve our full-year fiscal 2017 guidance, with some changes in the quarterly flow (3:13). In the second quarter, revenue of $1.8 billion was consistent with our plan, while operating margin was ahead of our target, driven by higher gross margins in our international markets, quality of sales initiatives starting to get traction and planned SG&A expenses shifting into the third quarter. Jane will take you through these in detail. Our revenue in the quarter declined in line with our plan, down 8% versus prior year, with continued and expected larger decline in wholesale than retail. Consistent with our Way Forward Plan, we continued to drive the quality of our sales up by moderating discount rates, tightening inventory buys and closing another seven underperforming stores in the quarter. These initiatives successfully reduced inventories which were down 15% to last year at the end of the quarter. North America continues to be our most challenged market where revenue declined 12% in the quarter. As I shared on our last call, assessing our North American challenge, which to a large extent is self-induced, and building and executing a plan to get back to winning in North America is one of our biggest priorities. In our international markets, revenue increased 2% in the second quarter. Our teams there continue to drive up quality of sales, right-size the inventory and optimize the store fleets to build a foundation for profitable growth. In Asia, we continued to see encouraging results of our proactive quality of sales actions. Over the last nine months, our team has now closed a total of 72 points of distribution that weakened the brand and opened 159 new high-quality points of sale. The new points of distribution have better locations, improved adjacencies and refreshed store environments relative to the locations we closed. In addition, we continue to reduce the length of the sales periods and significantly decrease the depth of markdown rates. We continued to see the positive impact of our initiatives on profitability. Over the past nine months, our average unit retail prices are up 10% in constant currency and our gross profit margin continues to expand. In Europe, growth remained solid in the second quarter and our team centered on tighter inventory management, strengthening the assortment and resulting in improved margins. Now, let me give you a few important updates on our progress on the execution of the Way Forward Plan. As we are still early in the execution of the plan, there will often be a lag time between when we take a Way Forward action and when it shows up in the P&L. However, I do see early indicators of success and I would use these calls to give you updates on the progress points of our execution. The Way Forward Plan is built on two key parts. The first is consumer-facing where we're going to focus on and evolve from the core in product, marketing and the shopping experience. The second part is about evolving the operating model where we are developing four business engines : a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment, a demand-driven supply chain, a best-in-class sourcing capability and a multi-channel global expansion strategy. Underlying both of these two parts is the foundation of strengthening the leadership team and culture, as well as developing a strong economic model. With the addition of Jane Nielsen from Coach and Bill Campbell from Amazon last quarter, we are now very close to having our full operations team in place. The only outstanding role to fill is a Global Chief Marketing Officer, and we are underway with that search. Delivering on our objective to increase our focus and resources on our core brands, we recently announced our decision to discontinue the Denim & Supply brand. We will address the denim market more effectively through our Polo brand by leveraging the brand strength of Polo. Moving on to the work of evolving the assortment in product. I'm excited about the work that Val\u00e9rie and her team are driving in cutting the product tail, refocusing our core product offering and evolving from that core. In the second quarter, we continued to make good progress in identifying and cutting the long tail of unproductive styles, leading to a big reduction in the number of SKUs. For fall 2016, we achieved a 10% reduction in SKUs across our apparel brands. And for spring 2017, we are on track to achieve over a 20% reduction. And for fall 2017, we're on the way to further SKU reductions. The style and SKU reduction frees up time, resources and creativity to focus on and evolve our core icons, leading to a more productive and desirable assortment. Our improved discipline in the assortment creation enables us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. We continue to expect to be halfway to our goal of a nine-month lead time by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. The key unlock for our shorter lead times is the fabric platforming for our core styles. We made significant progress in this area during the quarter. Almost all of our core fabrics will be platformed by the end of this month. This enables us to increase the quality of our fabric, secure better prices and decrease our lead times and increase our flexibility to react to selling in season. We can now, for the first time, work in partnership with our big customers and move from buying blind before their buys to buying our inventory based on their buys, and therefore, significantly improve matching our inventory to the real demand. In the second quarter, we continued to drive down inventory levels across the company to get closer to matching inventory we demand. In addition to our inventory restructuring actions, I am pleased with our meaningful progress to reduce inventory buys. Although we're still in the early stages of this journey, optimizing our buys should improve sell-throughs and gross margin rate. Now, I want to share our plan to come back to high-performance in North America. North America is our largest market and one where it's essential for us to return to profitable growth. The plan is based on leveraging our unique brand strength, solid market position, and strong relationships with our wholesale partners. As we mentioned on our last call, Jeff Kuster joined in July as our new Group President for the Americas. Together with his team, Jeff has worked through a detailed fact-based assessment of our North American challenges. From that assessment, we have built a plan that will take us back to strength. And strength in North America starts with our U.S. wholesale business. The challenges we face there are similar to our overall challenges as a company that we shared during our Investor Day in June. We have been buying too much inventory, letting that overflow to value channels, buying too much in the product tail, buying too early before the customers have bought, not created room to chase in season, and distributed too much in the low-volume shops, and promoted too deep and too frequently. To start building strength back, we will work even more closely with our biggest wholesale customers, partnering together with them to build strength that will make us both drive high performance. Together, we will : first, reduce our overall buys to better match demand. This will reduce the overflow of inventory going to value channels. Second, cut the product tail and refocus the investments in the evolved core. This will improve inventory productivity. Third, we will cut supplier lead times. This will allow our customers to buy much closer in and improve the flexibility to chasing season. Fourth, we will refocus our marketing efforts, in line with our Way Forward Plan, to develop cut-through marketing campaigns for our main brands. This will be targeted to drive traffic and conversion. Our first initiatives will start with Polo in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Fifth and finally, working in collaboration with our partners, we will reduce and close the tail of our distribution, which accounts for 20% to 25% of the total distribution points. These shops represent a very small share of sales and profit for us as well as our partners. Just as with assortment, we will refocus on and evolve from the core, which means the top-selling doors, and invest in refreshing and rebuilding the store experience. This will create an exciting shopping experience and supercharge the evolved assortment strategy. It's worth mentioning again that we believe in a strong wholesale channel and a well-executed department store. We believe a well-curated department store offers a convenient and exciting shopping experience that saves the consumer time, while also bringing them into the brand. Our distribution plan will follow the consumer and department stores off and online represent one of the largest channels the full-price consumer shops today and in the near future. Parallel to strengthening our wholesale efforts, we're also strengthening our e-commerce presence. But even though department stores represent one of the biggest channels for our consumers, the e-commerce channel has the highest growth rate and is increasingly important. Our assessment of our e-commerce challenges and our plan to strengthen e-commerce are also very much in line with our overall Way Forward assessment and plan. We are reducing the overall buys, we are reducing the promotions, we are reducing the product tail, we are refocusing on and evolving our core products, and we'll start to present them in an evolved and refreshed way. We have taken the first steps here and you can now see our refreshed landing pages on both our mobile as well our desktop sites. We recently launched our redesigned mobile site, which features significant improvements in functionality. We improved the checkout process, navigation, and creative execution, and many more steps to follow on that. Finally, a few words on marketing. In September, we held our first ever See-Now-Buy-Now runway show for the women's collection. The show was held in a glass structure on the sidewalk outside our Madison Avenue flagship. We even managed to close down Madison Avenue for a few hours. It was a big success and generated more than twice the global media value compared to the previous season's show. We also recently launched a Ralph Lauren Icons campaign in our women's luxury business. It's built on our Way Forward goal to refocus on and evolve from core iconic products to make them even more desirable to today's consumer. The response so far has been very positive. In conclusion, we are making good progress against our Way Forward Plan. While most of it is still to be done, I'm excited with what I see. During the last three months, while we have been getting ready to execute the holiday season, I've been traveling extensively and spent much time with our teams and our biggest customers. From my perspective, whether I'm in Little Rock, Arkansas with our friends at Dillard's, or seeing our newly renovated flagship store come to life on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, or visiting our new Polo store on Regent Street in London, I feel the excitement from our teams and partners that we're starting to move towards unlocking the true potential of this great brand that Ralph started almost 50 years ago. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with all of you and to be a part of the Ralph Lauren team. I'm excited about executing our Way Forward Plan and sharing our progress with you. Second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion were down 8% to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our quality of sales initiatives starting to take hold and is in line with the guidance we provided in August of mid- to high-single-digit revenue decline. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on revenue growth in the second quarter. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 56.9% in the second quarter, excluding non-cash inventory-related charges of $81 million associated with our restructuring activities. This was 40 basis points above prior year, primarily driven by favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, improved product costing and initiatives to improve quality of sale, primarily through reduced promotional activity in our international businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 80 basis points. Operating expenses on an adjusted basis were $809 million, excluding $69 million in restructuring and other related charges. These expenses were down 4% compared to last year, primarily as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including head-count reductions and seven store closures. Store closures in the second quarter were lower than expectations. We delayed closures to take advantage of the peak holiday shopping period and to minimize store closure costs through negotiations with our landlords. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 12.4%, excluding $150 million in restructuring and other related charges. This was 110 basis points below last year due to fixed cost expense de-leverage on lower net revenues, which was partially offset by our improved gross margin. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in August of a 200-basis-point to 250-basis-point decline. This was primarily driven by improved gross margin in our international markets and a change in the timing of about $12 million of planned SG&A expense, which benefited the second quarter and will shift into the third quarter. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $158 million or $1.90 per diluted share, excluding restructuring and other related charges. On a reported basis, net income in the second quarter was $45 million or $0.55 per diluted share. The effective tax rate was 29% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis, similar to the effective tax rate of 29% in the prior-year period. Moving on to segment performance. Wholesale revenues decreased 10% to $831 million on both a reported and constant currency basis in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in North America, as shipments were strategically reduced as a part of the Way Forward Plan. This was partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Europe. Adjusted wholesale operating margin in the second quarter was 26.4%, excluding restructuring and other related charges. This was 40 basis points below prior year. Retail segment sales decreased 5% to $942 million on a reported basis and were down 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a comparable store sales decline. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 9% in constant currency and 8% as reported, primarily due to challenging traffic and average dollar transaction trends. Similarly, global e-commerce revenues declined 7% during the quarter on a reported basis and 6% in constant currency, driven by our price harmonization initiatives. Retail operating margin in the second quarter, excluding restructuring and other related charges, was 11.8%, which was 100 basis points below the prior-year period. Licensing revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat in constant currency. Licensing segment operating income increased 5% in the second quarter compared with the prior-year period. Turning to distribution. At the end of the second quarter, we had 485 directly-operated standalone stores and 620 concessions globally. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company had five net new directly-operated stores and 44 net new concession shops at the end of this second quarter. In addition, our international licensing partners operated 102 Ralph Lauren stores and 20 dedicated shops, as well as 59 Club Monaco stores and 77 Club Monaco concession shops at the end of the second quarter. We continued to close underperforming doors that we identified as a part of the Way Forward Plan. In the second quarter, we closed seven standalone stores, bringing the total for the first half to 15 store closures as a part of our restructuring activity. These stores were geographically dispersed and primarily in our full-price concept. For the full year, we still expect to close approximately 50 stores. More of the closures are now slated for the fourth quarter, after the holiday period. We continue to take a pragmatic approach to closures, balancing closure timing with realizing peak holiday season sales volume, and minimizing door closure costs. Additionally, we continue to right-size our cost structure and expect to make continued progress as we close out our fiscal year. Now, let me provide you with an update on our restructuring activities related to the Way Forward Plan. The company continues to expect restructuring activities to result in approximately $180 million to $220 million of annualized expense savings related to its initiatives to streamline the organization structure and right-size the cost structure, and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio. We continue to expect restructuring charges of about $400 million as a result of our Way Forward Plan, and about $150 million in inventory charges related to our restructuring activities. These charges are expected to be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recorded $150 million in restructuring-related impairment and inventory charges. Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory was $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 15%, or $200 million compared to the end of the prior-year period. The reduction was attributable to both restructuring actions and about 40% due to our operating process initiatives to reduce inventory, including a proactive pullback in receipts and our early efforts to move towards a demand-driven supply chain. Our progress in the second quarter increases our confidence that inventory will continue to show double-digit declines for the remainder of the year, and inventory quality will continue to improve. Moving on to capital expenditures. We spent $87 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $134 million in the prior-year period, mostly to support our retail store network and infrastructure projects. During the second quarter, approximately 80,000 shares of Class A common stock were retired as a part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program the company initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There were no new share repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, $200 million remained available for future share repurchases. We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, and $692 million of total debt. I'd like to now turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company's Way Forward Plan. For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect consolidated net revenues to decrease at a low-double-digit rate, as we execute our Way Forward Plan. Key elements include a proactive pullback in inventory receipts, store closures, pricing harmonization and quality of sale initiatives. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. The company continues to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts in gross margin and SG&A, infrastructure investments and fixed expense de-leverage. Fiscal 2017 tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%. For the third quarter, the company expects consolidated net revenues to be down low-double digits to down low-teens on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue growth, but should pressure gross margin by at least 120 basis points. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 200 to 225 basis points below the comparable year-prior period. Key pressure points are FX pressures to gross margin and the shift in timing of about $12 million of planned operating expenses from the second to the third quarter. In addition, savings initiatives from the Way Forward Plan will be more fully realized in the fourth quarter, as more store closures are slated for after the holiday period. The third quarter tax rate is estimated at 29%. In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our Way Forward Plan. We have the key elements in place to ensure continued progress. We have strong and collaborative relationships with our wholesale partners, a strong brand, a strong balance sheet, and a motivated and committed team of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. With that, I'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator : The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the progress. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Omar. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Omar. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Sure. Yeah, I wanted to ask, I mean, kind of a macro question. It's super turbulent out there still, a lot of moving pieces from a top-down perspective in the markets on a global basis. You're making progress on the Way Forward Plan. How do you think about your ability to stick to that plan and for the plan to hold up, given all the changes and turbulence in the marketplace, both from a near-term and a long-term perspective? Thanks. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Omar. Well, my perspective has always been and will be that the highest performing companies and management teams out there are focused on what they can influence. So, when we look at the Way Forward Plan, it's largely within our control. So, independently of macro environment, it's the same macro environment for us as for all of our competitors, we are focused as a management team to execute on our plan. And that's what both Jane and I and the management team are excited about, is to see the progress that we are making in executing from going from developing the plan to executing the plan, that we are seeing that we are making progress in all the areas that we set out to make progress with. And so, independently of where the environment is going, we are going to stay focused, increase our focus on what we can control, and continue to drive and continue to learn and improve and learn and improve. So, that's my philosophy. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning and congrats on the progress. And, Jane, it's nice to hear you back. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Michael. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Let me just ask you two quick questions. You have a lot of moving parts on the retail side, but with some of the store closures pushing into fourth quarter, I think it's important to kind of think about the change in the cadence in terms of what that means looking out past your fiscal 2017. It probably means we'd expect to see some of the year-over-year impact of those closures more focused in the first half of 2018, if that's safe to assume. Can you help us fine-tune the guidance for revenues that were going to be stabilizing in fiscal 2018 based on that change and how we can think about magnitude? And then, just on the gross margin for our models in the third quarter, can the gross margin in the third quarter actually be positive year-over-year if we include that 120-basis-point drag from currency that you mentioned, Jane? Thanks. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah. So, Michael, as you look at it, we have looked at those store closures. As I said, we're going to be very pragmatic about capturing holiday season sales and negotiating the best deals possible with our landlords. Obviously, if we close at the end of the year, there will be a spillover effect on growth into FY 2018 from store closures. But remember, those stores are smallest and least productive doors. So, while that will be a factor and we'll play that into our initiatives, overall our guidance for FY 2018 that we will see stabilization is still intact. As we did with the North America comeback plan, we are working through 2018 on an initiative-by-initiative basis, and we'll come back to you in the fourth quarter, as is our practice, and give you much more specific guidance on that. And then, as you look at the third quarter overall in terms of gross margin, here's what I see in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds that we saw in the second quarter of the benefit of product and channel mix, and the benefit of markdown rates, notably in our international markets, those are going to be intact as we move into quarters three and four. The headwind, as you saw in Q2, will be FX, and it will increase. We are at 80 basis points in Q2. It's going to go up to about 120 basis points in Q3. But I still remain optimistic about our ability to move through on a conservative basis to hold, or even grow, gross margin. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Great. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question was on the discontinuation of Denim & Supply. How that could impact the sales outlook as well for next fiscal year? And how should we think about that space in the department stores? It seems to have pretty good real estate and prevalent space in the department store. How should we think about what that will look like going forward? Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Jane do you want to start for the Denim &... Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah. Just overall, in terms of Denim & Supply, as we looked at that brand, it's a pretty small portion of our revenue. It's about 2% of global net sales. So it's not a material impact. And further, as we've looked at our portfolio of brands, we think we have a great opportunity in Polo and in Denim specifically to recapture those sales over time. So we feel really good about continuing the plan of refocusing on the core, stretching our very strong brands like Polo to pick up the opportunity that we had in Denim & Supply, and to move forward from there. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And when it comes to the space in department stores, what's been important for myself and the team when we work on the North American comeback is that it's about the partnership with our wholesale customers, and we have had that from day one. So our space in the department stores comes back to our brand strength, our strong market share with the consumer, and our ability to come back to strength. And what excited me from day one is the excitement from the wholesale partners in driving these initiatives that will drive us jointly back to high performance. One being the shorter lead times, being able to buy much closer in and being able to react to the sales trend in season. That's something that's viewed very favorable by our partners and they have, frankly, been waiting for us to get our assessment done and get going. And now we're in the exciting stage of getting going together. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a quick housekeeping question for Jane. Given some of the volatility in currency, I was curious if \u2013 I don't think the outlook for FX impact on revenue has changed much, but has your view on the impact of gross profit or earnings changed at all? In other words, is there more of a headwind embedded in your updated guidance or is it consistent? And then my bigger question for Stephan is \u2013 thank you for the initial detail on Jeff's thoughts on the North American comeback. You talked about cutting 20% to 25% of your sort of tail distribution points. Can you talk about the complexion of those changes retail versus wholesale? Whether that involves additional store closures of above and beyond what you've already announced? And how you plan to reinvest more aggressively in the core areas that you're sticking with? Thanks. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah, Lindsay, as we looked at FX impact, we have seen an impact overall to FX, and largely it's playing out in terms of gross margin. Our guidance is still intact. We are accommodating that change within our operations. But as I look at operating profits, foreign currency will have about 100-basis-point impact to overall operating margin for the full year. Do you want to do the 20% to... Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes. So, when it comes to the 20% to 25%, cutting the tail of the distribution in wholesale, it's the shops. It's the bottom 20%, 25%, the least productive shops. So, even though it's a high number in terms of share of the shops being cut, it's a very low number in terms of sales and even lower number in terms of profit, both for ourselves and our partners. So it follows the same strategy as the assortment strategy. It goes back to the core, and the core doors and the core shops for us are very important. And we're going to refocus our energy there and making sure that we provide an outstanding shopping experience there, and that will drive our comeback. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Jane, welcome. Congratulations. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Bob. Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC : The question that I have is, can you talk a little bit about tourism trends both in the U.S. and in your international stores and how that's impacting the results? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah, Bob. As we've looked at foreign tourist trends overall, we continue to see a decline in overall tourist traffic. But I will tell you, both in the first and the second quarter, we've seen an improvement. Although they're still down, we've seen an improvement versus prior year. So it's not as severe as it was, but we do still see that traffic down, and it's most notable in our outlet business. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome aboard, Jane. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just curious, so wholesale down 10% in Q2. I think North America in Q1 was down around mid-teens. I'm just curious if you could comment on what the North America piece of wholesale looked like in the second quarter. And then, just for the back half, to hit your plan for the year, what you're kind of expecting out of the North America wholesale channel as well? Thank you. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah. Overall, Ike, we do see that North America \u2013 one of the reasons that we focused the North America comeback plan to high performance, the first phase is on wholesale is because it's so important to our business and we're not satisfied with the overall trends. So, as we continue to focus on pulling back inventory, closing doors, moving back from the heavy promotional activity, we expect to see continued pressure in that North America wholesale business and that was contemplated in our guidance. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Steven Zaccone - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. This is Steve Zaccone on for Matt today. Thanks very much for taking our questions. I had a question, your second-quarter comps came in slightly below our model. Just looking for the full year, to hit your top-line guidance, how should we think about comps in the second half of the year? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Well, we are holding to our overall comp guidance of down mid- to high-single digits. So I think you can do the math and you'll see a little bit of an uptick in the second half. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the progress. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Hi, Dana. Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi. Jane, welcome. Jane, as you think about turnarounds you've done in the past, what's most similar or dissimilar compared to what you've executed in the past? And how do you see the progress here? And Stefan, how do you look at the three brands that you're focusing on, the difference between price and margins, as you continue to evolve the business? Thank you. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah, Dana. I'd say that one of the things that when I came into Ralph Lauren that pleasantly surprised me is this is an organization that's really ready for change. And although Stefan unveiled the Way Forward Plan in June, I think the organization has embraced it enthusiastically. The difference between from what I see at Ralph Lauren is that we have to work in partnership with our wholesale partners in order to effect this comeback that we've outlined. I think, as we unveiled the North America comeback plan, that is certainly our intent. So the need for partnership is one of the most notable things that I see. But, overall, obviously with the early signs of progress, I'm very encouraged. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And, Dana, when it comes to our brands and our progress within our brands and my thoughts connecting through pricing and margin there. So, as I shared in the opening remarks, I'm excited by the work that Val\u00e9rie and the brand teams are doing in being very strategic in identifying the unproductive product tail, the assortment tail, and cutting that. And we see and measure the progress on that. But that's just an enabler to then put more focus and more creativity and to refocus on executing the core. And then, thirdly, it will be about adding strategic newness. And so it should have a positive margin affect. And as of now, we are early into the execution of the plan and I see the brand teams taking the steps that are necessary for us to unlock the strength in the assortment. So I'm excited even though it's early days. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Hello. Congratulations. And I'd like to ask what your plans are on the outlet side of the business. The penetration of outlets is increasing as store closures start. How do you think about the health of that outlet business and the potential for that outlet business and the mix over the long-term? Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes. So my take on outlet is that it's an important channel for us and it's an important channel to keep in balance with the full-price selling. So, as we have mentioned before, our outlet presence in North America, given that that's our biggest market, is not high in relation to many other very strong brands and high-performing brands. So what we are doing is two things when it comes to outlet. We are making sure that we keep outlet in balance with the rest of the channels, so that we can deliver on our overall Way Forward goals, which is to strengthen our brand and drive sustainable profitable sales growth. And in parallel, we are optimizing the outlet business that we have. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah. And I would say that so many of the Way Forward Plan initiatives, the improvement of product assortment, buying closer in to demand are going to benefit the outlet channels, breakthrough marketing, are all going to benefit the outlet channel as well. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And one of our strengths as a brand is the masspirational appeal of what Ralph and the team have created over some 50 years that it appeals to absolute luxury, as you can see on the runway show that we had where we went back to the DNA, the mansion on Madison Avenue, and added newness and we created 2, 2.5 times the media value. And then we have aspirational luxury in Polo and then we have entry through our outlets. So the strength for us is that appeal to every part of the market and our job as a management team is to keep the right balance. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. My question is about your retail business. Can you talk about how unit demand has changed as the ASPs have gone up? And has that met your expectations and have you tested different ASPs to see how demand is impacted as prices change? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah. So what we've seen, Jay, is we are always testing pricing. Pricing is such an important lever in our market. And what we've seen in Asia, where we've seen our AURs go up or ASPs go up 10%, is that we've been able, if I take outdoor closures, is that we've been able to hold on to most of our unit demand. And so, that's really the sweet spot for us. Obviously, this Way Forward Plan is predicated on a long-term rise of AURs, but we'll take those sequentially over time as we're largely happy with our price points. But that is a part of the Way Forward Plan. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the wholesale strategy in North America. Could you just quantify the sales volume of that 20% to 25% doors that you're closing and then the timeframe of shuttering those doors? And then, secondly, related to that strategy, you talked about further partnering with your top wholesale accounts, but reducing product going to value, or value channels. With that as the context, how do you view the role of T.J.Maxx going forward? Thanks. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So, Erinn, as I look at the volumes in, what I'm calling, what we're saying is the tail of our distribution, that 20%, 25% of the doors. It's about 1% of overall sales, so not a material amount of sales. And obviously it's not a material amount of sales, and it's our least profitable points of distribution in the wholesale doors. And we've really taken time to look across the wholesale doors and look at points of distribution. Obviously, we have a portfolio of brand, look at points of distribution within the department store, and go in surgically to eliminate the least profitable and lowest sales points of distribution even within the door. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And when it comes to the distribution overall, including off-price, our distribution strategy is to follow where the consumer is going and keeping the balance between the different channels. And one way of improving the quality of sales and improving the full-price channels' performance is to reduce the buys. So it's the number one driver in the North American comeback is to reduce our overall inventory buys to better match demand. And the way we reduce them is one is reducing them to demand and buying closer in, it's a way of reducing, and being more accurate and having to buy less. So our idea is to buy less and sell more at the higher AUR. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah. And Erinn, right now we're working with our wholesale partners on this effort to cut the door tail and we're adjusting our buys, as we speak, to make sure that that's fully incorporated into our buys. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. We'll take one last question, and then come back for closing remarks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen & Company. John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Welcome, Jane. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, John. John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC: Stefan, I know the Way Forward Plan, two of the four key pillars did center around sourcing and supply chain. So I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of product costs and your ability to bring product costs down as we look into spring 2017. And can you just comment on product costs and any direction there, and the impact on gross margin would be helpful? Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So it's probably a combination between Jane and I. But I can start in terms of I'm very pleased with seeing how our sourcing teams are rising to the Way Forward challenge, and sourcing starting to become a strategic value driver for us. So, one very concrete progress that we have made there is to platform our fabric. So, when we platform and consolidate our fabric of our core products, we can get a number of benefits at the same time. We increased the quality, to start with, because we are going to compete with quality. So we increased quality. We increased our ability to negotiate the better cost price for that fabric. And we increased our flexibility and can shorten our lead times dramatically. So, that's just one of a number of sourcing initiatives that we are driving that will have a direct impact on the P&L over time. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah. Just in terms of gross margin, so I looked at this quarter sort of in biggest impact. Our biggest impact was the favorable geographic and channel mix. Improved product costing was our second most favorable impact, followed by initiative to reduce markdowns, especially in our international market. I do view this as a long-term tailwind for us. Obviously, given the current long cycle times, it'll play out over time. But I do view it as something that we'll see as a favorable tailwind to gross margin. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: This is something that Halide and the team, the sourcing team, they are also taking a partnership approach with our best suppliers and partnering up with them to unlock joint value. And we are seeing good progress on their work. John Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. Stefan Larsson - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So, that was the question. So, in closing, I would like to say that I'm excited by the good progress of starting to execute our Way Forward Plan. I'm very grateful for how the team has embraced this and how we step-by-step start to execute and drive improvements and learn from those improvements. So this will be a continuous improvements journey that we just started, but I'm very excited by that. Excited also by the North American comeback plan that we have a strategy to come back to strength in North America. And I'm pleased that we're keeping the guidance that we set out during the Investor Day. So, with that, I would like to thank you for joining the call today and look forward to speak with you in a quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

And now, I will turn the call over to Stefan. Stefan Larsson : Thank you, Evren, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the release this morning, the company and I mutually agreed to part ways and I want to take a brief moment to give you some context. Ralph and I, both love and respect to DNA of this great brand and we recognize the need to evolve. However we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer facing parts of the business. I want everyone on the call, shareholders and analysts to know that the Board, Ralph and I have over the last month work very hard to find common ground. After many serious conversations with one another, we mutually agree to part ways. None of these changes how proud I am of all the progress we have made against the goals we laid out in our Way Forward Plan in June. As I shared then the Way Forward Plan is about refocusing on the core of what made us iconic in evolving that core for today, to strengthen the brand and return the company to long-term profitable growth. Both Ralph and the Board are committed to continue the execution of our plan. We are on track to deliver on our commitments. A key driver to this is our strength and management team and their ability to drive high quality execution. Together we have already created a strong foundation, one that puts us in a position to continue to deliver. Our progress includes, the strengthening of the leadership team, refocusing on our core brands, starting to evolve our iconic products and marketing, matching inventory to demand, drastically reducing lead times, creating a more nimble organizational structure, beginning to right size the store fleet, achieving the initial cost reductions, and as we learned from our recent global employee survey, we have substantially improved the employee engagement and understanding of the strategy. When Jane later in this call will speak about the progress we have made in the third quarter, you will hear how these initiatives are starting to show up in the company\u2019s P&L. I remain very confident that the way forward framework has the ability to drive the company back to high performance and I will stay on until May 1, to ensure the uninterrupted execution. Before I turn it over to Jane, for her to review the progress we have made on the Way Forward Plan in the quarter, I want to say a few words about her. As I begin my transition she will take charge of the execution of our plan. Jane and I have been co-pilots since she joined and we will work closely together to make this transition successful. She has the credibility, the experience and the trust from Ralph and the Board; I could not be more confident in her ability to deliver. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jane. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone. Before I review our performance and future outlook, I want to reiterate that our foundation is strong. As Stefan said, we worked very closely since I joined, and we will continue that partnership through his extended transition period to ensure that our progress is uninterrupted. With the support of Ralph, the Board and together with our leadership team, I am committed to leading our continued execution. We are as focused as we have ever been on delivering the Way Forward Plan to strengthen the brand and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. Now on to our performance, first let\u2019s review the progress we made this quarter in executing the Way Forward Plan, starting with product for fall 2017. First, we refocused and evolved our iconic core product offering. We updated our color palette, materials, and fits, incorporating more consumer insights and marketplace intelligence into our decision making. Second, we improved our discipline in applying a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment. This means being very clear on what we are testing, what we are growing and what icons we are reinventing. This has enabled us to cut the long tail of unproductive styles delivering a double digit reduction in the number of SKUs we have designed for fall 2017, resulting in a much more focused, productive assortment and lower development costs. Third, our improved disciplined in the assortment creation is enabling us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments. Our premarket commitments for next fall is down significantly to last year. For Polo, we committed to only 15% of our buys premarket, before our wholesale customers place their orders. Last year, this figure was 60%. As a result we are buying much more informed which will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand. The initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our fall product has been very positive. Fourth, we are well underway to build a best-in-class sourcing capability and a demand driven supply chain. We remained on track to reach our goal of a nine month lead time. We continue to expect to get half way there by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year. This quarter we achieved our goal of having all our core fabrics platformed for the upcoming fall 2017 season, which enables us to make further progress in cutting our lead times. Moving on to marketing, we are making good progress in our search for a Chief Marketing Officer. In the meantime we are preparing for our first cut through Polo marketing campaign for summer. For this past fall holiday season we launched the Ralph Lauren Icon Marketing campaign, which was built on our goal to refocus on and evolve our core iconic products and luxury. The campaign was very well received and we will be launching the second part of the campaign later this month. Moving on to our financials for the quarter, we continued to deliver against our commitments. We increased our quality of sales by moderating discount levels, lowering our inventory to align supply with demand and reducing our lead times. As you saw in our press release revenues declined 12%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 12.8%. On a constant currency basis adjusted operating margin was up about 40 basis points to last year. Additionally non-GAAP operating margin expanded in constant currency, in both the retail and wholesale segments. The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in November, largely driven by gross margin and proactive expense management. Adjusted gross margin expanded by a 140 basis points, versus last year driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and initiatives to improve quality of sale including reduced promotional activity across our businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately a 100 basis points. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other related charges were down 7% compared to last year, as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, process changes and product development to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet. In North America, across our businesses the team started to execute against the plan we shared last quarter to come back to high performance. North America continues to be our most challenged market. Revenue declined 15% in the quarter led by a plan decline in wholesale. We strengthened our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and right size our inventory levels. In addition we started to rebalance our distribution in our off-price wholesale business. We also executed these important quality of sale initiatives in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. These actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our e-commerce site. E-commerce has been our most over promoted channel and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channel and reduce promotion depth. These are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to high performance in North America. They are difficult but necessary actions to build a healthy base to grow from. We expect these actions to continue through the first half of fiscal 2018. In Europe store comps improved in the third quarter despite lower markdowns as we continued to deliver on our quality of sales initiative. Our Europe team continued to drive substantial improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in constant currency. Revenue was down 6% in constant currency and 12% on a reported basis. As expected we shifted $18 million of wholesale shipments to the fourth quarter to better align with demand in our wholesale doors. Excluding this shift revenue would have been close to flat in constant currency. In our retail business in Europe we reduced promotion, drove up AURs and expanded gross margins significantly on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. Our team continues to focus on tighter inventory management and strengthening the assortment going forward. Similarly in Asia, we drove significantly lower markdown rates in each channel and expanded margins. Revenue was down 1% in constant currency and up 4% on a reported basis. Comp growth was positive in Asia in the third quarter. Going forward, we are focused on returning to revenue growth in Asia, as new distribution growth offsets closures. Moving to comparable store sales, on a global basis, comps decreased 4% in constant currency. As a reminder the high volume week after Christmas was included in the company\u2019s third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter last year, with a positive impact of approximately 2.5 percentage points, which will pressure comps in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Easter will shift into the first quarter of FY 2018. The combined effect of these two calendar shifts will pressure fourth quarter comps approximately 3 percentage points. Moving to global e-commerce, revenues declined 9% in constant currency, the e-commerce decline is driven by our initiatives in the U.S. that I just took you through. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue to pressure the first half of fiscal 2018. Turning to our store fleet, we are on track to close approximately 50 stores this year. We closed 12 stores in the third quarter and 27 year-to-date. This puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identified from store closures of approximately $70 million. Importantly, we are also on track with our total savings target. At this time restructuring charges are forecasted to be about $400 million and inventory charges about a $150 million associated with the company\u2019s Way Forward Plan. In this quarter, we recorded $91 million in restructuring related impairment and inventory charges. Moving on to the balance sheet, our progress with the Way Forward Plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the third quarter, inventory declined 23% to $984 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both, restructuring actions and our operating process initiatives, including a proactive pull back in receipts and moving towards a demand driven supply chain. We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash in investments and $589 million of total debt. Now I\u2019d like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder this guidance excludes restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company\u2019s Way Forward Plan and severance-related payments associated with the CEO departure announced today. For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance. We continue to expect revenues to decrease at a low double digit rate, as we execute the Way Forward Plan. Based on our current exchange rates foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. We also continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017, to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed costs deleverage. The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down mid-teens on a reported basis. This compares 13 weeks this year to 14 weeks last year. The 53rd week last year, contributed approximately $72 million of net revenue including $10 million in the wholesale segment and $62 million in the retail segment, as well as $12 million of operating income. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about a 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and will pressure gross margin by approximately 70 basis points. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 6% to 6.5%. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by about a 100 basis points. The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%. We now expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 to be approximately $325 million, down $50 million from our previous guidance of $375 million and we increased our rigor and focus on return on investment. Regarding share repurchases year-to-date we have repurchased a $100 million of our stock and we plan to execute another $100 million in the fourth quarter to reach $200 million for the full year, consistent with our communication in June. Our expectations for fiscal \u201818 are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day in June. We continue to expect the magnitude of revenue decline to stabilize and be less than the declines in fiscal \u201817. Currently we are forecasting revenue in fiscal \u201818 to decline high single-digits in constant currency. This includes 200 basis points of pressure from our actions in right sizing our distribution in both wholesale and retail and another 200 basis points from the previously announced closure of denim in supply. These actions will be taken in conjunction with our quality of sales and price harmonization initiatives. We expect our trend to improve in the second half of the year as we move forward in the execution of the Way Forward Plan. We expect operating margin to expand in fiscal \u201818 in constant currency, driven by both gross margin and operating cost improvement. We plan to provide more specific guidance for fiscal \u201818 on our fourth quarter call in May as is our practice. In summary, we have created a strong foundation and we are delivering our Way Forward Plan commitments. As I look ahead with the support of Ralph, the Board and together with our leadership team we have the key elements in place to ensure our continued progress. With the passion and commitment of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe we will intensify our execution of the plan, which will strengthen our brand and return us to long term profitable growth. With that I want to turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks. Stefan Larsson : Thank you, Jane. In closing while I'm disappointed that I will not be here to see the Way Forward Plan completely implemented, I'm confident that we have built a strong foundation and have the right team in place to continue to deliver on what we set out in June. I truly believe that this brand and this team have the potential to do amazing things. And I expect them to take the Way Forward Plan and make it even stronger. This has been a great opportunity for me. I'm glad I made a decision to join the company. I've learned a lot and I look forward to what\u2019s next. Now let\u2019s open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Good morning, nice quarter, good progress. Stefan\u2026 Evren Kopelman : Thanks Omar. Omar Saad : Are you willing to discuss in more detail about some greater level of insight about yours and Ralph\u2019s views differed? I know I'm asking you to talk about some disagreements you may have had with this American icon on how to improve the company that it sounded but you both have really successful track records in the industry. It\u2019s really important, I think, for investors to have some insight to what you wanted to do with that he didn't, especially since we don\u2019t have access to Ralph. Thanks. Stefan Larsson : Thanks Omar and I understand the question. First I just wanted to say that I\u2019ve deep respect for Ralph and the Board, and let\u2019s start with what we agree on. We both share a deep respect and love for the DNA of the brand. We both agree that we need to evolve and that\u2019s why we set out on the Way Forward Plan which both Ralph and the Board supports. What it came down to Omar was that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer facing parts of the company, and the most detailed I can be, is to just say is it comes down to decisions relating to how to evolve those areas, products, marketing, shopping experience and we really worked hard. And I spent my whole career, 20 years in family controlled businesses. So we worked hard to find common grounds. We didn't and that\u2019s what led to this mutual decision that we communicated today. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Patel with CLSA. Rick Patel : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. As you look at, as we think about what you\u2019ve accomplished so far and what\u2019s left to do, can you talk about the potential for longer term margin recovery. I know there's a lot of changes going on in the business right now. And you have an updated outlook for fiscal 2018, so as we think about all these moving pieces, do you still think you can get to mid-teens margins over the long run as you execute this plan or does that remain to be seen? Jane Nielsen : Rick, I think we have confidence in the guidance that we laid out in the Way Forward Plan in June, both for 2018 and beyond, in 2019 and 2020. Our commitment is to get to profitable growth. It will be a combination of topline growth and in the near term gross margin expansion and leveraging a better and more efficient cost structure. So we do see gross margin expansion. You\u2019ve seen past several quarters that we've had favorable trend in gross margin. In this quarter, if you look at it around a constant currency basis, we expand a gross margin by 240 basis points. Obviously, we had a 100 points of pressure from foreign currency, but we've got a benefit from about half of the 140 points was the benefit from channel and geographic mix, I expect that to continue. And then importantly a little less than half of our gross margin expansion came directly from our quality of sales initiatives. We across our businesses, we reduced promotion and discount levels and we're able to pull that through in terms of gross margin. So I do see that as a durable tailwind for us as we move into the future. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti : Hey guys, good morning. Stefan, I wanted to dovetail off Omar\u2019s question a little bit and just ask, as you look at it, maybe not as much about the disagreements at hand, but I think it would help everyone on this call a little bit if we could hear, which parts of the Way Forward Plan related to the areas where you have disagreement, could be on or off the table going forward, i.e. for holding the plan similar to where it was, what\u2019s changing along the path to get there that you laid out last year? And secondly, Jane as we look ahead to fiscal 2018, with the high level of guidance you guys helped us with revenues down high single-digits, that almost the same decline as we saw this year, and you had a lot of fixed cost deleverage. We know about half of the SG&A savings, you said next year would - you said last year would occur in fiscal 2018, but how do you get to the operating margin leverage next year with that high level algorithm that you gave us, it\u2019s a little tough to get there in the model at first plant? Stefan Larsson : Hey, Michael. So let me start with the question you had for me. Well, both Ralph and the board are committed to continue to execute on the Way Forward Plan, and if you look at the quarter, what Jane went through, we start to see the operating improvements that we are driving through, as a management team, we start to see that come through in the P&L and that\u2019s very exciting to see. When it comes to the different views, it\u2019s - it comes back to being aligned on the love for the brand, being aligned on evolving and then coming to realization that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer facing parts that\u2019s as much as I can share right now. Jane Nielsen : So Michael on your question, since Investor Day, what we've seen is that as we signaled in our FY 2018 guidance, we still have quality in the sales initiatives work to do as we move into FY 2018. And especially in the first half, we expect a sequential recovery in the second half. What\u2019s giving us confidence in operating margin expansion, in a constant currency basis is that we have two strong pistons in the engine, both gross margin expansion and our increased confidence in that. And increased confidence that we can deliver our SG&A savings that we laid out. You'll see that in our results this year and you will see it as we travel through to FY 2018. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. It looks like your America\u2019s wholesale business will end the fiscal year about $2 billion in revenues, so about $500 million decline over the prior year. I was curious to know, what do you think is the right size of that business on a go forward basis? And on the flip side, what are the opportunities to grow your European wholesale business further beyond fiscal 2017? Jane Nielsen : Yes, let me start with your question on North America. As you look at our results in our trends on a year-to-date basis the primary driver of what\u2019s happening in North America is a result of our strategic actions. First, if I just take this quarter, about half of the revenue decline was attributable to our efforts in the Way Forward Plan to really match our inventories to demand in this quarter that was about - that attributed about half of the decline that we saw. The other component, about 30% was a reduction that we took to lower excess inventory, to the value channels and wholesale. So as we said, we think we\u2019re out of balance today and we are aggressively moving to right-size that balance. So that\u2019s a part, as you look at the trend, a great deal of that is attributable to what we\u2019ve decided to do as a part of the Way Forward Plan. When we have a supply chain that is closer to market and closer to demand, when as we continue to improve our ability to buy informed, we believe we can get back to share growth in our wholesale channel, and that would be a propellant to growth for us as we move forward. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane : Thank you for taking my questions. It hasn\u2019t been asked yet but just given that we haven\u2019t spoken to you since the results of the election, I wondered if you could update us on how you\u2019re thinking about the Border Adjustment Tax and any kind of role Ralph Lauren is having in conversations with the government on this potential impact? Jane Nielsen : Sure Kate, let me take that. Obviously let me step back from the question and to say that we are a very proud American company. We are and always will be intrinsically tied to Ralph\u2019s vision of the American dream. We are headquartered in New York City and directly employ over 15,000 Americans. That said, there\u2019s not a lot of clarity right now on the various proposals and specifically the Border Adjustment Proposal and there\u2019s a lot of speculation. We are taking that very seriously and are closely monitoring any decisions made by the new administration. We\u2019re obviously looking across our supply chain and looking for opportunities to mitigate any impact that we might see. As a part of the retail community we\u2019re playing a role in that community to put forth the impact that this kind of action could have. So we are looking to - as we look forward, of course we will comply with any new legislation. This has been our practice and move swiftly to mitigate any of those actions. But right now we\u2019re looking at scenarios and alternatives and waiting to see what legislation will actually be enacted. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. Dave Weiner : Yeah good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on what you saw in terms of tourism here in the U.S. both at your outlets stores and your full price stores. Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Dave, well foreign tourism was still down in this quarter. We are seeing a sequential improvement to what we saw in the first and second quarters of this year. So still pressured in foreign tourism but a significant improvement from what we saw as we exited the second quarter. And certainly the declines are about half of what we saw in the same quarter last year, so overall improvement. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. David Glick : Thank you good morning. Just kind of a leadership and transition question, obviously Jane you\u2019ve led a similar turnaround of Way Forward at Coach, but in terms of the non-financial parts of the business, as Stefan exits, who is going to lead the product, the merchandising, the retail strategies, as you guys move forward and is there a risk of additional departures that - Stefan obviously recruited a lot of very capable executives from outside the company, if there some risk there? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure. So Stefan is going to be fully on Board through May 1st, and we're going to work very closely on the transition. That said, this is - we have a very strong capable team of leaders around the globe. And so it\u2019s with that team that we will be working together to ensure execution of the Way Forward Plan. This is in no way a one person leadership team. It\u2019s a strong leadership team with a strong bench. It might be a little self-serving to say that Stefan's brought in a great bench of new talent, but set that aside, part of building this strong foundation and part of Stefan\u2019s contribution is the great talent that he's brought into the company to blend with an already strong leadership team. And I know that like me many of us joined the company, because we really believe in the brand, the strength of the brand and Ralph\u2019s enduring vision that\u2019s the touchstone of the brand. So we are going to secure execution and move forward as a team. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Great thanks, good morning. I guess Jane for you, just going back to the wholesale channel with the premarket commitment now 15% of the season versus 60%, I mean that suggests a very significant reduction in the order book. So what confidence does the team have there that the retailers will reorder and that the turn within wholesale and inventories aligned can accelerate for that at once business just given some of the structural challenges that we are all facing right now in this industry? Jane Nielsen : Yeah. Erinn, I just want to be very clear. The 15% premarket commitment versus 60% is not a reduction in the order book. It\u2019s actually a timing trend that we, in our past had placed 60% of our orders before we had the orders from our wholesalers. The change is that now only 15% of our orders because of longer lead times have to be placed before we meet with our wholesale partners and receive their feedback and orders. So it\u2019s not an order book reduction. It\u2019s actually moving that commitment date out so that we can be perfectly aligned with our wholesale partners. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Lindsay. Lindsay Drucker Mann : The design function had reported in to Stefan. During this period of transition Ralph as the Chief Creative Officer, will design be reporting directly into him and will he be playing an active day-to-day role, role in managing that part of the business or we still talking about the strong bench that will be addressing design and creative? And as we think about the timeline toward an evolution in the product, we had expected to see some initial changes under Stefan\u2019s leadership this spring, as we think about how that aesthetic might evolve given the difference of opinion, sort of what timeline are we talking about until we get to see the true vision of what Ralph's kind of new product looks like. Stefan Larsson : Well, thank you, Lindsay. Let me start. So when it comes to the transition, I\u2019m staying on for an extended transition period as Jane mentioned. So I\u2019m staying on until May 1st. So no changes within the next three months and what we communicated this morning is that the Board and Ralph has initiated a CEO search. When it comes to the initial product improvements, you will see some improvements this spring and we're just now finalizing the market for full, the wholesale market for full 2017 and we see some great progress there in terms of cutting down productive tail, refocusing on the core, being better at looking at competitive intelligence to strengthen our own offering. So it will be gradual improvements starting spring and going into fall and then onwards from there. Jane Nielsen : Yeah. Lindsay, I just want to add that Ralph is not interested in running the business day-to-day. He does want to play an active role in the creative decisions, including design and consumer facing decisions. In terms of reporting relationships, reporting relationships to Stefan will say the same through May and then well, Ralph and I and Stefan will work on an organization structure that make sense to ensure the execution of the plan. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Robert Drbul : Hi and good morning. A couple of questions on just on the revenue outlook. Jane could you maybe just address the progression of the expectations for the retail comps in FY 2018 and do you have any idea when you would expect revenues to begin to grow again at the business? Jane Nielsen : Yes, so Bob, I think we\u2019ll come back and give more specific guidance as we typically do on the fourth quarter call. What we\u2019re seeing now at this stage of our planning for FY 2018 is we will expect quality of sales initiative in retail and wholesale to continue to pressure revenue and comps through the first half, and then as we move into the second half much of that quality of sales initiatives and distributions will start to abate and you\u2019ll see a sequential improvement in performance. That said, it\u2019s really FY 2019 where we would expect to return to revenue growth. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Jane just two quick ones. You said basically 50 closures for the year and you\u2019ve done 27. So 23 set for Q4. Are there any openings which we modeling in Q4? And then this when you mentioned the margin up next year in constant currency, is that to mean that ex-currency you would expect margins might not be up and I'm just kind of curious at current spot rates what you think the FX impact on your margin would be right now just to help us think about the model? Jane Nielsen : Sure, Ike so in the fourth quarter we have one opening and we\u2019re on track as you mentioned for 50 closures this year. As I look at the model and current pressures right now at current spot rates I'm expecting about 50 to 75 basis points of pressure on operating margin. I think we have to see what happens on currency rates. Overall what I can say is that on constant currency basis that we\u2019ll have operating margin expansion in FY'18. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mathew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Thanks. So as we think about the wholesale reset I guess what assumption have you made for the department store sector looking ahead? Are you anticipating further door closures and just what\u2019s the strategy for the mix of off-price business versus today? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Yes we are anticipating door closures with our retail partners. In fact as of the end of the Q3 we have worked closely and collaboratively with our department store partners and have worked through about 70% alignment on the point of sale closures that we announced last quarter that would reduce our points of distribution in department stores by 20% to 25%. So we are well underway there. We\u2019re obviously working in partnership with them to understand their future door plans. So that we\u2019re fully aligned on that. And that\u2019s incorporated into our overall guidance. So about between door closures and wholesale closures it\u2019s about 200 basis points of pressure. So I feel that we are aligned with our partners and we\u2019re modeling that into our guidance. In terms of the right balance with what I\u2019ll call off-price wholesale, what we know is a touchstone [ph] is that we have to be where the consumer wants to shop. And so they are an important part of our distribution. But what we also know is that we are not in balance where that distribution should be. So what we\u2019ve modeled is continued rebalancing of that channel through the balance of FY 2018 and that will be down significantly double-digits as we move through FY 2018. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Hi, good morning everyone. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Dana. Dana Telsey : As you think about the team, are there other holes in the team that need to be filled and on the speed to market process, where are we and is it getting faster? What should we see in terms of the product assortment, and [indiscernible], should we see in fall or how should we see it coming into fall? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : So, Dana from the team as we've said, we have one significant search out there and it is for a Chief Marketing Officer. We're making progress, but that\u2019s the most significant search that we have right now for the team. Stefan Larsson : Yes, and when it comes, Dana, when it comes to the speed to market, I\u2019m really pleased to add the progress that Halide Alagoz, our Head of Sourcing from H&M and Bill Campbell, who's 11 years from Amazon on the supply chain, how they come together and deliver on our nine months lead times, cutting the lead times from 15 to nine. They\u2019re making great progress and so you should expect that to continue. They\u2019re working in close cooperation with Valerie Hermann and the brand teams as well. So it\u2019s a team work that I\u2019m very excited about, that you can already see in the Q3 performance that is starting to get traction. Evren Kopelman : Okay. We'll take one last question please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole : Great, thanks for taking my question. Jane, my question is, there is clearly been a lot of discussions about how to evolve the creative and consumer facing parts of the business. I mean it sounds like maybe some decisions have been made. Can you just tell us at a high level, what will be different going forward about the creative consumer facing parts of the business? Jane Nielsen : So the pieces that we talked about in the Way Forward Plan remain. We are going to evolve from a classic iconic core and continue to execute 50% new, 50% DNA, classic product, I think it\u2019s the direction of that product that will evolve. And Ralph is going to play an active role in evolving that. You will see our progress in the Way Forward Plan, specifically on product starting in fall of - fall of 2017 and continues through into the spring season. So we are making progress, you will see it evolve and it will continue to evolve from there. It\u2019s been part of our D&A as a company. We've evolved for the past 50 years, and its Ralph\u2019s intention to continue that evolution. Evren Kopelman : Operator? Operator : Yes, as of this time\u2026 Evren Kopelman : We'll close the call. I\u2019ll turn it to Jane to close the call. Jane Nielsen : I want to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to speaking with many of you shortly and through the quarter and we're committed to executing our plans and providing you transparency on our progress and moving forward. Stefan Larsson : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now I will turn the call over to Jane. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Evren, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m looking forward to reviewing our progress for the year in detail, but let me start with one of the most important developments, which I\u2019m sure you all saw yesterday. We have appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrice Louvet.  Patrice is a highly seasoned and successful business leader. He most recently served as the Group President of Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble and has a strong track record of leading global businesses during this 25 year-plus career at P&G. He has a deep understanding of consumers and brands, a collaborative leadership style, and a passion to win in the marketplace. The team is ready to welcome him when he joins in July, and I am looking forward to partnering with him. Now let me turn to a review of our performance and future outlook. 2017 was an important year as we strengthened the foundation of the company. We created operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, increased the productivity of our assortment, and improved quality of sales. Let me take you through some of the key achievements for the year, starting with product. We improved the productivity and profitability level of our assortment by cutting the unproductive styles. For both spring and fall 2017, we reduced the number of SKUs by 20% and focused our investments on our core iconic products. Second, we reduced our lead times. Fifty percent of our business is now on a nine-month lead time, and we are on track to get to 90% by the end of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we are driving improvements beyond the nine-month mark. For spring 2018, approximately 35% of our business will be at lead times of six months or less. Third, we have aligned inventory to demand. Inventory is 30% below prior year with improved turn. This has been achieved through both restructuring actions and a more effective buying process. In addition, since the start of our aggressive inventory management initiatives in Q2 \u201917, we reduced our warehouse space by 13% with continued reductions planned for the first half of FY18. Fourth, our distribution is healthier. We closed 50 underperforming doors in our retail fleet and we are well on track to close 20 to 25% of our U.S. wholesale points of distribution by the second half of FY18. Fifth, our expense structure is more efficient. We reduced SG&A by $240 million in fiscal 2017. Our organization has reduced management layers from nine to six, with a 20% reduction in the executive population over the last two years. Additionally, we consolidated regional operations under a single international group to streamline costs and processes. This group will be led by Howard Smith, who recently served as President of the Asia-Pacific region. Howard has a track record of elevating the brand, driving sales growth, and improving operations during his 15-year career at Ralph Lauren. Lastly, we have recently added two key senior hires - Jonathan Bottomley, Chief Marketing Officer, who joins us from Vice Media, and Tom Mendenhall, Brand President for Menswear, who joins us from Tom Ford International. Jonathan will report to Patrice, our new CEO, and Tom reports to Val\u00e9rie Hermann, our President of Global Brands. Now I\u2019ll turn to a quick review of our fourth quarter financials. This quarter, we continued to deliver against our strategy and commitment. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 16%, in line with guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and on a 13-week to 13-week basis, revenues were down 12% to last year. Adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, 10 basis points above last year and in line with our guidance of 6% to 6.5%. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points excluding the impact of the 53rd week and foreign currency. Adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points driven by improved quality of sales, reduced promotional activity, lower product cost, and favorable geographic and channel mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 90 basis points.  This quarter operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other charges, were down 12% to last year on a like-for-like basis. Expense initiatives drove the decrease. These included streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, changing product development processes to reduce costs, and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet.  The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% on an adjusted basis, lower than our guidance for 30%. This was due to a geographic shift in expense mix driven by changes in our ecommerce platform development. Moving onto a review by geography, as we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we are changing our reportable segments from wholesale, retail and licensing to North America, Europe and Asia, driven by significant organizational and operational changes we\u2019ve implemented over the past 12 months. We will provide segment information under the new reportable segments for the past eight quarters in an 8-K that will be filed later today. We will also continue to give visibility to wholesale and retail sales trends going forward. All our comments today will be consistent with the change in our reportable segments. In North America, revenue was down 21% in the fourth quarter as we executed important quality sales initiatives as a part of our work to come back to high performance. Operating margin was down 200 basis points. In North America wholesale, we continued to strengthen our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and to reduce inventory levels at our wholesale partners, all targeted to improve full price selling. We continued to reduce our sales in the off-price channel as we look to scale back this channel across our geographies.  These deliberate actions - pulling back on excess inventories, lowering sales to the off-price channel, executing door closures and exiting brands, coupled with challenging trends, resulted in wholesale revenue down 23% in the quarter. In our directly operated ecommerce business in North America, we took further actions to harmonize pricing and reduce promotions. Comps were down 20% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower inventory units, reduced SKU count, and fewer promotional periods. While these initiatives created significant pressure on ecommerce revenue, they drove healthy gross margin expansion and importantly created greater price coherence in the region.  These are important first steps; however, more work remains through fiscal 2018 as we aggressively address our high level of promotion in this channel. This is an important component of a multifaceted program to both ensure promotional consistency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in our most important door. Moving on to Europe, revenue was down 3% in constant currency in the fourth quarter primarily due to the 53rd week impact and calendar shifts that negatively impacted retail comps. Operating margin in Europe improved approximately 500 basis points in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. In Asia, revenue was down 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter primarily due to the 53rd week impact and store closures. Operating margin in Asia improved approximately 800 basis points versus prior year in constant currency, excluding restructuring charges. This was driven by an improved gross margin through lower discount rates and expense reduction initiatives. Across our international groups, we have focused throughout the year on improving quality of distribution and quality of sales. The majority of this work is behind us and we have a solid foundation in our international markets. We are also laying important groundwork for growth, including building on our relationships with digital pure play partners like Zozotown in Japan, and Zalando, Asos and mytheresa in Europe. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched an exclusive collection with Zalando with a dedicated marketing campaign and we\u2019ve seen strong sell-through so far. In Asia, we launched with Shinsegae and Hyundai Online in the fourth quarter.  Moving on to comparable store sales, in constant currency and on a like-for-like basis, comps were down 11%. Excluding calendar shifts related to both Christmas and Easter holidays, the underlying comp trend was down 8% in the fourth quarter, similar to the underlying trend of down 7% in the third quarter. Global ecommerce comps declined 16% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, impacted by the previously mentioned initiatives in North America. As these actions continue through fiscal \u201918, we are forecasting mid-teens decline in global ecommerce comps with lower discount rates and higher gross margins.  As you saw in our announcement last month, we are moving to a more flexible platform for our directly operated ecommerce business through a new collaboration with Salesforce Commerce Cloud. This new solution will deliver a more brand enhancing and consistent experience for our consumers with a lower total operating cost than the platform we were internally developing.  In concert with our actions in our directly operated ecommerce business, we continue to evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer and drive growth through our online partners. Last year, global sales of our product across both our pure play and department store customers\u2019 websites were approximately $500 million at retail, comparable to the sales volume of our directly operated ecommerce business. We expect continued growth with our digital partners in FY18. Turning to our store fleet, we achieved our goal and closed 54 underperforming doors in fiscal 2017, ending the year with 466 standalone stores and 619 concessions on a global basis. For fiscal 2018, we plan to open approximately five net new stores and 35 net new concessions driven by growth in Asia.  Moving onto the balance sheet, our progress with our plan is reflected in our inventory position. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory declined 30% to $792 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by both restructuring actions and an improvement in our operating processes, including a proactive pull-back in receipts and moving toward a demand-driven supply chain. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $588 million, down from $713 million last year.  Capital expenditures for fiscal \u201917 were $284 million compared with $418 million in the prior year period. This was lower than guidance of $325 million primarily due to a shift in several retail projects into FY18 and an increased focus on return on investment. The year-over-year reduction is driven by lower IT and infrastructure investment. Regarding share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing full year \u201917 repurchases to $200 million, consistent with our communication in June.  Now let me review our restructuring activities. We are on track with our total savings targets from the initiatives we announced last June related to the Way Forward plan. In addition, we recently announced a new restructuring plan with estimated charges of $370 million throughout fiscal \u201918 and associated savings of approximately $140 million. We\u2019ve made good progress on these actions and are on track to deliver those savings by the end of fiscal \u201919. In the fourth quarter, we recognized $216 million of charges from this new plan. Total charges for the quarter were $370 million, of which about $120 million was cash. Now I\u2019d like to turn to guidance for fiscal \u201918. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. Our work to strengthen the foundation of the business will continue in fiscal 2018 as we set the stage to bring demand back to the business. We expect revenue to decline 8% to 9% for the year excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to have approximately 150 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality of sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year. We expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by 50 to 75 basis points.  Clearly there are many variables in play as we enter FY18. This guidance is grounded in that reality and reflects our decision to accelerate quality of sales initiatives while providing some flexibility to roll out products, marketing, and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be down low double digits, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on currency exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 225 basis points in the first quarter. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be about 9.5% to 10%, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is expected to pressure operating margin by about 75 basis points. Regarding tax rates, as noted in our press release this morning, we are adopting the new accounting standard ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments. This will affect our effective tax rate and increase its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. Based on a stock price of $75 per share, the adoption of this standard is expected to raise the fiscal 2018 tax rate to approximately 28% and the first quarter rate to 33%. Without this impact, the effective tax rate would be approximately 25% for the year. This impact is most significant in the first and second quarters due to the timing of vesting and exercise of certain stock compensation. Let me now review our priorities for cash and capital structure. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. Currently we are planning no share repurchases in fiscal 2018 as we evaluate the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics, and the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform.  We expect capital expenditures for fiscal \u201918 to be $300 million to $320 million, driven by new store openings, renovation of our retail environments, and infrastructure investments.  In closing, we are moving in the right direction. We are creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand and our business in a challenging environment. We remain intensely focused on our execution as we build a pathway to sustainable growth. Ralph, the board and I are thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company, where he joins a passionate, committed team of over 23,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. With that, let\u2019s open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Morning, thanks for taking my question. Jane Nielsen : Sure, good morning, Omar. Omar Saad : Hi Jane. Wanted to see if you guys could talk a little bit more about Patrice\u2019s hiring and the thought process behind it, and maybe dive into a little bit more detail around why he\u2019s the right person for the job. Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Well you know, as you saw in the announcement yesterday, Patrice has a proven track record of leading major global consumer brands, and he\u2019s really an operator who has had a career that\u2019s focused on efficiency and effectiveness in the organization\u2019s he\u2019s run. He has transformed and grown brands like Olay and Pantene with a real focus on leveraging consumer insights. He\u2019s a global citizen and has diverse experience across distribution channels, from ecommerce to wholesalers to retail, so he really has had a breadth of experience. Probably most importantly, he really has a collaborative leadership style, who can work in partnership with Ralph and the senior team to ensure that we can move forward on the front-facing part of our plan to get demand back to our business, so we\u2019re all excited to welcome him.  I think Patrice knows well and appreciates the steps that we\u2019ve taken over the last year as a part of the plan to improve our business, and he\u2019s fully supportive in continuing that work to create an effective business, to continue to focus on our value creating engines and to pivot to the consumer-facing side of our business in partnership with Ralph. Evren Kopelman : Great. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Corinna Van Der Ghinst on for Kate. Hi Jane. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the quality of sales initiatives that you guys have talked about in the past. I know you\u2019ve discussed moving away from a more promotional model. I was just wondering how you see kind of the gross margin expectations for the year and also qualitatively where have some of your bigger challenges been in getting back to that kind of fuller price selling model. Jane Nielsen : Sure. So as I step back and look at FY17, I think one of the things that we are very proud of is the work that we\u2019ve done on quality of sales. It\u2019s shown up in our gross margin every quarter and it\u2019s shown up in our results in FY17. Just looking at this quarter, about half of our sales--I\u2019m sorry, about half of our gross margin improvement was a result of reduced promotions and better sell through on higher margin product. The other half was balanced between favorable geographic and channel mix and better product costs. As we look at our efforts in quality of sales, we\u2019ve been very effective particularly in the second half of the year of really pulling back thoughtfully in partnership with our wholesale partners on receipts to ensure that our plan and our receipt flow was designed to flow in and reflect higher margin sell through. So we purposely planned, pulled back, looked at the percentage of our business that was selling at a discount that we viewed as too heavy, pulled back on those receipts so that we could move in in wholesale into higher margin sell through. That\u2019s starting to happen. It had to be done planfully because of the long lead times on inventory, but you\u2019re starting to see that. Equally, ecommerce, the fourth quarter I think shows our lean into quality of sales in ecommerce. We worked through the inventory that we had ordered almost a year ago, but we really pulled back on promotion frequency and promotion depth on some key icon styles, notably in our women\u2019s and children\u2019s business. You\u2019re going to see that continue as we move forward. We\u2019ve planned our receipts to move into higher margin sell through and to move forward on a reduced promotional cadence. So what we\u2019re starting to see is real harmony across the market, notably in North America, and a real planful pull-back that continues quality of sale. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Rosalie Frazier : Hi, this is Rosalie Frazier on behalf of Lindsay Drucker Mann. We had a question on FX impact to margins. As a follow-up on that, are you taking any pricing to offset FX headwinds? Jane Nielsen : So as we look at FX headwinds, most of our--we think about pricing specifically in-market. Most of our customers internationally are local customers, so we move into currency headwinds by taking pricing largely on innovation and new styles, so we will address some of those headwinds, largely on innovation, and moving into pricing on innovation and on new styles. So it\u2019s not--we don\u2019t move pricing with FX, we do step back in the marketplace in which we operate, we look at the value of our product, we look at the competition in the marketplace, and then we look at some of the macro factors and price accordingly. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : Great, thanks. Good morning. Jane Nielsen : Morning Erinn. Erinn Murphy : Good morning. You talked about sales guidance throughout the year showing some steady improvement. Can you just speak a little bit more about what you see are the drives of that improvement in the back half of your fiscal year, and then just clarifying, Jane, I think you also said in the guide half of the sales declines are from brand and distribution exits. Can you just refresh the thoughts on what percentage was denim and supply off-price pull-back versus wholesale pull-back? Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Let me just--let me step back from the components of your question. As we move through the year, I expect sequential improvement in both our wholesale business as we start to overlap some of the quality of sales initiatives that we started and move into full price selling, so I expect that to improve pretty much sequentially through the year. I do expect the fourth quarter in our businesses, and largely in North America, to be better as we\u2019ll benefit from Easter in the fourth quarter of FY18, and equally expect our retail comps and overall sales to move to be sequentially better as we move through the year. As I mentioned, most of our work in international, we\u2019ve gone through the majority of our work, and I expect international overall to move to--to be moving into positive sales growth territory as we move through to the back of the year. Ecommerce, where we really did the bulk of our work in the fourth quarter and we have a significant amount of quality of sales work left to do in FY18, will be a pressure point as we move through the year. Then just in terms of the comment on denim and supply, we are exiting denim and supply through all four quarters of the year, as we announced. Denim and supply, we did execute spring shipments in FY17, so that pressure will be through the four quarters of the year, and it is about 200 basis points of pressure overall for FY18. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning, and thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the wholesale channel. Jane, last quarter you provided some very helpful metrics to quantify the decline in wholesale revenues, particularly around the Way Forward plan and the reductions in the value channel. Can you provide those metrics for the fourth quarter 15% decline, and then secondly with the new reporting structure, how should we think about the changes year-over-year for North America, Europe and Asia revenues in FY18? Jane Nielsen : Laurent, could you repeat the second part of your question about Europe and Asia? Laurent Vasilescu : Sure, yes. With the new reporting structure, how should we think about those changes year-over-year in revenues for North America, Europe and Asia in FY18? Jane Nielsen : Sure, got it. Thank you. So in terms of our overall wholesale business, what we saw as we moved into the fourth quarter is we continued with about a 20% pull-back in the sales of our off-price channel, and as I mentioned, that is work that we\u2019ll continue to do and will continue throughout FY18. Our objective is to reduce the percentage of sales that off-price wholesale represents to our total wholesale business. Then as I think about the new--as we think about the new reporting segments, Europe and Asia as we move through FY18, Asia in particular should have--will be moving through store closures in the first half, but moving into growth in the second half, and about a similar shape for Europe with more pressure in the first half but moving into growth year-over-year in sales in the second half. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Brian Tunick with RBC. Brian Tunick : Thanks very much, good morning. Jane Nielsen : Morning Brian. Brian Tunick : Morning Jane. Curious on how we should be measuring inventory as we move through the year, particularly in the wholesale channel. Maybe just give us some idea of the metrics we should expect. Obviously inventory is down sharply right now, but how should we be thinking about that the next couple of quarters, and then any update on the number of remodels of shop-in-shops planned for this year inside your wholesale partners? Thanks very much. Jane Nielsen : Certainly. So as you think about inventory as we move through the year, we are continuing our work on overall inventory and you will see inventory in the first half declining about--you know, in the 20% range. As we pivot into inventory orders that are more oriented to FY19 demand, you\u2019ll see inventory down in the low double digits in Q3 and then starting to align with overall sales in Q4. So again, inventory first half in the 20% range, second half should average out to down in the high single digit range. Then in terms of overall shop-in-shop remodels, we\u2019re still working through the plan on remodels. You will see us targeting some high profile, high traffic doors in wholesale for overall remodels, and then in Asia you will see us doing some--and Europe, you will see us doing some of the corner refreshes in our wholesale business. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti : Hey guys, good morning and thanks for taking my questions; and Jane, thanks for all the detail this morning, very helpful. Just two quick ones, and I apologize if I might have missed it, but the guidance for first quarter, I\u2019m just trying to--it seems like you gave a pretty clear picture on the revenues, but it seems like the implied guidance is for the gross margins to be up pretty significantly, and I know there\u2019s some noise from adjustments in the prior year. If you wouldn\u2019t mind helping us just fine tune approximately where you think the gross margin versus the SG&A lands in your guidance; and apologize again if I did miss that. Then secondly, you\u2019ve spoken a little bit about the off-price channel and continuing to pull back on it, but as you kind of just step back and, say, there aren\u2019t many clear channels of transaction growth in the U.S. right now, one of them is obviously the Amazons of the world and maybe the e-tailers, but also off-price is going to continue to be building stores here. I mean, you\u2019ve given us a lot of detail about how you\u2019re pulling back on it because you were over what would be an equilibrium point, but how are you thinking, I guess strategically, about what the right amount of product is to have in that channel going forward versus having too little exposure there to growth that a lot of consumers consider to be a primary channel of retail? I guess that would be my questions, thanks. Jane Nielsen : Yes, let me answer the last part of your question first, and then I\u2019ll give you some clarity on Q1. We do view value wholesale as a channel that is--that serves a segment of consumers, that they\u2019re excited about the treasure hunt aspect of that channel, and we recognize that. We haven\u2019t said we\u2019re exiting that channel but we are rebalancing it, and we\u2019re rebalancing it both in terms of the amount of product that we sell through that channel and the types of product that we sell through that channel, so you will see it decline as a percentage of our total wholesale business throughout FY18. Then moving forward, you\u2019ll see a slightly different mix of product but you\u2019ll still see us serving that consumer base, but on a less penetrated basis. Then your question in terms of overall gross profit, we do expect margin expansion, gross margin expansion in FY18 in the first quarter. We haven\u2019t given specific guidance, but I would expect that the overall margin expansion should be about similar to what you saw as we exited the fourth quarter, similar to slightly better. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. Matthew Boss : Great. So you\u2019re 9% to 10.5% EBIT margin guidance implies contraction at the midpoint, versus I think in the past you talked about constant currency expansion in the forecast. I guess any changes you\u2019re seeing in the apparel backdrop larger picture, and could you just lay out the variables that drive that 150 basis point range just between the top and the bottom of that EBIT margin guide for this year? Jane Nielsen : Absolutely. So as we look--you know, as we look into FY18, there are a lot of factors in play next year. Clearly we\u2019ve got a rapidly changing consumer environment and we have some significant change internally, so we\u2019ve chosen, number one, to continue to work on building the foundation and right-sizing our business to a healthier base, notably in ecommerce. We need to have a coherent price strategy across the region. We can\u2019t be leading pricing down, and so we are leaning into that price coherency in our ecommerce business, notably in North America. With that said, we still have a consumer-facing strategy. This is still evolving, and we\u2019ve left ourselves some flexibility to roll out product, marketing and store concepts notably in the second half, which would imply a wider range of guidance on overall SG&A growth, notably in the second half. Also in the second half, we begin to lap some of the aggressive SG&A cuts that we took in FY17, and that\u2019s part of that variability as you look through the year. So I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got-overall we are leaning in to some of the pull-back in ecommerce. That\u2019s causing some sales volatility relative to our previous guidance, and we are leaving ourselves the flexibility on the SG&A line to plant important investment seeds for growth. Those are the two areas that give us a guidance range for FY18. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow : Hi, good morning. Jane, thanks for the detail. Jane Nielsen : Morning Ike. Ike Boruchow : Just real quick, so the $370 million in charges, just curious how much of that is cash, and then embedded in your fiscal year top line guide, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what\u2019s embedded on comp - I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, and then within that, your digital expectation as well as the store comp expectation. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure, okay. So why don\u2019t I start with our expectations in terms of guidance. We expect mid to high single digit global retail sales and comp decline. We expect wholesale to decline in the mid teens globally, and we expect ecomm comps to decline in the mid teens globally. Evren Kopelman : Cash? Jane Nielsen : Oh sorry, yes. In restructuring, of the $370 million of Q4 restructuring charges, approximately $120 million was cash. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole : Great, thank you. Jane, you talked about why Patrice is the right person for the job. Can you just talk about how the decision making process will take place as a company going forward between Mr. Lauren, Patrice and yourself? Jane Nielsen : Sure. So first of all, I\u2019d step back and say that we have a very capable and seasoned senior team, so it\u2019s not just Ralph, Patrice and I, it\u2019s an operating committee of seasoned executives that we all play a role from the regions to the functions, and we have operating committee meetings weekly where we address the performance of the business and develop strategy. We also work in--Patrice will work closely, as will the operating team, in concert with Ralph as we put in place the strategy for the consumer-facing part of our transformation, and that would be specific to marketing, to products, and to store design. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen and Company. John Kernan : Good morning Jane, Evren. Thanks for taking my questions. Jane, you talked a lot about efforts with some of the pure plays internationally - Zalando, Asos. Just wondering what your strategy is with Amazon? The brand\u2019s distributed fairly heavily through third party distributors right now on Amazon, just wondering if there\u2019s an opportunity to take it more direct. Then my follow-up question is there\u2019s obviously a lot of pressure on all the global apparel brands from a margin perspective. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re still comfortable with the long term mid teens operating margin target for the company. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yes, let me start with the last part of your question. Clearly improving operating margin and getting to a mid teens operating margin is still our goal, and we are working tirelessly on that Given the change that we have in the environment and the changes that are occurring internally, the big question for us is timing. I think it\u2019s the question for everyone. But certainly getting back to higher operating margin and doing that as quickly as possible is Patrice\u2019s goal, it\u2019s my goal, and it\u2019s the goal of the company, so we\u2019ll give you more visibility and timing as we move through and as we look through these initiatives and see their performance. Then the first part of your question in terms of Amazon and other pure players, this is a dynamic marketplace. The consumer is changing, the digital ecosystem is changing, and as you\u2019ve seen with our efforts that have been very successful on sites like Zalando, we\u2019re looking at all opportunities and that will be a big part of what Patrice will do when he comes in, in concert with the senior team. So we\u2019re open, we\u2019re looking, but these are big strategic issues and we\u2019ll want to do them in partnership with our new chief executive officer. So with that, I want to thank you for joining our call today. I look forward to speaking with many of you later on today and throughout this quarter, and I especially look forward to talking with you next quarter when Patrice will join me on this call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Evren, Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. It's great to be at the company and partner with Ralph and the entire team. The last few weeks have been exciting for me as I spent time in the marketplace and had the chance to meet with many of our team members as well as our consumers, wholesale partners and key industry opinion leaders. What is clear to me is that we have an iconic brand, a passionate team and a lot of opportunity ahead. Seizing our opportunity requires us to evolve how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. It's something Ralph and I are deeply committed to. As you can see in this quarter's results, we're making good progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth. The team continues to deliver on our commitments to improve quality of sales and distribution, with increased efficiency. On my first call with you, I thought it would be valuable to share what motivated me to join the company, my observations to-date and our areas of focus to get back to growth and value creation. Then, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk through the details of the quarter and our guidance. At the end, we'll take your questions together. To start, I've long admired Ralph and I am honored to partner with him. We are both committed to preserving the essence of our brand, while actively evolving it to renew long-term growth, profitability and returns. To achieve that, Ralph and I are clear on how we will partner together. Ralph is the Chief Creative Officer in charge of the creative brand aesthetic decisions. As CEO, I will lead the company's strategy, execution and business results. Ralph has already been a great partner, and I could not be more enthusiastic about our collaboration. I appreciate the confidence and latitude he has given me in leading this company forward. During this time of transformation for our industry and our business, I am confident we will accomplish a great deal together. Our opportunity is to take an iconic brand and advance it in ways that drive new growth and value in an industry that is undergoing unprecedented change. Our experiences and expertise will be a powerful and winning combination. People who know me well describe me as a builder of both brands and teams. Building up people and teams to accomplish amazing things motivates me. I believe this is one reason Ralph and I click. He was looking for somebody to come in, understand what makes this place so unique and special, and build boldly from that point. I am also committed to objectively evaluating the business and identifying both the strengths on which we can build and the areas that need focused attention and improvement. I am passionate about building brands that consumers love. To do that, we must understand the target consumer, his or her interests and motivations, clearly define what the brand stands for in today's world and then, most importantly, connect the two in a way in which the brand becomes irresistible. To say the retail industry is at an inflection point would be an understatement. Technology has transformed the way consumers shop and connect with retail brands. Retail store closures are near a 20-year high as the fundamental shift to e-commerce continues. To stand out and compete in this environment, consumers expect an omnichannel shopping experience that's unlike anything they've seen before. While not easy, I see it as our job to redefine the shopping experience of the future. All these changes are creating challenges, but they're also creating opportunity. The Ralph Lauren brand was built on a belief that we all dream of living a fulfilling life, a life that makes you feel good. I think that is a universally-aspirational ideal. It's an idea that transcends boundaries and generations. And it's as relevant today as it has ever been. Our role is to make it feel vivid and exciting today for consumers everywhere, from Boston to Barcelona to Beijing. We are starting with a great foundation. Our brand is iconic and the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. I am focused on continuing to execute on the operational improvements that were part of the Way Forward Plan, and the team is making good progress in driving efficiencies and improving the quality of our sales by reducing excess discounts, excess inventory, supply chain lead times, unproductive distribution in SKUs, as well as aligning our creative more closely with the consumer. Further, I've been incredibly impressed by the caliber and dedication of the people here at Ralph Lauren. We have a team of talented and hardworking employees who are eager to get back to winning. And with their enthusiastic support, we will push ahead to create more value for our shareholders. It is too early to talk about the evolution of our strategy; however, as I start to work with the team, we have a strong focus on growth that creates value. We are focused on exploring our opportunities in becoming more digital and more global, as well as how we evolve and elevate the offerings and experiences we provide to consumers in order to drive growth. It is important to note that we will balance driving growth with improving efficiencies. We aim to increase our productivity by continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide so we can invest in growth. With the consumer as our touchstone, we're also going to focus on how we work as an organization, so our employees are more empowered, more connected and more energized. Getting culture right is critical for us. In closing, as I shared earlier, we are eager to evolve how the brand is experienced and expressed to win the hearts and minds of consumers globally. While our transformation is in its early days, we are progressively strengthening our position to create new value and renew long-term growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to walk you through the details of the quarter and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Thank you, Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that our entire team is thrilled to welcome Patrice to the company. He joins at a critical moment when we are executing on initiatives to strengthen the foundation of our business that will allow us to position for future growth. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong and continued progress we are making in this area. As you know, last year, we started the important work of enhancing our operational efficiencies by improving our cost structure, evolving towards a demand-driven sell-through culture and improving our quality of sales and distribution. As we started this fiscal year, we are encouraged by the progress in the first quarter and are confident that our efforts are the right ones to lay the groundwork for our future growth initiatives. Let me take you through the key strategic and financial highlights of the first quarter. This quarter, we continued to deliver against our strategy to drive quality of sales and elevate our brand. Key areas of operational focus were : aligning receipts to underlying demand; reducing promotion frequency and depth; optimizing our distribution; and improving our inventory position with increased productivity. Our financial results were consistent with this focused execution. As you saw in our press release, revenues declined 13%, in line with guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 10.2%, 200 basis points above last year and above our guidance of 9.5% to 10% in constant currency. Gross margin also reflected this work and was up 210 basis points to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the gross margin was 260 basis points better than last year. Importantly, we are delivering both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Across our global retail network, discount rates were down and AUR was up almost 4%. Gross margin also benefited from favorable geographic and channel mix, as our high gross margin international and retail businesses represented a large percentage of sales compared to last year. We expect these factors to drive gross margin expansion for the remainder of the year. This work has come in conjunction with continued progress on rightsizing our cost structure. Operating expenses were down 13% to last year in the first quarter. This was driven by : one, streamlining the organization to reduce head count; two, closing unprofitable stores; and three, changing product development processes through SKU optimization. We are on track with our expense savings targets for the year, and this will allow us to invest some of the savings into product, marketing and distribution renovations to drive future sales growth and improve the customer experience. Our current and upcoming product marketing initiatives highlight our iconic core products, emphasize the core values of the brand, while adding interest and newness. As an example, last month, we launched our new limited-edition Polo shirt collection. We are releasing a new shirt every month through November; each inspired by one of our signature design motifs. The launch is supported by social media as we collaborate with influencers on Instagram. Our goal for this program is to position our Polo shirt as an item to covet, reach a new consumer and garner fashion editorial coverage of our icon. We also recently introduced our new fragrance, Ralph Lauren Woman. The face of this new fragrance is two-time Oscar-nominated actress, Jessica Chastain. Digital and social media support for the launch started in July and the product is available this month. In September, we will launch our new global family marketing campaign with strong outdoor and digital components. This, too, highlights Ralph Lauren's core values that our brand is built on. Moving on to our segment highlights, as you know, we are now reporting under our new segments, North America, Europe and Asia. This offers increased visibility into our sales and profitability by region and increased transparency into the development of our business and the progress of our initiatives around the globe. In North America, we continued to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 17% in the first quarter and reflected important progress across our quality of sales initiatives. As a result, we expanded gross margin and prudently reduced expenses, delivering 110 basis points of expansion in adjusted operating margin. In North America wholesale, we continued our work to right-size our business for the long-term health of the brand. We strategically reduced shipments to better align with underlying demand, exited brands, lowered our sales to the off-price channel and closed underperforming doors. We are on track to close 20% to 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution by the second half of FY 2018. We are about halfway through these closures as of the end of the first quarter. These deliberate actions accounted for almost 20 points of the 27% decline in U.S. wholesale in the quarter. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained a challenge as well. To address this and improve the positioning of our brand, we are investing in refreshing our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience and we are evolving our product and marketing to turn around this trend. The sweet spot of U.S. wholesale is their growing digital business. Our retail sales on our U. S. department store customers' websites continue to post positive growth versus last year and as a percentage of our total department store business. We will continue to drive growth through our online partners in FY 2018 and evolve our digital strategy to move with the consumer where, how and when they choose to shop. Moving on to our directly-operated e-commerce business in North America, we are aggressively addressing our high level of promotion activity to both ensure price coherency across our channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience in this, our most important door. These actions in North America drove strong gross margin expansion of 220 basis points to last year; however, they put significant pressure on revenue. North America e-commerce comps were down 22% in the first quarter, reflecting lower levels of promotion activity. To improve the consumer experience online and move beyond promotion-led sales, one of our key digital initiatives is the transition of our platform to a cloud-based solution. With our new consumer interface, we will continue to directly operate and fulfill our e-commerce business with reduced transaction friction for our consumers, improved ability to execute dynamic changes and enhanced omnichannel capabilities. We are on track to launch by the second half of fiscal 2018. This solution will deliver a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for customers and provide a more flexible and nimble solution for us. Moving on to our international regions, in Europe, in constant currency, revenue was down 10% in the first quarter; however, adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points. Wholesale revenue in Europe was down 28% in the first quarter. About half of this decline was due to a shift in timing of shipments to bring delivery closer to demand. Brand exits and reduced off-price sales accounted for the remainder of the decline. Excluding these factors, the underlying trend of the Europe wholesale business is flattish. In Europe, retail sales were flat to last year in constant currency, with comps down 8% as we continued our work with quality of sales initiatives. While this ongoing work impacted comp growth negatively in the first quarter, it drove an 8% increase in AUR, 500 basis point decline in discount rate and 500 basis points of gross margin improvement across our retail network. This contributed to the improvement in operating margin for Europe. And we will continue this strategy for the remainder of the year. In Asia, in constant currency, revenue was up 1% in the first quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 610 basis points. As we mentioned on previous calls, we have been focused on improving quality of sales in Asia over the past 12 to 18 months. We are beginning to see comp stabilize in the region. And in the first quarter, they were up 2% in constant currency, driven by increased traffic. Quality of sales metrics continued to be strong as well. Average unit retails were up. Discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly in Asia. We expect continued comp growth as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand, specifically by increasing engagement with celebrities and influencers in Asia. Turning to our store fleet, we continued to improve our retail network in the first quarter through closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. We opened six and closed five standalone stores. And in concessions, we opened nine and closed four doors, ending the quarter with 467 standalone stores and 624 concessions on a global basis. At year-end, we expect our standalone network of doors to be about flat to last year and have a net increase of 35 to 40 concessions, primarily in Asia. Moving on to the balance sheet, our progress with our plan is reflected in our strengthened inventory and cash positions. At the end of the first quarter, inventory declined 31% to $860 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior-year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand. We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and short and long-term investments, up from $1.2 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $590 million. Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the second quarter of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2018. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline, with quality of sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder. We expect the sales trend to improve as we move through the year. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2018. This is more favorable than our previous guidance of 150 basis points of negative impact. As you know, over the last several months, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. While clearly volatile, we are now assuming a euro, U.S. dollar exchange rate to be 1.14 versus our previous assumption of 1.06. The change in our euro, U.S. dollar exchange rate assumptions is much more impactful on our sales growth than on our gross and operating margins. This is a result of our approach to hedging. We hedge our transaction risk, but not our translation risk. Our hedging programs for our inventory purchases enables us to have less volatility for our margin from exchange rate movements. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9% to 10.5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to pressure operating margin for fiscal 2018 by approximately 40 to 50 basis points, less than the 50 to 75 basis points we guided to in May. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be down 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Based on current exchange rates, the foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about 40 basis points in the second quarter. Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by approximately 40 basis points. As we move through FY 2018, we expect SG&A declines to moderate as we begin to lap last year's reductions and start to invest in growth initiatives around products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for returns. We believe this is the right decision for the long-term, as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting up the company to return to growth. In addition, our SG&A rate is affected by sales mix shifts. Similar to gross margin, as retail becomes a larger percentage of our mix, it pressures our SG&A rate because retail has a much higher SG&A rate than wholesale. As a reminder, we record all our store occupancy and payroll expenses in our SG&A line. It is also worth noting that FX is becoming less of a tailwind and, in fact, is turning into a headwind for SG&A. In terms of restructuring and other charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. We recognized $47 million of the charges in the first quarter. Regarding tax rates, as a reminder, the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments, affects our effective tax rate and increases its variability, with one of the key variables being the price of our stock. Our tax rate guidance assumes a stock price of $78 per share for the remainder of the year. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be approximately 24% to 25% and for the second quarter to be approximately 24%, including ASU [2016-09]. The guidance for fiscal 2018 tax rate is lower than previously forecasted. This is due to recent favorable movements in foreign exchange rates, as we now expect to generate a larger portion of our earnings from jurisdictions where our earnings are taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. In addition, there were some modest favorable adjustments to our tax reserves that resulted in a net benefit to full-year forecasted effective tax rate. Let's me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders, with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be approximately $300 million, driven by select new store openings, renovation of our retail environments and infrastructure investment. In closing, we are moving in the right direction. And I am incredibly proud of our team of 23,000 committed, passionate and dedicated Ralph Lauren employees around the globe. Together, we are committed to creating a strong foundation to evolve this iconic brand, consistent with Ralph's enduring vision. With Patrice's leadership, we will continue to intensely focus on execution as we, together, create a pathway toward sustainable growth. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : The first question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, Jane, and welcome, Patrice. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Morning. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Patrice, so you're inheriting the company's Way Forward Plan. I guess my question is, will you continue to implement the plan as it currently stands or maybe after taking a hard look at it, do you see any opportunities to tweak the original strategy in any way? Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Good morning, Ike, great question. Listen, I think the Way Forward Plan is an operationally sound way to run the business. So, we remain fully committed to it and trust that we're not going to miss a beat when it comes to executing both the operations and the efficiency interventions that we've called out. I'm actually very proud of the team's progress with setting a strong foundation for future growth, whether that's the work on improving the quality of sales or distribution, whether that's the reduction in excess inventory and SKUs and also the progress that you've seen on efficiencies. Now, we also know that if we look at the future, we're going to have the balance progress on productivity with revenue growth. And so moving forward, while we'll continue to drive the operational and efficiency elements of the Way Forward Plan, we're going to put more emphasis on the revenue growth dimension of our program moving forward. And specifically here, I'd call out a few things. One is we're exploring our opportunities to become more digital. We're also looking at our opportunities to be more global, because this brand obviously has incredible relevance around the world. And then Ralph and I are very committed to make sure that we evolve how this iconic brand is expressed, how it's experienced to really win the hearts and minds of consumers around the world. So that's kind of the focus on the growth pieces, early thoughts. We will obviously continue to drive productivity, and the focus here will be on continuing to simplify and streamline our operations company-wide. And then, the focus on how we work is also important to me and to Ralph and to us as leaders of this company. So you'll also see us put more emphasis on new ways of working. Initial thoughts are going to be around making sure our teams are more connected, our teams feel more empowered and, ultimately, we increase the level of energy that we have across all 23,000 employees of the company. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay, next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. You may ask your question. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter and nice to hear your voice on the first call, Patrice. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Hi, Michael. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Let me just ask, I guess, two questions. First on the guidance for the year, Jane, it looks like with the second quarter, the EBIT margins are going to be up about 80 to 100 [basis points], if we ignore currency. But then, if we just back out the second half from the year, it looks like the guidance [ph] is for the (33:15) margins be down quite significantly in the back half. I know you said the year-over-year SG&A improvement will moderate through the year. Maybe just a little bit more on are you leaving room in the back half due to some kind of uncertainties on the top-line or is it truly that we expect to accelerate the investments for growth? And then, secondly, you guys talked a lot about how you're thinking about the net revenue outlook for the year and moving towards quality of sale initiatives, reducing levels of discounting, but I think most people are wondering when you think at this point revenues could return to growth. Are you seeing anything in your conversations as you start to look out into the spring and fall of next year where you're starting to get some traction with product where you could say to yourself, look, there's a point on the horizon where we think all this work we're doing is out of the way and we could return to revenue growth? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Well, certainly, I'll try to unpack your question, Michael. Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you, Jane. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: But certainly, as I look near-in for the balance of this year, as I said, we're very comfortable with our guidance. As we look at the top-line, there's no change to the top-line. We do see gross margin as we move through the second half of the year that will have at least 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. Now, with the guidance that we've given in terms of what SG&A will be down in the second quarter, we see operating margin expansion coming out of that. As we move into the second half, we'll have that continued 100 basis points of gross margin, but we expect that our SG&A will be flattish. And with that, that brings us to our overall guidance that you will see some compression on a constant currency basis in operating margin. As we look longer-term, I think you've heard Patrice very, very clearly and passionately state, we are looking to balance efficiency with getting back to growth, but it has to be sustainable, profitable growth. And, at this time, we're not ready to call the inflection point precisely. That is the question. We do think that we're building a plan that will return us to growth, and we'll come back and give you more specifics on the timing as we move forward. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay, next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Thanks, good morning. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Morning. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Good morning. I wanted to ask you about social media. I think, Jane, maybe you mentioned it in one of your prepared remarks and I'd love to get Patrice's views on the topic as well. It seems like it's a growing channel for connecting with consumers and a marketing channel, if you will. How are you guys thinking about it and other digital marketing activities? And, Jane, I also think I heard you mention, I don't know if it was accelerating growth or strong growth from the digital platforms of some of your wholesale partners. I thought that was an interesting comment, given the just general challenges of the wholesale channel. Thanks. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So, Omar, nice to meet you on the phone. Let me maybe just step back on how we look at e-commerce and online brand-building and, hopefully, that will address both of your questions. So first of all, the way we look at the e-commerce opportunity is really through three lenses. The first one is our own site, and I'll come back to that in a second. The second one is our retailers' sites. And then, the third one are the pure plays. So if you look at the plan on our own site, I think this has been talked in the past, but we're in the process of completely transforming our RalphLauren.com site. And we expect by the end of the fiscal year to have something that we're excited about, both in terms of brand-building and in terms of e-commerce, right. The expectation really for the team is this site needs to be our flagship. It's the kind of flagship store of the future, and it hasn't been that in the past. So there's an important pivot there. And then, obviously, we need it to be an e-commerce machine. As far as our retailers' .com operations are concerned, I've had the chance with my first couple of weeks on the business to actually meet with the CEOs of a number of our top retail partners. And it's actually been exciting to see the focus they're putting on e-commerce and some of the numbers some of them are posting, right, which is actually quite strong. So we want to make sure we're taking advantage of that momentum and working very closely with our retail partners on the way the brand shows up, both again from the brand-building standpoint, our storytelling and from a e-commerce standpoint. Then the third area is pure plays, which is obviously growing significantly. And we're starting to participate in that. We just signed with zulily a few weeks ago. And you can expect us to expand our presence among the pure players, both here in North America and around the world. And then we double-click on social media. You heard in our remarks that Ralph and I are really committed to evolving how the brand is expressed and experienced. And, obviously, social media, Omar, you're absolutely right, has got to be a key part of that. We have a new CMO, a new global CMO that came in a few months ago, who's dead-focused on understanding the landscape, getting super clear on which consumers we really go want to after and then leveraging all the social media platforms that you can think of, both here and around the world, because this is how we will further modernize the brand and really make it even more relevant to the younger populations coming into the market. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yeah, Omar, I just thought I'd give you some dimension on what we see across our wholesale e-commerce business, both department stores and pure plays, that it's about $0.5 billion business for us at retail value globally, about 10% of our total wholesale business in FY 2017. That's an important part of our digital ecosphere, if you will, and it's growing in the first quarter and has been growing, so very positive trend there. As we look at our own e-commerce site, I think we've been really clear about two things. One is job one this entire year is reducing the promotions on the site. You're going to see that. You saw that in the first quarter. You'll see that through the year in terms of the pressure that will have on sales growth. It's critical to deliver price coherency in the market. It's critical from a pricing architecture standpoint, so we're committed to doing that through the year. The growth is going to come as we launch, as we move out of this fiscal year and into the next year and we right-size that pricing architecture and that promotion base. And that will be enhanced by our new e-commerce platform, where we're going to have a better consumer experience and better digital assets and storytelling on the site. And you'll see that as we move through the second half of the year. So I think we are very excited about this space. We are putting resources on it for both our wholesale partners and for ourselves. But it's really going to be FY 2019 when you'll start to see that show up in the top-line numbers. You will see it show up in improved margins, as you're seeing. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay, next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. You may ask your question. Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi, good morning, everyone, and welcome, Patrice. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Dana. Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : As you think about the business and as you evaluated it, how do you view the channels of distribution for the business over time? And how should they look maybe different or evolve from where they are today? And, Jane, the gross margin improvement opportunity going forward, how do you see that evolving, whether it's lead times, speed to market and e-commerce? Thank you. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So very nice to meet you, Dana. First, I would say, we're going to follow the consumer, right? We're going to be driven by where the consumer wants to shop and we will be wherever it makes sense for the brand to show up and where the consumer wants to experience it. So we have an omnichannel play, which we're going to continue to drive. And I expect all these channels will continue to play an important role moving forward, whether that's department stores. Yes, they're under pressure right now, but there's a lot of work going on to also improve the experience that consumers have there. So obviously, that continues to be an important channel for us. Our own stores, whether it's our factory stores or our full-price stores and then, obviously, e-commerce, as we were just talking in the context of Omar's question. And then, there is a role for off-price to play within our overall strategy. So I expect this to continue to drive across these channels. Obviously, the relative size of them and growth rates will vary over time and will vary by country and by region. But we're committed to making sure that we are set up to win, where the consumer wants to shop consistently moving forward. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Dana, as I look at gross margin, that dynamic that Patrice just described, which is really that you're going to see digital be a long-term driver of growth as well as direct-to-consumer overall. And so that will play positively into what you'll see in terms of long-term gross margin expansion. Also, the international opportunity is a tailwind long-term to gross margin expansion. I expect those to be both durable and long-term. They'll play into our gross margin expansion this year and also into the long-term. What's also playing into gross margin, as we talked about the at least 100 basis points of expansion as we look at balance of year, is our AUR improvements and promotion reduction in terms of depth and frequency, and that's also a tailwind through this year of gross margin expansion. As we, long-term, pursue our strategy and execute the strategy to elevate the brand, I do see AUR also as a long-term driver to gross margin expansion. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions. Patrice, you talked about in your opening remarks a need and a desire to redefining the shopping experience for consumers. Can you give us a little more detail on what that means to you? What is a redefined shopping experience in all the key channels you talk about doing business? And then, secondly, for Jane, you talked about in your prepared remarks also that excluding certain actions in Europe, shipment timing, et cetera, European, I think you said wholesale sales, were roughly flattish. Do you have that detail for North America? In other words, excluding some of your inventory actions, et cetera, what is the trend for wholesale, for sales at retail at your wholesale partners? Thank you. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Good morning, Lindsay. So I'll probably be in a better position to answer your question a few months from now. But the way I'm thinking about it with the team is how do we further engage the consumer in our brand, really find a way to tell our story, going well beyond just selling items, but really telling our story and portraying the world that we offer and then closing the sale, all right, closing the sale and driving loyalty. So all these are that's the general conceptual direction, I'd reserve the right to get back to you in our next call with more granularity as we work through the plans with the team. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So, Lindsay, just to parse your question now, in Europe, as we looked at the shipment timing, that accounted for about half of the decline in the wholesale sales this quarter. The other half was really brand exits and reduced off-price. And that, if we exclude that, that's how we get to be about flattish wholesale trend in wholesale, and really what we expect to see roughly as we move through the year. And as I look at North America, and we step back from overall wholesale, so we declined 27 points in the quarter. About 20 was really attributable to what I would say is brand exits, a pullback in receipts and door closures. Those three factors were about 20 points of the decline. So if you look at that over time, we're looking at wholesale underlying trends at about down mid to high single digits. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. You may ask your question. Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. And welcome, Patrice. It's nice to see continued progress around the gross margin, but I wanted to ask about the SG&A margins. First, near-term, can you possibly quantify in dollar terms the key buckets which drove the 13% decline in this quarter? And secondly, longer-term, where do you think SG&A margins can go? As you invest in marketing and product creation, are there any SG&A buckets where synergies can be gained in order to offset these investments? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Sure. So as I think about, in the first quarter, where did the benefit come, it really is in terms of we saw a significant reduction in payroll, reduction in occupancy expenses associated with the store closures that we completed, a reduction in depreciation and then some trimming of what you'd expect, consulting expenses, T&E, rounded out the reductions. But if I had to prioritize them, it would be in that sort of ingredient label order. As we look at longer-term efficiencies, what I think is clear is that we're committed to elevating this brand. And that implies that as we get back to growth, that marketing will grow hand-in-hand with growth. But we do believe there are opportunities for streamlining and efficiencies through our operating processes, through production processes, through streamlined and better leverage of our distribution facilities. And, of course, the ultimate lever is comp growth, which will leverage our fixed costs infrastructure. But that's where I see the longer-term opportunity. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. You may ask your question. Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC : Thanks, good morning. Congrats on the progress. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you. Simeon Avram Siegel - Instinet LLC : So, Patrice, your comments on the growing digital in the pure plays, Amazon, obviously, comes up in just a few conversations. Can you share your view there? And then, congrats on the strong gross margin. Could you just quantify what mix shifts were and then what you'd expect them to be for the rest of the year? Thanks. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Good morning, Simeon. So, yes, obviously, I know Amazon is top-of-mind for all of you and it is for all of us, obviously, as well. So going back to our strategy, we are looking at these three buckets : Our own site, our wholesale .com and pure plays. Within pure plays, we're actually doing a very thorough exercise, as we speak, both for North American and around the globe to understand where we need to show up, where is the consumer shopping, what's the better fit for our brand. And so nothing to announce at this point, but know that we're actively working through what are the right pure play partnerships for this business moving forward. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes, and just as I look at drivers of gross margin expansion in the quarter, about half of it was channel and geographic mix. And the other half was really driven by what I will call pricing and promotion reductions and AUR improvements. And those dynamics, I expect them to continue through the year with about that level of contribution. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks, good morning and welcome, Patrice. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Erinn. Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I guess, Patrice, I had a question for you. I know you've been there just a few months. But when you take a step back and just think about the prognosis of the Ralph Lauren brand, how do you think about it as it relates to today's millennials and keeping the brand relevant? It just seems like that's a cohort of consumers that's been a little bit harder to reach in the last few years. And then, Jane, just for you, in North America, as it relates to international tourist flows, what did you see during the first quarter? Thanks. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Good morning, Erinn, a very good question on the millennial consumer. Well, I kind of step back, and Ralph and I have actually had a number of conversations on this that says, okay, what are the core values of the Ralph Lauren brand, all right. And we would say they're entrepreneurship, creativity, stylish living and authenticity, and all that is coupled with a very rich heritage of real storytelling. All of that is timeless, right, if you think through the values that are relevant to today's consumer, millennials would raise their hand and say that makes lot of sense to them. The second thing I would say is as we look at the millennial consumer, is that they are looking for meaning in brands. Again, they are not just buying a product. They're buying into a world. They're buying into a set of values. And they place a lot of emphasis on where do you come from, what do you stand for, what's your story, what are your values, are you giving back to the world. I think, again, the Ralph Lauren brand is incredibly well-positioned on this whole meaning space. So the challenge for us is, okay, with these strong value foundations, with this sense of meaning, how do we translate it today for that consumer group, right? And that's the work Ralph and I and the team are committed to. That's why we talk about evolving and elevating the way the brand is expressed and experienced, because we know we are going to have to make some changes in terms of how we engage the consumer, where we engage the consumer. Go back to the earlier conversation we're having on social media, back to the earlier discussion we're having on driving digital harder because we know a number of the millennial consumers are not interested in going into brick-and-mortar. But I feel very confident coming in with the foundations of this brand. And now the challenge and the task for us, and I'm very confident we can do this well, is to translate it in a way that connects with today's consumers and the millennial population coming up. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And, Erinn, just in terms of the foreign tourist trends that we're seeing, as we normalize for some of the calendar pushes and pulls as we move through 2017, really, 2017 foreign tourist traffic, we saw down about 15%. And we're seeing some positive signs. Foreign tourist traffic is still down in the first quarter, but really in the high single-digit range. So again, some improvement as you normalize out of last year and adjust for some of the calendar shifts from down 15% to down high single-digit. Evren Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay, we'll take one last question. Operator : The last question comes from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Jane, could you provide an update on the design cycles and how you're feeling about the progress on speeding design cycles in speed to market? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: We feel great. We are on track to deliver what we said, which was 90% of our product in a nine month timeframe. And additionally, we are looking to have 35% of our product now on a six month timeframe. So we're very encouraged by the work that we're doing. We know it gives us greater ability to read the market and react to the market and manage our inventory flows productively, so very encouraged with that. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And I would second that. And I think as I've engaged with the teams, we have real energy to continuously raise the bar. So, as Jane's mentioned, we're making great progress against the original targets that we had set for ourselves. We're not going to stop there, all right. We're going to continue to raise the bar till ultimately we get into a best-in-class position across the board for lead times. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Good. Well, listen, this closes out our call. Thank you for joining us, and then we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thanks. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Abrein. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute on our plan to drive efficiencies and set a strong foundation for future growth. While we're certainly not where we want to be yet, we are encouraged that second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance and we outperformed on operating margin, as our quality-of-sales initiatives over delivered our expectations. This focus will continue through the rest of the year, and we are on track to deliver our full year targets. Over the past several months, I've met with many of our key suppliers and customers and thousands of our employees all over the world, these interactions have reaffirmed my excitement about the opportunity for our brand globally, I am incredibly inspired by the passion and commitment of our teams and confident in their capabilities. I've also spent a lot of time with Ralph, and we have developed a very close and productive partnership. I'm particularly excited by some of the early progress we're making together to drive the business forward. Moving ahead, we are focused on reigniting quality growth, while continuing to drive productivity. This balance of growth and productivity will translate into value creation for all of our stakeholders. Our key initiatives include : First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution. Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Third, expanding our digital and international presence, and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. While there's still a lot of work to be done, I'd like to take you through some of the early signs of progress across each of these initiatives. First, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution. In the second quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail, which was up 5% across the company's direct-to-consumer network. Gross margin was up 300 basis points to last year. We continue to close unproductive distribution in retail and wholesale and significantly reduced off-price shipments. Second, evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within product, we are driving a much more disciplined assortment, focusing on our icons, renewing our core items to make them relevant to today's consumer and developing limited editions to inject energy and excitement into our brand. The result of this work is most evident in the improving sellout trend we're seeing in Polo with fall seasonal product. While it is still early in the season, we are seeing increased full price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year in both men's and women's apparel. Within Polo Fall seasonal products, some of the bestsellers are our icons and updated core items, including the varsity jacket, the American flag in polar bear sweaters, the denim trucker jacket, embellished military-inspired styles and novelty mist [ph] with color blocking. These renewed icons are especially resonating with millennials. We're also seeing success in the denim category with updated fits, washes, lighter weights and incorporating stretch into the majority of the overall offering. In addition, we're beginning to offer limited-edition products on a regular basis to create more reasons for consumers to engage with us. These launches are integrated across product, digital media and our sales channels to create a consistent experience for the consumer. As part of this, we launched the Stadium collection in September. The original Stadium collection was introduced to celebrate the 1992 Summer Olympics, and many pieces became iconic collector's items. We released both replicas and modern interpretations at select Ralph Lauren and third-party stores around the world. We sold out several million dollars' worth within hours. Importantly, 78% of the people who purchased Stadium at a Ralph Lauren store in North America were new consumers to the brand. Another example of limited-edition is our monthly Polo shirt launches, including the collegiate, Eldridge and torn jacket. Each has achieved strong full price sell-through worldwide. We will continue limited-edition series in the future. In marketing, we are leveraging new channels and partnerships, especially in digital and social media that will help the brand reach and acquire new consumers. For example, I'm sure many of you saw our terrific show in September where Ralph and the team created a truly unique experience in its garage in Bedford. We leverage our fashion show as a media event with a specific focus on Instagram, Facebook, Tmall, WeChat, Youku and RalphLauren.com. The show generated over a billion social media impressions, more than double our February show through an expanded list of global social live stream hosts and 24 hours of Instagram stories. We also had many celebrity dressing moments that increased our social media impact, including Blake Lively, Shailene Woodley, Elle Fanning, Chance the Rapper, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, both of whom walked our September show, Brooklyn Beckham and Romeo Beckham, Li Bingbing and Yao Chen among others, as well as the face of our new fragrance and brand ambassador, Jessica Chastain. In addition, in the U.S. alone, we have three major magazine covers over the past couple of months featuring our collection dresses. These included Angelina Jolie on the cover of Harper's Bazaar 150th Anniversary issue, Jennifer Lawrence on the cover of Vogue for its 125 December anniversary issue, and J. Lo on the cover of Vanity Fair this month. Our sports marketing also had a good summer. Based on an outstanding season, 24-year-old Polo golf ambassador, Justin Thomas, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year, generating tremendous media exposure, including 520 million estimated impression at the PGA championship. And our sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament featured our successful create-your-own customization initiative with on-site printers that drove significant traffic to our shops. In addition, the special edition court sneaker, worn by on-court tournament staff, was completely sold out and attracted new consumers to our brand. Moving onto our third initiative, expanding our digital and international presence. We have significant growth potential in Asia, specifically in China, which represents our greatest geographic growth opportunity for the company. Over the past two years, we've elevated the brand in Asia and built a strong foundation for the business by improving quality of sales and overall profitability. We are now beginning to pivot to quality growth while continuing our productivity work. As you know, we are underrepresented in Asia, with only 13% of our business in the region. In the second quarter, constant currency revenue grew 4% in Asia and comparable store sales were up 3%. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of the year. A key driver of our Asia growth going forward will be Mainland China, where we have very low levels of penetration but strong brand awareness. In fiscal 2017, we generated approximately $50 million of revenue on Mainland China, which represents less than 1% of our total company revenue. Based on Millward Brown data, we know that Polo's aided brand awareness in Mainland China is 83%. This is a significantly higher figure than many of our competitors which have greater penetration than us in China. We will drive growth through both increased marketing and distribution, both online and with physical stores. Within marketing, we have increased our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers. We are tailoring social content to the Chinese consumer and dressing many Chinese celebrities with social followings nearing 1 billion in total. In September, we had over 12 million Chinese views of our fashion show. We're also ramping up our presence on digital platforms. And in the second quarter, we successfully launched on T-mall and JD.com, and with commerce on WeChat. On these sites, we are creating digital shop in shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. On WeChat, we sold out the limited-edition Polo shirt within 48 hours. We are offering many omnichannel features to Chinese consumers, including free in-store tailoring and returns and an innovative mobile-based product authentication process using WeChat to recognize QR codes. Complementing this digital presence in China, the team is successfully expanding our fleet of physical stores while also improving the profitability of the portfolio. Importantly we have a harmonized pricing architecture across channels. We've opened 15 smaller format stores year-to-date in Mainland China and by the end of fiscal 2018 we expect to have a total of 60 stores on the Mainland. We have a much more rigorous approach to site selection, and these stores are generating strong sales productivity and returns that are accretive to our overall business. The average age of our customer in these stores is 34 years old, with a 50-50 male-female mix. We're seeing clear demand for our higher-priced more fashion-forward merchandise and a higher accessories penetration rate in China compared to other geographies, which shows opportunity. These achievements provide strong proof points for our accelerated growth strategy in Mainland China. Taken together with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, our goal for Greater China is to reach almost $0.5 billion of revenue in five years from about $170 million in fiscal 2017, driven by both comp growth and new distribution guidance. We will continue to act with rigor in this market and are committed to elevating the brand and delivering sustainable, profitable growth. In closing, we are moving in the right direction with a clear focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders by continuing to drive productivity and reigniting quality growth. Ralph and I have the same vision for the brand and the same goal, which is to get our great company back to winning. He and I are deeply committed to evolving how our iconic brand is experienced and expressed to win over consumers. We will continue to build on our early progress by driving the four key initiatives I outlined. Elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and distribution; evolving our product and marketing to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; expanding our digital and international presence; and working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results showed strong progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality of sales improvements are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow. Our performance this quarter was achieved despite meaningful impact from the tragic hurricanes that affected Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. In total, we experienced about 1 point of comp pressure in North America as a result of the hurricanes. But our results do not tell the full story, and I am incredibly proud of our teams for their swift and tireless actions to ensure that all our employees were safe, to bring relief their communities and to reopen our stores quickly following these devastating events. Let me now turn to our results. Second quarter revenues declined 9% on both a reported basis and in constant currency, which was at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, 100 basis points above last year on a reported basis and 70 points higher in constant currency. Gross margin in the second quarter was up 300 basis points to last year and up 290 basis points in constant currency, driven by both average unit retail increases and discount rate reductions. Consistent with previous quarters, approximately half of the increase was driven by reduced promotional activity and half by favorable geographic and channel mix. We also remain on track with our target expense savings for the year. Operating expenses were down 5% to last year in the second quarter, driven by rightsizing our cost structure, closing unprofitable distribution and changing product development processes through SKU optimization. This productivity allows us to fund our early growth initiatives while delivering our performance commitments for the year. Moving on to our segment performance. Starting with North America. We continue to execute our plan to come back to profitable growth. Revenue was down 16% in the second quarter, reflecting substantial progress on quality-of-sales initiatives. Despite the challenging top line, our team was able to expand adjusted operating margin 150 basis points. In North America wholesale, we continue to take deliberate actions to ensure the health of our brand and to set us up for long-term success. Execution progress this quarter focused on distribution closures, brand exits, off-price reductions, receipt fullbacks and lower promotional level. These actions accounted for approximately 70% of the 22% decline in the U.S. wholesale revenue this quarter. Our pullback in the off-price channel drove lower penetration within our North America wholesale business. This will continue through the remainder of the year. Consumer demand and channel dynamics remained challenging in North America wholesale and contributed to comp declines estimated in the mid- to high single digits. However, our digital wholesale business continued to be a highlight and posted growth last year. We are addressing the weak underlying demand by evolving our product and marketing and by investing in our wholesale store environments to improve the consumer experience. As an example, as part of our Stadium launch in September, we dropped a special capsule of knitwear items with the famous P wing logo in select Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores with customers lining up for the product overnight. As Patrice highlighted, early reads on fall product performance in Polo has shown an improving trend, which is promising. In our directly operated e-commerce business in North America, comps were down 18% in the quarter, as expected, but gross margin expanded significantly as we continued our strategy to aggressively reduce promotional activity to both ensure price coherency across our channel and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience for our digital flagship consumer. Following our decision to shift to a cloud-based e-commerce platform, our digital and IT teams moved with urgency and outstanding dedication to implement the platform switch in time for the upcoming holiday season. As a result of their work, two weeks ago, we went live with our new cloud-based platform for RalphLauren.com in North America. Now that our new infrastructure platform is in place, we will grow the digital flagship experience for our customers by adding functionality and evolving the creative to the second half of this year. As the new site develops, it will help us create a more brand-enhancing and consistent experience for consumers and better insights and functionality for us. Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 4% on a reported basis and was relatively flat with prior year in constant currency in the second quarter. Our teams in Europe delivered adjusted operating profit growth with margins up 350 basis points to last year and up 370 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. Wholesale revenue in Europe decreased 1% in constant currency. The negative impact of brand exits and significant reductions in off-price liquidation was partially offset by a shift in shipment timing from the first quarter that benefited the second quarter. The underlying trend of the full price wholesale business is about flat to last year. In the retail channel, constant currency comps were down 6% in Europe as we continued quality of sales work to rebalance pricing levels across channels. While this impacted comp growth negatively in the second quarter, gross margin and AUR were both up and the discount rate was down significantly. Going forward, we will continue this focus in Europe, which will negatively impact comps. This is similar to the strategy we pursued in Asia, and they are now delivering positive comps. Turning to Asia. Revenue was flat to last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was up 750 basis points and up 580 basis points in constant currency. Our team is reigniting growth in the Asia region while continuing to focus on productivity. This was the second quarter of positive comps, which increased 3% in constant currency, comp growth was driven by increased traffic and conversion and were keyed in the context of strong quality-of-sales initiatives. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and continue our marketing initiatives to amplify the brand. Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. In the second quarter, we opened 14 stand-alone stores and 34 concessions. We closed 12 stand-alone stores and 37 concessions, ending this quarter with 469 stand-alone stores and 622 concessions on a global basis. At yearend, we expect our stand-alone count to be up slightly to last year and our concession network to have a net increase of 20 locations, primarily in Asia. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year and is a reflection of the operational progress we are making. At the end of the second quarter, inventory declined 26% to $865 million versus last year. This inventory reduction is driven by prior year restructuring actions and more effective buying processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand. We ended the second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short- and long-term investments, up from $1.1 billion at the end of last year's second quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $590 million versus $692 million last year. We generated $362 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from $67 million in the prior year period. Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and other charges. We are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal 2018 and raising the low end of our operating margin guidance. We continue to expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Brand and distribution exits in both wholesale and retail account for approximately half of the decline, with quality-of-sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder, partially offset by new distribution and product and marketing initiatives. Foreign currency is now expected to have approximately 80 basis points of benefit to revenue growth in fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of minimal impact, given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates. Based on performance in the first half and targeted investments in the fourth quarter, we now expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 9.5% to 10.5% in constant currency, up from our previous guidance of 9% to 10.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of 40 to 50 basis points of pressure. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be down 6% to 8% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have approximately 160 to 170 basis points of benefit to revenue growth. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be down 50 to 70 basis points in constant currency. While we expect gross margin to continue to expand into the third quarter, SG&A rate will create some pressure as we start the lap last year's expense reductions and invest in growth initiatives around marketing, product and stores. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by approximately 10 to 20 basis points in the third quarter. Looking towards the fourth quarter, revenue will continue to be pressured for two reasons : First, we expect to shift in wholesale shipments that benefit Q3 and pressure Q4; second, a large portion of the March quarter is driven by clearance sales post-holiday. To support our quality-of-sales initiatives, we have planned for less clearance inventory, which will limit the clearance sales volumes this year year-over-year. This will offset some of the benefits from the Easter shift in Q4. Also for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A expenses to grow versus last year as we accelerate our marketing initiatives and grow our marketing investments double-digits in the second half. We believe this is the right decision for the long term as we balance near-term margin pressure with setting the company up to return to growth. In terms of restructuring charges, we continue to expect approximately $200 million for the year. In the second quarter, we recognized $30 million of restructuring and other charges. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be approximately 25% and for the third quarter to be approximately 23%. Let me finish by reviewing our priorities for cash and capital structure. In times of dynamic change, a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to the capital markets. Within that context, our first priority for cash is to invest in our business and lay the foundation for future profitable growth. Our second priority is to return capital to shareholders with a commitment to maintaining our dividend. Excess cash flow beyond current and future investment and dividend needs will be considered for future potential share repurchases. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018. We make this determination based on the cash needs of our business, sector dynamics and with consideration for the uncertain environment around U.S. tax reform. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are estimated at $225 million, down from the previous guidance of $300 million. We want to shift capital investments behind consumer-facing initiatives that have a demonstrated proof-of-concept and healthy rate of return. In closing, we continue to make strong progress on our operational efficiencies. We are elevating our brand and have strengthened our balance sheet and improved our cash flow so that we have the resources to fuel future profitable growth. This, combined with Ralph's enduring vision and the commitment of our teams around the world, puts us in a strong position to drive value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Matthew Boss : Thanks and nice early progress. So Patrice, on the four initiatives you outlined, and as we think about that time line for change here, what inning would you say each of the 4 initiatives fall into that? Patrice Louvet : Good morning Matt. So let's take them one by one. First, elevating the brand through quality of sales and distribution. I think as you've heard, we've made a very good progress on improving the quality of our distribution, shutting down stores, exiting brands like denim and supply, pulling back in wholesale both in terms of points of distribution. You know we're down 20% to 25% points of distribution in department stores. And also, as Jane just mentioned, significantly reducing shipments to the off-price channel's. So if you use a baseball analogy, which is very topical, this morning, I'd say probably seventh inning when it comes to quality of distribution. On the progress for quality of sales, I'd say, on this one, we're making good progress. You've seen us reduce the discounts and that's very visible through the 5% increase in AUR this past quarter. I struggle to provide an inning on this one because this is a game that never stops, right. We want to continuously reduce our level of discounting and improve our quality of sales. So that's on the first one. On the second one, our product and marketing. I'd say early days on products, so probably the first inning. We're beginning to see the benefits of the work that started many months ago, starting to appear in-store now. You heard some of the examples that we quoted. I think what we're seeing is a more disciplined assortment. We're seeing fewer SKUs, we're seeing the beginning of our limited additions. So, again, I think probably first inning there. I'd also say probably first inning on marketing. You've seen the support behind the show. We're getting more influencers to come into the brand, but a lot of our programs actually are going to start to kick in more in Q3, Q4 and beyond. So I'd say very, very early days on this one as well, with a lot more to come. On the third one, which is expanding our digital and our international presence, likewise, I think we're early earnings on digital. We very clear, that's going to be a good vector of growth for us in the future both in North America and globally. I think as we talked altogether a few weeks back, we really look at digital through three lenses, our own site, wholesale.com and pure players, our own sites or RalphLauren.com, Jane talk about the site that we just re-launched our platform and so now, it's about creating an amazing experience for consumers. That's going to happen over the next few months, so I'd say probably first inning on that one as well. Wholesale.com is something we're really keen to win in, so not just play, but play to win, which means growing share. We have really good partnerships across the various regions on that. Couple encouraging data points for this past quarter, we actually grew share in wholesale.com in Europe in Q2, and we grew share in wholesale.com in the U.S. on men's apparel and women's apparel. So we're encouraged by that, obviously a lot more to be done but a key vector of growth for us in the future as well. And then finally, on pure players, it's early days as well because if you look obviously, we have a very good partnership with Zalando in Europe and very happy with how that's playing out. We just signed up with Tmall, JD.com and WeChat, so it's been weeks so a lot more to be done on that front. But excited about what we can do and where we can go. On international, and what's exciting on international is there's no lack of opportunity. When you look at how our business splits today international and North America. We have significant growth potential in our international. You've heard us call out China and Mainland China as our number one priority internationally. The team on the ground has done a lot of work to get the fundamentals right over the past couple of years, so now it's really about accelerating our growth. So I'd say early innings in terms of the accelerating the growth. We're opening stores, we're expanding our digital footprint. We're being more active in terms of marketing with the Chinese consumer. And then, finally, our fourth initiative, which is working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. So as you've seen I think through the numbers, the team has done I think a very good job on productivity. And this is one where I can't innings either because this game never stops, right, productivity is going to be something we're going to do nonstop in addition to reigniting growth. We know we have areas of cost that we can do a better job on and everyone's really focused on being as effective and efficient as we can be across the entire business. And then on agility, which is critical to winning today's context, I'd say, early innings as well. We're putting a lot of emphasis culturally on empowerment and enablement and driving a sense of urgency, putting decisions on the clock so that we just move with pace because that's what the consumers and the retailer landscape demands if we're going to get back to winning. So, overall, as we kind of summarize the game, some phases are kind of midway through the game towards the later end of the game, assuming the game ends in nine innings. And others were at the very beginning, which I think is quite exciting for what's possible moving forward for us. Jane Nielsen : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Tunick with RBC. You may ask your question. Brian Tunick : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Brian. Brian Tunick : Good morning, Jane. Two question, maybe Patrice can talk about how he envisions maybe the North America channel mix, particularly maybe in wholesale. What do you think the right mix of the department stores versus off-price or digital wholesale should look like over the next couple of years? And then as we think about the revenue growth maybe in the next year or two , should we be thinking about that stabilization next year, is there a chance to grow once we get beyond sort of this pullback in distribution and quality of sales? Thanks very much. Patrice Louvet : Yeah, good morning, Brian. So let me take the first one on the channel dynamics. So we really look at the whole ecosystem ranging go-to-market ecosystem, ranging from flagships all the way to off-price. And all the channels have a role to play for us in the future, obviously, including wholesale. Specifically, I think as we look at wholesale, the areas we're focused on there is getting the foundations healthy, right. As I mentioned earlier, the challenging our distribution, make sure we have the right product that we show up in the right way in department stores and then we have the right marketing that goes with it. But we do expect abutment stores continue to play an important role for us moving forward. I want to double-click on the wholesale.com part because that's an important growth factor for us in the future, as I mentioned earlier. Off-price also has a role to play for us moving forward, but we actually want to deemphasize the role of off-price in our total business. We believe you've kind of a bit of our ahead of our in this channel, and so what it has a role to play and our consumers there anyone to appeal to. We are pulling back on off-price and we'll continue to do that for the rest of the overtime. Jane Nielsen : Yeah, Brian I would say that definitely, as we think about the future, you're going to see, as you did this quarter, less penetration in our total wholesale mix from off-price. And obviously, as Patrice called out, digital has been a highlight in wholesale. So I'd expect that to increase in penetration. And certainly, we have an opportunity once we right-sized wholesale to get back to share growth. So those are sort of how we think about the total ecosystem. As I think about revenue growth following quality-of-sales initiatives, we absolutely believe that after we get through our rightsizing and quality-of-sales initiatives, quality of sales is going to be an ongoing scene I think it will be about balance and - but following the reset that we would get back to growth and obviously. As Patrice said, in June, we're going to come back and play out the initiatives in more detail and give you a better road map for the timing of our financial metrics and our come back to growth. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. You may ask your question. Kate McShane : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wondered with regards to China, sounds like you're seeing some nice green chutes. Wondered what makes this launch into China the right strategy, what have you learned about the region that you think you understand more than you did before when you pursue this market? And is there product segmentation with the region, is there more of an emphasis on one particular segment like Polo? Patrice Louvet : So we have relatively long history in China as a company actually. Right, so if I kind of rewind the tapes a little bit, we've come through three phases. The early phase was through licensees, which ended up building distribution that I think in hindsight wasn't the right distribution for us. So when the company took over the license in 2010, a lot of our distribution was shut down and then there was an emphasis put on luxury with the expectation that establishing the brand at the high end would be the right way to enter the market, which I think strategically was spot on, because that is the type of equity we want to build for the brand in all new markets, particularly in a market like China. But obviously, we ended up being challenged in the overall economic model of being able to support a business that was exclusively focused on luxury. So that did not play out I think as the way it was originally intended. So we now have the benefit of all those learning's for this third phase where we are going to focus really on establishing Polo as the core of the business. We will obviously drive our luxury business as well to drive overall image, but the heart of the business for us in China will be Polo. We're also very clear in terms of how we want to show up relative to the ecosystem, the go-to-market ecosystem I was referring to earlier, with an almost digital first mindset, so I think you've heard us talk about how we're now on WeChat, JD.com and T-mall and then also opening different store format that we have historically there. So slightly smaller stores, more focused on Polo and the early results that we're seeing are quite encouraging. We're also tailoring our marketing to the Chinese consumers. So I think you heard us share some examples of celebrities that we're working with in China, and we actually have a long list of terrific partners in that market. That's really resonating with the Chinese consumer and then likewise, on product, we're looking at this through the lens of the local consumer, what is the local consumer excited about, what they're looking for and how do we ensure we serve them in a very unique way. We just spent couple of weeks in Asia actually, Jane and I, including a lot of timing in China. And what was exciting to hear from our teams and the stores is the demand there is for our higher priced products on Polo, with consumers really looking for more elevated products and accessories. So we're actually feeling pretty good about where the demand is for our brands there. And you heard me talk earlier, and I'll stop here and turn it over to Jane, but about the average age of our consumer in China which also gives us a lot of hope for the future, our average age is 34 years old, right, which is really in the sweet spot of where we want to be, good 50-50 male-female mix. So I think we're well up for success there. But as we've also called out in the remarks, we will proceed cautiously and we'll be very rigorous in the way we approach our investments moving forward in China. Jane Nielsen : Yeah, Kate, I can't say enough about how important the resetting of the base and the elevation of the brand has been in building our confidence for China in the future. As you can see in our segment reporting, just three years ago, we were not profitable in the Asia region and specifically, in China. And the team has done tremendous work as you've seen notably in this quarter in Asia to really expand operating margin. So that now, China and Asia growth is accretive over all Ralph Lauren growth. And so from a profitability standpoint and a healthy base standpoint, we're on solid footing. The brand is in great shape. We've cleaned up our distribution, which is an effort that we're continuing, and we are opening doors in a way that makes sense. We've got flagships that build the brand. We've got Polo doors that are smaller footprint that have excellent four-wall profitability that we're building out. And as you can see, we're building out a system of concessions that get us reach with our Chinese consumers and also provide a very healthy ROI. The gross margin in Asia is the highest that we have in the company. And so building and scaling in the Asia market is an opportunity to continue to expand operating margin, but to really be a significant factor of growth for us. The time is certainly right, and we have the right team and we are in the right position to do so now. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen and Company. You may ask your question. John Kernan : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jane Nielsen : Sure. John Kernan : Patrice, you obviously, have a lot of experience globally and Ralph Lauren's a global brand, just wondering, how you thinking about Europe. We've seen a transfer a lot of global apparel brands improve in Europe recently. I'm wondering when do you think Europe can become a growth market for Ralph Lauren again? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, John. Thanks for your question. Well, yeah, I mean, internationally, we have both distribution growth opportunities as well as comp growth opportunities. So clearly, exciting potential for us moving forward. We just talked about Asia has been paying this penetrated market, and obviously, our primary growth driver there will be Mainland China. Looking at Europe, right now we're implementing an enhanced focus on quality of sales and distribution where I think, again, we got ahead of our season on distribution in some parts of Europe and we have to wheel that back. We're also working on getting the right level of discounting in that market. So that's going to create some pressure on the number of transactions and comps in the short-term. However, in the long-term, we - to your point, I think, have significant growth opportunities both from a distribution and comp growth standpoint. We actually - so Jane and I have been traveling quite a bit we were in Europe 10 days ago, U.K., Germany, France where we spent a lot of time in the market understanding where we are and what the opportunities are. One interesting data point is across Europe, we only have I think the precise number is 19 full price stores across the entire region, which is an indication of the upside potential that we have there look at our store footprint. We also have very promising progress on digital, I mentioned Zalando earlier and many other partners that we're working with that also indicated the significant upside there. Then finally, as we toured a number of our wholesale partners, we know we can do a better job with our wholesale partners in Europe. So I think across all these sectors, once we've completed the work quality of sales, which is critical, we have significant growth opportunity across the region. For example, we don't have a store, dedicated store in Spain, which is relatively sizable market. So we will get the balance right between Asia and Europe, but we're certainly looking at both regions that's growth vectors for us in the future. Jane Nielsen : Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Omar Saad : Thanks, good morning. Thanks for all the information. Nice quarter. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Omar. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask about products. Patrice, you mentioned fashion forward product having a feel, I think that comment was probably more specific to Asia and China. But I wanted to kind of ask you more broadly how do you think about managing the different trends going on in the marketplace as you evolve product line? Retro trends, fashion forward trends, the traditional kind of core heritage around the brand, maybe help us understand how you're thinking about evolving the product, where you it needs to go in concert with their efforts with Ralph's and the creative team? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Sure. Good morning, Omar. So we're looking at multiple vectors to evolve our product offering. The first one, which is going to sound pretty basic was actually critical. It's really driving a more disciplined assortment. Having more discipline and understanding the role of this that we're introducing, eliminating the unproductive styles, better balancing offering across categories across price points, to have good, better, best propositions across the categories that matter. The second point is there's a critical timelessness to this brand, and we have phenomenal icons and I think we've all come to the conclusion that we can do more with our Icons and put greater emphasis on our Icons and that as part of what - the early progress we are seeing this Fall season is actually driven by what's happening with our Icons. The third area is the renewal of our - and again, this is a very important part of our business. On this area, we are looking at fits, we're looking at styles, we're looking at materials, we're looking at colors. And you can imagine, I've been very impressed by the design team that we have in-house and have had a number of conversations with them, they're very in touch with what's going on in the market, both here and around the world, and really making sure that our propositions moving forward. Take that into account, while also staying true to who we are, right. So we're not going to be jerked around by all the fashion trends out there in the market and lose kind of the fundamental what this brand stands for and the timelessness of it. We will be in touch with the trends while staying true to who we are, and obviously, making sure that what we offer is exciting and relevant for the consumers that we want to serve. You heard me talk about the limited editions and we've been excited about the reactions, the stadium and actually pretty need to see the long lines, the night before outside stores where people waiting to buy it. So we're going to continue to drive that, we're going look at partnerships moving forward as well, which I think will bring even more interest and excitement to the brand. And then the final point, which is less about trends and style, it's more about strategic choices. There are three categories where we should be playing more actively, where we are underdeveloped and where I believe we have a basis to win. So that will also be another vector of growth as we look at overall product offering. Evren Kopelman : Next question please? Operator : The next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you for taking my call. Just actually a follow-up on Omar's question. Can you talk about how you're thinking about product in terms of your different channels distribution, off-price versus full-line versus outlet, and how you're going to differentiate between those channels? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Heather. That's also a great question. And the headline thought here is we know we need to do a better job differentiating our propositions across channels. Things have gotten blurred and I don't think it's helping the consumer kind of navigate our brand and we want to get really clear on the role of each channel and what the value proposition is in each channel for our brand and drive greater differentiation. And there are many different ways to drive differentiation, whether its different styles, different categories, how the products are presented and so on, and so forth. But clearly an area of focus for us moving forward, we need to and we will drive a stronger differentiation across the channels that we operate in. Jane Nielsen : Heather, I do think that the inventory discipline in the - and the buying process discipline that we put in place will enable us to differentiate product assortments, but also maintain of the SKU efficiency and inventory efficiencies that we've been able to drive over the last year. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Nancy Hilliker : Hi, everyone. This is Nancy Hilliker on for Ike. Great job. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Nancy Hilliker : Our question - hi. Our question is obviously, you had an amazing gross margin in the quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about more about puts and takes in the back half? And given the shift, what we should expect, any into the quarters for gross margin and also actually for SG&A as well? Jane Nielsen : So, Nancy, as we look at gross margin in the second quarter, we feel that we'll have gross margin expansion in the second half of at least 150 basis points. So as we move forward and we're seeing our gross margin trends, we've been confident in moving up that guidance on gross margin. What you'll see in the second half in terms of SG&A is a real shift in the fourth quarter where we are going to be investing in new stores, but most notably, marketing. Jonathan Bottomley, our new Head of Marketing, has been on board. And we have a Polo campaign coming out and some real amplification in marketing. In fact, if you look at our marketing spend, as you can see in the Q, that's been down in the first half, and it's going to be up significantly in the second half, around double-digit in the third quarter, but up significantly in the fourth quarter. As we really believe marketing and telling our story is a great opportunity for us and a great opportunity to really get back to telling our story to position us for growth. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Company. You may ask your question. Rick Patel : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the progress. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Rick Patel : A follow-up question on expenses. So you talked about investments in marketing, product and stores. Can you dig a little deeper and talk about which geographies will receive the most investment? I'm curious about how you're weighing investment in North America, which is your most challenging market right now, versus investing in growth areas like Asia? And if I can squeeze in a quick housekeeping one, any updates to report on tourism given the changes in FX? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Of course. So on the expense side, and as we think about investments by market, obviously, with our growth focus in Asia, that market will need more marketing. The marketing we've put is very effective, as Patrice noted. Our top-of-mind awareness in China is very high and really is another thing that gives us confidence for growth. So you'll see marketing go up in China. Also, as we called out in our store profile, most of the new doors that are being opened are being opened in Asia, and most of the concessions that we're opening this year will be opened in Asia. So capital will be shifting to the China market as we build out. You'll also see capital going into Europe as we realize the opportunity for some greater store penetration in Europe, as well as some marketing. In North America, what the focus in capital will be is more refurbishment, how do we refresh our store environment. We're fully, although there'll be some close store here opened ones there, but it really our opportunity is to show up really well in North America and give some of our stores the love that they deserve in terms of refurbishment. You'll see marketing also in the U.S. I think we have to get back to telling our story in the U. S. Notably, on our digital site, as we - now that the - we're switched on our platform, you're going to see, especially in the third - later third and fourth quarter, more digital assets show up in marketing on our digital sites, but also telling our story in the market but in a much more digitally savvy social media way. Patrice Louvet : There is a question, actually the latest data in North America for our U.S. retail stores, basically, sales are down low single digits. And in our European stores, sales were down from tourists mid-single digits. So, better in North America than we've seen in the long, long time actually this past quarter. In Europe, it's still pretty stable in mid down mid-singles. Jane Nielsen : Trend continues in this quarter was up nicely, so it's encouraging. Patrice Louvet : Yes. Jane Nielsen : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Roberts on behalf of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. You may ask your question. Andrew Roberts : Hi. Good morning. So I guess, you guys launched T-mall and JD.com this quarter. I was wondering if you guys could give us any update on your thoughts of launching on Amazon in North America and elsewhere? Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Andrew. So let me rewind a little bit on your question just to give the bigger picture on how we're seeing e-commerce, and I will answer your question. As I mentioned earlier, so e-commerce is very clearly critical for our future growth. This is going to be the way for us to reach the consumers, where they are, in the most effective way to drive - to build the brand and to drive the business. I talked about the three buckets that we have, our own site, wholesales.com and pure players. When we look at pure players, the model we really like is actually the T-mall model where we manage our own shop in the - on their marketplace and we have a digital storefront for the brand. That's the model we're excited about. So we continue to evaluate online partners including the one you just quoted. So we want to make sure we win in this channel. But we're also looking to do it in a way that we can build a brand and that we can show up the way the brand is intended to show up. So nothing new to report on Amazon in particular. Evren Kopelman : We will take one last question. Operator : The last question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. You may ask your question. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Jane, I want to ask about the North American wholesale business I think it was mentioned it was down 22% and 70% of that was driven by active measures. How should we think about those metrics for the third and fourth quarter and potentially beyond? Jane Nielsen : So we're comfortable with our guidance in terms of our total wholesale outlook, and specifically for North America, as we said. We expect that we'll see wholesale end the year in about the same range that you saw in Q2, so we're down about 22% Q2. I expect the full year will look about similar as our cleanup continues through the third and fourth quarter. We are encouraged by what we see as progress on execution. Our underlying comp rate, as we view it, is in the mid to high single digits, and we know what we have product and marketing that we need to focus on as well as the store refreshments to change that trend as we move into FY 2019. So about similar to the year to what you saw in this quarter, but I think that the pretty stable underlying comp trend that we are looking to address as we look at all the vectors product marketing and stores. Patrice Louvet : Good. So we're going to close here. Thank you all for joining our call this morning. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a great day. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Evren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased to report better-than-expected results for the third quarter, as we continue to execute on our key initiatives, especially during the important holiday season. We still have a lot of work to do to return to industry-leading revenue and earnings growth, but these results give us confidence that we are on the right track. If you recall from our last call, we're focused on reigniting growth, while continuing to drive productivity. And it is this balance that will create value for our stakeholders. To do so, we're executing against four key initiatives : first, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product; second, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. Let me take you through the progress we made across each in the third quarter, starting with our first key initiative, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product. In the third quarter, we continued to reduce our discount rates and increase our average unit retail. AUR was up 4% across the company's direct-to-consumer network similar to the first half of the year. Our North America holiday sales were ahead of plans, even with reduced promotions versus last year. Importantly, this was achieved in the context of a marketplace with high levels of promotional activity. We continue to improve the quality of our distribution, by closing unproductive doors and reducing off-price penetration within wholesale. This contributed to 250 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin, building on our gains from the first half of the year. We're also making progress in improving quality of product as we reallocate more of a production volume to a network of factories that consistently deliver superior quality. Moving on to our second key initiative, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. Within products our strategy has the following five key elements : driving a much more disciplined assortment; focus on our icons, renew our core items to create more appeal with today's consumer; develop interest through newness and innovation including limited editions; capsule collections and personalization to inject energy and excitement into our brand; and finally, drive under-developed categories that have high potential. I want to share a few ways we're progressing across these elements from the third quarter. Starting with assortment discipline, this season had a double-digit reduction in the number of SKUs, as we continue to cut the unproductive tail, driving clarity of message, increased productivity and higher sell-throughs. Furthermore, year to date, revenue per SKU is up 18% and gross profit per SKU is up 23% to last year. The focus on our icons was evident in our fall and Holiday assortment. Our Polo Bear sweaters and novelty items embellished with our iconic symbols like our Crest Logo and Downhill Ski Racer graphic were among our best sellers for the season. Our renewed core items were also key to our seasonal performance. The sales trend in Polo, our largest brand, improved in both men's and women's apparels. This is a result of the work Ralph and our creative teams have been doing to elevate and evolve our core product with increased functionality and refreshed fabrics, silhouettes and color palettes. Some of our best performers included those with additional functionality such as Washable Merino Sweaters, outer wear with seam seals, and denim and chinos with stretch. We saw increased full price sell-through with higher AURs and gross margins versus last year. When it comes to developing interest through limited editions and other innovations, this quarter we built on the success of our create our own pilot at the US Open, by extending it to our Prince Street Store, New York City and RalphLauren.com. This initiative provides consumers with the opportunity to create a one of a kind, personalized design, in store and online. We're seeing good traction. At Prince Street, we saw incremental sales, improved conversion and higher gross margin. Early indications also show that consumers purchasing customized products are typically younger and new to our retail store channel. On RalphLauren.com, custom items are in the top selling styles in their categories for both men and women. Lastly, in products, we're focusing on underdeveloped categories that has significant growth potential across our brands. One of these categories is denim. Based on recent consumer research, we believe that we have a clear basis to win in this category. With the Fall and Holiday season, we were pleased to see the traction in denim, with updated fits, washes and lighter weights. Our denim business is up 8% year to date with improved gross margins. So as you can see, we're making encouraging progress across multiple fronts on product. But there's still more work to do ahead of us. Moving on to marketing, our strategy to increase reach and appeal with new consumers has the following four key elements : adopt a more consumer-centric approach; shift marketing investments to the channel that matter most of our consumers; drive greater integration across consumer touch points; and finally, put more emphasis on marketing measurement and analysis. We are developing deeper knowledge of consumer behaviors and being more precise about how we engage specific consumer groups. This will enable our marketing investments to be more effective and efficient. In order to expand the brand's reach globally and increase consumer demand, we are shifting to more digital and more social platforms. With a focus on influencers and strategies that drive traffic to our e-commerce channels. As an example, in the third quarter, on Singles' Day in China, we partnered with celebrity Chinese model He Sui, to introduce the Polo Bear limited edition on Tmall. This event attracted more than 100 million live views and impressions on TV and social media across China. We're also experimenting with new channels to drive further engagement with the younger consumer, for example, we launched our first ever Snapchat activation as part of our create-your-own product customization promotion. We expect to build on the momentum we are seeing on digital platforms. Our Instagram followers are up 40% over the last year. And our WeChat fan-base is up 50% over the last three months. When it comes to influencers, we believe in investing in long-term relationships, with those who have an authentic connection to the brand and influence the areas of culture that matter most to our audiences. We built on our influencer and celebrity coverage in the third quarter, with dressing activity including Gigi and Bella Hadid, Jennifer Lawrence, Blake Lively, J.Lo, Chance the Rapper, Zendaya and Jessica Chastain, as well as Fan Bingbing, Karen Mok, GEM [ph], and JJ Lin in Asia. An illustration of greater integration across consumer touch-points this quarter has been the Holiday Polo Bear campaign. We created a consistent experience for the consumer as we integrated the message across product, digital media and our sales channel. We featured our iconic Polo Bear across store windows globally, in video content on social media and through collaborations with influencers. Finally, in terms of upgrading our shopping experience. We continue to invest in our store environments in the third quarter. In wholesale, we've refreshed a number of our shops and have seen improved sales and margin trends versus control doors and pretest trends. This activity will continue in partnership with our key customers. In retail, refreshes and renovations are elevating the store environment especially in our factory stores, driving improved gross margins ahead of our expectations. We have more of these projects in the pipeline for fiscal 2019. Moving onto our third key initiative, expanding our digital and international presence. Last quarter I spoke in detail about our growth potential in Asia, specifically in China. We had strong performance in China in the third quarter, which Jane will review in a moment. This quarter, I want to highlight our digital initiatives. It goes without saying the digital is critical to our future growth as the consumer continues to shift online. The shift is not only for purchases, but as a whole ecosystem of touch-points from product research to product reviews and ongoing brand interaction through social media, digital marketing and digital own content. Across the company, we are pivoting to digital-first mindset in order to position our business to win in the new digital world. On the e-commerce front, our strategy has three pillars; one, our directly operated websites; two, department store websites; and three, digital pure players. Starting with our directly operated websites, RalphLauren.com is our digital flagship. And our vision is to make you the best most elevated expression of our brand. To deliver that vision, we've been significantly pulling back on the level of deep discounting to improve quality of sales. Fiscal 2018, we are driving nearly 700 basis points of reduction in the penetration of third and fourth markdown sales in our North America e-commerce business. We also recently transition our U.S. site to a new technology platform that offers a better mobile experience and functionality like improved search and more seamless checkout process. We'll continue to add functionality like customer reviews, chat and personalization, and are beginning to upgrade the creative look and feel of the site to build the richer experience and capture new consumers. In fiscal 2018, we estimate that our global directly operated e-commerce business will generate approximately $380 million of revenue. As we look forward to fiscal 2019 with our new site in place and the major promotional pullback behind us, our goal is to start to build quality traffic and grow revenue on our U.S. site. The strategy for digital flagship is to emphasize brand experience, develop digital content around RalphLauren.com that drives deeper consumer engagement and conversion as well as offer more omnichannel services like pickup and return in store. Moving onto department store websites, this business is healthy and growing. We've been gaining market share in key categories at our key partners. The penetration of the department-store-dot-com business to our total department store sales is in the high-teens and growing. Moving forward, in order to accelerate share growth, we will collaborate even more closely with key partners to leverage consumer insights to better reach and convert traffic. Lastly on digital pure players, this is the fastest growing part of our e-commerce presence and it allows us to attract younger consumers into the brand. We are partnering closely with our pure play customers of marketing events, optimizing search and other data analysis to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands. Our pure play business is more developed in Europe and other parts of the world, as we've been building relationships with key players for a number of years there. We currently sell-through over 40 online retailers in Europe, including Zalando, Boozt, ASOS, YOOX and MR PORTER. In Asia, our network is developing and we were focused on driving a full price strategy with limited discounting. We currently work with 11 pure players including T-mall, JD.com, WeChat, ZOZOTOWN, and THE ICONIC. In the U.S., we're beginning to launch with new brand appropriate sites, having added seven year-to-date with several more to come in the fourth quarter. As we explore pure play opportunities, what's most important to us is that the brand is presented appropriately and pricing integrity is maintained. We prefer the marketplace model where we have control over how we show up to the consumer. On these sites, we have created digital shop-in-shop environment with consistent brand experience, tailored product stories and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. As we look across department-store-dot-com and pure players, we are on track to generate approximately $580 million of global sales at retail in fiscal 2018. This is up approximately 9% to last year. We expect this channel to continue to grow as a percentage of our mix going forward. To support our digital expansion, we are investing in our talent and infrastructure. Last week we announced a number of significant changes in our digital organization, including the appointment of new senior leaders with strong backgrounds and critical technology and e-commerce positions. As well as our first ever Chief Digital Officer, Alice Delahunt. Alice joins us from Burberry, where she served as director of digital marketing and led digital innovation. She will be responsible for elevating our global digital platforms and enhancing the consumer experience across all digital channels to drive acquisition, conversion and retention. She will report directly to me as a member of the executive leadership team. These are just a few of the important steps we are taking to enhance our digital and e-commerce capabilities and build-up the platform. As we evolve and expand our work across digital, we expect the profitability of our digital operations to improve over time as we leverage our fixed cost asset base and drive productivity initiatives. To in closing, as I mentioned earlier, while we still have a lot of work to do to reach industry leading revenue and earnings growth. I believe, we are moving in the right direction with clear focus on initiatives that will reignite quality growth and continue to drive productivity across our business. Ralph and I are deeply committed to evolving our iconic brand is experienced and expressed across all the consumer touch-points. And we are proud of our organization that is coming together as one-team focused on the consumer driving superior execution across our key priorities. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane. And I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results, we're ahead of our expectations and show continued progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our quality of sales improvements are delivering higher AUR, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow. Our third quarter revenues declined 4% on a reported basis and 6% in constant currency. At the top end of our guidance, as our North America holiday sales we're ahead of our plans. I am proud of our teams for their strong execution this holiday season. They took our learnings from last year, worked across functions from store operations, supply chain and planning, to design merchandising and marketing. To ensure that our consumer saw enhanced product in our stores at a compelling value with inventory levels that match demand. These efforts across our teams delivered improved sell-through and higher gross margins with reduced promotions. With this holiday quarter, adjusted operating margin was 13.2%, up 40 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 10 basis points in constant currency. This was above our guidance driven by both better growth margins and lower SG&A expenses as our quality of sales initiatives and product performance exceeded our expectations. Adjusted gross margin in the third quarter was up 250 basis points to last year and up 220 basis points in constant currency. The most significant driver of the expanded gross margin was reduced discount rates and promotions, other drivers of the expansion were favorable geographic and channel mix. We are also seeing the benefits of our sourcing initiatives. Our shorter lead time products have lower markdown rates and higher full price sell-through. We remain on track to have 90% of our products on a nine month lead time by the end of this fiscal year and plan to drive further reductions in fiscal 2019. SG&A expenses were flat to last year in the third quarter, as savings from expense initiatives and store closures, funded a 27% increase in marketing spend. The growth in marketing comes after double-digit declines in the first half of this year. Ralph and our creative teams have been working collaboratively with our new Chief Marketing Officer, who joined us in April and we're excited to invest in these campaigns with greater execution in digital and social media channel. For context, our marketing investment for fiscal 2018 is planned to be up slightly to last year. The planned 30-plus growth in the second half balances out the reductions in the first half. Moving forward our goal is to continue to increase marketing. However, our objective is to fund the majority of the increases through productivity gains in other expense areas in order to achieve our long-term goal of expanding operating margin. Let me now review our segment performance. In North America, revenue was down 11% in the third quarter. However, adjusted operating margin was up 160 basis points, reflecting substantial progress on quality of sales and distribution initiatives. In wholesale, our sales continue to be pressured by our deliberate actions to ensure the health of our brand and to set us up for long-term success. North America wholesale revenue was down 15% in the third quarter, as we continue to pull back from the off-price channel and close unproductive distribution in department stores. For FY 2018, on a year to date basis our deliberate actions such as brand exits, off-price wholesale reductions, receipt pullbacks and lower promotional levels account for approximately two-thirds of the North America wholesale declines. Notably, off-price declined in penetration to our total North America wholesale business. The encouraging news is that our Fall/Holiday season sell-out performance, while still down to last year, improved from the spring/summer season. Furthermore, retailer margins expanded to last year. Importantly, our digital wholesale business continued its momentum, posting both sales growth and market share gains to last year at our key retailers and in our core categories. While there is more work to do, especially in off-price wholesale, we expect improvements in our wholesale revenue trend as we begin to overlap some of the deliberate actions and address the weak underlying demand by evolving our product, marketing and wholesale store environments. In our retail business in North America, holiday sales were ahead of our plans. While our brick-and-mortar comps were still down year-over-year, affected by our quality of sales initiatives and weak overall traffic, the 3% comp declines represented a modest improvement in trend. E-commerce comps in North America were down 27% in the third quarter. This was in line with our expectations and was impacted by our transition to a new technology platform in the quarter and by our continued quality of sales initiatives. This quarter, we had 11 fewer promotional days versus last year and we reduced discount depth, by at least 10 percentage points. Our deepest discount message was 50% off versus 65% off last year. In addition, we were more targeted in our promotions and excluded customized products, new arrival and some of our iconic items from the promotions this year. We expect our e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter to be similar to our first half trends with more substantial improvements expected in FY 2019. Moving on to Europe, revenue increased 8% on a recorded basis and was flat to last year in constant currency in the third quarter. Our team in Europe delivered adjusted operating profit growth with margins up 270 basis points and up 220 basis points in constant currency, driven by both gross margin expansion and expense leverage. Wholesale revenue in Europe increased 8% in constant currency. The underlying trend of the wholesale business is about flat to last year. However, the quarter benefitted from an easier compare due to a shift in timing of shipments in last year's third quarter. Similar to North America, our digital wholesale business in Europe continued to post growth to last year and expanded market share. In the retail channel, constant currency comps were down 8% in Europe. We intensified our quality of sales actions and face challenging traffic trends in our outlet centers, which experience the double-digit decline in foreign traffic. While, this impacted comp growth negatively gross margin and AUR will both up and the discount rate was down. Turning to Asia, revenue was up 7% on both a reported basis and in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points, and up 10 basis points in constant currency. This quarter had a challenging operating margin comparison in Asia due to the timing of certain expenses in last year's third quarter. When you look at the year-to-date period adjusted operating margin is up 540 basis points and up 390 basis points in constant currency. As we overlap strong quality of sales actions in the second half of last year. Our operating margin expansion will continue at a more normalized pace with top line growth driving operating profit dollar growth. Our team is driving growth in the Asia region, while continuing the focus on productivity. Comps increased 3% in constant currency in the third quarter continuing the positive comp trend from the first half of the year. Comp growth was achieved in the context of strong quality of sales initiatives, and was driven by increased conversion, a higher AUR and growth in the number of transactions. We expect further comp growth in Asia, as we continue to upgrade our distribution network and marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. We delivered stronger results in China, our key growth market in the region. Total revenue for the quarter was up 28% to last year in Mainland China, leading our growth in the Greater China region. We continue to increase our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers and celebrities. Turning to our store fleet. We continued to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. In the third quarter, we opened 15 stand-alone stores and 10 concessions. We closed three stand-alone stores and four concessions, ending the quarter with 481 stand-alone stores and 628 concessions on a global basis. We opened 10 new points of distribution in Mainland China in the quarter. And we are on track to have 60 points of distribution on the Mainland by the end of fiscal 2018. At year-end, we expect our stand-alone store count to be up slightly to last year, and our concession network to have a net increase of approximately 10 locations, primarily in Asia. Moving onto the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year. And it's a reflection of the operational progress we are making. We ended the third quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and investments, up from $1.5 billion at the end of last year's third quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $589 million flat to last year. Inventory declined 16% to $825 million at the end of the third quarter, and inventory turns improved, we will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand. We generated $828 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up from $625 million in the prior year period. Turning to the dynamic topic of taxes. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 22% before the impact of tax reform, restructuring and related charges, slightly below our guidance of 23% due to discrete one-time items. On a reported basis, tax reform increased our estimated tax expense with this quarter by approximately $231 million, this is primarily related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. This is a onetime charge that will largely be paid over an 8-year period. We have excluded this from our adjusted EPS of $2.03. Going forward based on our current interpretation of tax reform, our geographic mix of profits and available information, we estimate that our ongoing effective tax rates will decline by approximately 200 basis points, which equates to an annual net reduction in tax expense of approximately $12 million or $0.15 per share. This is driven by the lower U.S. corporate tax rate which is partially offset by the non-deductibility of performance-based compensation. For tax purposes, this is based on our FY 2018 geographic mix of profits where about a quarter of our pre-tax income is based in the U.S. We will continue the process of refining these estimates as additional information becomes available. Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and the onetime charge in the third quarter related to tax reform. We are maintaining our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal 2018 and raising the low-end of our operating margin guidance. We expect revenues to decline 8% to 9% for the year in constant currency. Foreign currency is now expected to have approximately 100 basis points of benefit to revenue growth in fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance of 80 basis points of positive impact, given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates. Brand and distribution exits, both in wholesale and retail account for approximately half the decline with quality of sales initiatives and challenging traffic trends representing the remainder, partially offset by new distribution and product and marketing initiatives. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect operating margin for fiscal 2018 to be 10% to 10.5% in constant currency, up from previous guidance of 9.5% to 10.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have 30 basis points of benefit to operating margin for fiscal 2018 versus previous guidance for minimal impact. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down 8% to 10% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Foreign currency is expected to have approximately 330 basis points of benefit to revenue growth. Revenue in the fourth quarter will be pressured for two reasons : first, a planned shift in timing of wholesale shipments, this shift benefited Q3 and will pressure Q4; second, in retail, a large portion of the March quarter is driven by clearance sales post-holiday. To support our quality of sales initiative, we have planned for less clearance inventory, which will limit clearance sales volumes year-over-year. This will more than offset the benefit of these Easter shift in Q4. We expect gross margin to continue to expand in the fourth quarter, however SG&A rate will see some pressure. While we continue to drive expense reductions, we are also investing in growth initiatives, especially in marketing. In the fourth quarter, our marketing investments will be up even more significantly than the third quarter. And we will be focused on our new Spring Polo campaign, featuring our iconic Polo Shirt. We will also fully amplify the coverage of our February fashion show and our sponsorship of the Winter Olympics. As a result, operating margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be down 240 to 260 basis points in constant currency. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by approximately 90 basis points. We continue to expect restructuring charges to approximate $200 million. However, from a timing perspective, we now expect approximately $130 million in fiscal 2018 and roughly $75 million to $85 million of lease-related cost to shift into FY 2019. In the third quarter, we recognized $27 million of restructuring and other charges. We now expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be around $200 million, lower than our previous guidance of $225 million as we shift certain capital expenses into fiscal 2019 and focus on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be approximately 23%, below our previous guidance of 25%. And for the fourth quarter, to be approximately 3%, due to the lower U.S. federal income tax rate as a result of tax reform and discrete items. When it comes to capital structure and priorities for cash, we are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating to provide strategic flexibility, liquidity and access to capital markets. Our first priority is to allocate capital investment to our growth initiatives. Our second priority for cash is to maintain and grow our dividend, followed by potential share repurchases. While we are planning no share repurchases for fiscal 2018, we will review our future plans with our Board of Directors at year-end. We are also currently evaluating the impact of the repatriation of our foreign cash under tax reform. In closing, we continue to make strong progress on our platforms for growth and our operational efficiencies. Our balance sheet is strong and we are growing our cash flows. We are elevating our brand across all channels and consumer touch-points to ensure that Ralph's enduring vision is translated in a compelling and consistent way. Our teams around the world are laser-focused on execution and realizing the value creating opportunity for all our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. You may ask your question. Robert Drbul : Hi, good morning. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Bob. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Bob. Robert Drbul : I guess, on this quarter, we've become accustomed to seeing you guys beat on the margin side, but this is the first quarter in a while that you came in at the high-end of the revenue guidance. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit more on the drivers around the top-line. Patrice Louvet : Sure, I mean, as you mentioned, I think we're actually encouraged by our revenue results in the quarter. I think we're really starting to see the early benefits of our key initiatives, right, with a specific focus on elevating our brand by improving quality of sales and quality of distribution and you heard us give some examples of that. And also evolving our product and our marketing so that we can really expand our reach and appeal with new consumers, and that's starting to play out, obviously early days. We're especially pleased with the in-store executions that our teams delivered in North America during the holiday season. And we also recognized we benefitted in the whole channel from a more positive sentiment in North America, so that's part of it. So I'd say, all in all progress, but we're also very clear we still have a lot more work to do in order to get back to high quality growth and continue the productivity progress that we've done, so we can deliver the shareholder value that everyone expects from this company. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. You may ask your question. Matthew Boss : Thanks. So, Patrice, last quarter you cited quality of distribution initiative. I think you said in the seventh inning and quality of sale actions is ongoing. I guess, to put this into perspective. Your guidance for this year is basically to end with roughly $6.1 billion revenue base. Are you comfortable that this is trough level or just help us to think about - do we need to think about further shrink prior to re-growing, just the best way to put into perspective, where you're at today with revenues and how best to think about going forward. Patrice Louvet : Okay, good morning, Matt. Most of the key interventions from a distribution and discounting standpoint are happening this fiscal year. So if you look at the interventions we've made in wholesale, full price on wholesale, if you look at the interventions we've made in terms of store closures, if you look at the interventions we've made online from a discounting standpoint, most of the big interventions are happening this fiscal year. So I think $6.1 billion is a good starting base. There is still for us a question mark as to our exposure in the off-price channel. So that's something that we're working through and we'll share how we're thinking about it, when we get together for the Investor Day in early June. But I'd say, in terms of key interventions of quality of sales, quality of distribution, we should be more or less complete by the end of the fiscal year. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura/Instinet. You may ask your question. Simeon Siegel : Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on that ongoing margin and inventory progress. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Simeon Siegel : Jane, any thoughts on where the gross margins can go from here and maybe the drivers there? And then, just as a reminder, on the EBIT level, the channel and geographic mix shifts are those accretive or dilutive at this point? Jane Nielsen : Can you say your EBIT question again? Simeon Siegel : Yes, I think you get the benefit with the channel and geographic mix shifts. I think it helps the margin just on the EBIT level. How does that play out? Jane Nielsen : Yeah, okay. So let's start with gross margin. I think you have seen us continuously drive gross margin. The number one driver is promotion and discount reduction. That is going to continue through next year. The sharp interventions that Patrice talked about will be over. But the quality of sales work, reducing discount rates smartly, targeting AIR increases. That work will continue and be a positive for gross margin. Our international growth is also going to be an enduring benefit to gross margin, as well as channel shift as we move into digital and as we move into our own store network, notably in Asia, those are all positive gross margin drivers. The magnitude of the benefit that we had as we shift out of wholesale and into more - strongly into direct-to-retail, that gross margin benefit will start to lessen versus what we've seen this year. But in terms of EBIT, which was the next part of your question, our direct-to-consumer EBIT margins benefit from that shift as we leverage growth. So what we're seeing is, in terms of overall EBIT accretion, we're growing operating margin in Asia, that's a net benefit. We expect that to - that margin expansion to continue over time. Europe, as it continues to grow is also EBIT enhancing and we're managing through getting better leverage on our fixed cost, notably at corporate, so that overall EBIT margin for Ralph Lauren can expand over time. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. You may ask your question. Kate McShane : Hi, thank you. Good morning. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Kate. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Kate. Kate McShane : My question was on Europe. I was wondering if you could break down in a little more detail some of the more macro impacts that impacted the quarter versus some of the company specific initiatives and factors. And in particular, when it comes to wholesale in Europe, can you help us understand what the comp growth is for that business versus what the opportunity or what growth we saw from the opening of new doors or new accounts? Patrice Louvet : Yeah, so let me break Europe into the first part of your question and then the second part of your question. So, what we saw in Europe was some challenging traffic trends, notably in our outlet stores. And we believe that relates to obviously what you saw in the strengthening euro, because we saw a significant drop in foreign tourist traffic, notably into our outlets in Europe. And that was across both our Chinese foreign tourist consumers as well as our Middle East consumers. So we saw those dynamics, again related to largely to the macro of currency dynamics. As I look at Europe wholesale business, the underlying trend for Europe wholesale is about flat. We've had some shipment timing movements that we try to call out as we move through the year, but as we step back from that, we think the underlying trend is about flat on a comp and on an ongoing basis. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Omar Saad : Thanks. Good morning. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Omar. Omar Saad : Actually I want to just - I just wanted to clarify, Jane, in terms of the dynamics affecting the fourth quarter revenue guidance, the planned brand and distribution exits, the ongoing quality of sales initiatives, less clearance and the wholesale shift. As we think about what's ongoing and what's kind of specific to the fourth quarter. Could you just clarify which one of those we should expect to continue? And then, I wanted to ask also about digital. What you learn - as you put your brand out there more, what you're learning about the brand? And where it's really effective and maybe where it's less effective as you put it out there more? Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Great. Why don't I take the Q4 guidance, and then I'll turn it - let Patrice answer your digital question. So as I - as we look at Q4 guidance, and we look at what's happening the denim and supply, the brand exits starts to abate in the fourth quarter. We're still heavily into the reset of our RL.com site from a pricing standpoint. So in the third quarter, we've overlapped the transition of the platform, but we expect the impact of repricing, which you saw on the first half of the year to continue on the trend basis. We'll be at the tail end of the majority of our distribution exits, so that's about a constant pressure point in Q4 in terms of our reset actions. And then just as I think about Q4, what's going on there specifically there are three things. One is that we have an Easter shift, which is a benefit of about an overall comp point in the fourth quarter. The two, other mitigating factors are wholesale timing shipments that we called out. That's worth about - that's about a pressure of - 1 to 2 comp points. And then what we called out is that, we are going to be less heavy into clearance. This fourth quarter, because we're not moving significant inventory goods into the clearance season. What you've seen is, we've raised our gross margin guidance and but it's slightly exceeding about a point of comp pressure in the fourth quarter. So those are the ongoing reset dynamics and then the specific dynamics to the fourth quarter. Patrice Louvet : Good. And then, Omar, good morning. On your digital questions, maybe let me break it down into kind of e-commerce and the brand building piece. So on the e-commerce, if you look at the three channels that we're approaching here. First of all, as far as our own site is concerned this past quarter was a reset quarter as we transition to the new platform continue to significantly reduce discounts. I don't know that we can draw any major conclusions yet from this past quarter. I think, we've got more learnings as things stabilize from the platform and discounting standpoint. As far as wholesale.com is concerned, we're actually really pleased with the progress we're making both here in North America and around the world, where we're seeing consumers respond really nicely to our presence online with our wholesale partners. As we mentioned, we're growing share and the share of that business for us is increasing as part of our total wholesale business is currently in the high-teens, I expect it to continue to grow. So very encourage there, I think, we've got nice momentum that we now need to continue to fuel. And I feel good about the partnership that we have with our key wholesale partners to drive that to leverage the consumer insights, to have joint marketing activities. The third piece is pure players, which is really honestly more or less new space for us as a company. We're more advanced in Europe and other parts of the world, but we're starting to ramp-up in Asia and here as well. And early indications are quite positive, so we're feeling very good about the consumer response we're getting on our pure play partnerships. So that's the commerce piece. Then as far as the brand building piece is concerned. We actually are seeing a number of things that give us confidence we're on the right track. We quoted in our prepared remarks, some data on how we're growing our user base or followership on Instagram. We're up 40% versus year-ago over the past year on Instagram with multimillion dollar increases. Our fan base on WeChat, obviously, China's important market for us, 50% of the past three months, so we're seeing good response and good momentum on these platforms. We started to experiment with Snapchat, which is - I think we all know on this call, appeals to a younger consumer. And the statistics on this one, we're actually pretty amazing. We achieved - so we ran a promoted story campaign around our Create-Your-Own initiative or personalization initiative. We did that the past quarter. I think one of the first brands actually to partner with Snapchat on native advertising. So we feel good about the fact that we're progressively getting into a leadership position in this space. And just a couple of data points here. We achieved 419 million impressions over that timeframe, and we had a very strong engagement 2 million swipe-ups, which is the Snapchat's version of a click, which based on what Snapchat is telling us, it's actually a very strong performance and all of that took our users into a direct e-commerce sites. So we are learning with new tools, we're making progress on existing digital platform, I think, we're encouraged by the progress. But as with everything we're doing, we know, we have more work to do, we really want to win with the broad group of consumers segments, we're targeting, obviously, millennials in part of that. We're encouraged by some recent data we've actually seen on the band penetration among millennials, and we're just continuing to drive that journey. And Omar, really in the learning more, right. I mean, I think, the mindset we have as a company here is, we want to become a digital-first company and you've seen some of the organizational changes that we've made to enable that. And we recognize that this is a very fast evolving landscape and that we need to constantly learn and really be in the leadership position in those spaces and platforms that matter most. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Ike Boruchow : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Ike. Ike Boruchow : You guys mentioned several times on the call regarding your off-price business. I guess, either Patrice or Jane, just could you maybe give us a little bit more color there. Maybe how much of that business plan to be down this fiscal year? Should those declines accelerate or maintain that rate into next fiscal year? Just trying to get a sense of maybe what your off-price penetration today is versus peak and really where you ultimately want that penetration to go. Jane Nielsen : Yeah. So as I look at the progress we've made to date, our off-price business is down in the mid-20% range. It's declining as a percent of penetration to our wholesale business. And we know that we want right now that trend, that penetration decline to continue into next year. I think, we'll discuss, as Patrice mentioned, more of the magnitude of that as we move into Investor Day, but we know we want this penetration into our whole - full price wholesale business to decline. And it's really about getting back in balance with the role of that channel. It has a very loyal large consumer base that loves to shop sort of the treasure hunt. And it can be a very powerful [indiscernible] for us to liquidate inventory. That's not where we're at today. But that is the role that we like the channel to play within our business, of course, our partners and we have to make that that inventory attractive for them to merchandise and sell, and make sure they don't have broken sizing. But that's really the balance that we like to get back in that channel. But good progress this year, we expect continued progress as we close out the year, and it's certainly one of our points of focus as we move forward into next year. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Lindsay. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Lindsay. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Jane, I wanted to just first clarify something that you had said in your prepared remarks, which I believe was that two-thirds of the decline, I think, in North American wholesale was related to deliberate actions. So does that imply that, excluding your deliberate actions that business is running - has been running down around in the mid-single-digits, and then, as we think about North American operating profit for the region overall. At what point should we be looking for operating profit to stabilize before then kind of pivoting to growth, so is that an early fiscal 2019 event? It seems like with some of the things that you're beginning to lap. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yes, Lindsay. So you're exactly right. In terms of what we can measure in our North America wholesale, we know that brand exits, distribution exits, receipt pullback, coupled with lessening promotional levels and frequencies are accounting for about two-third of the decline. The remainder gets us to sort of an underlying trend of about mid-single-digit decline in our full price wholesale business. And that's based on traffic. And right now we're targeting gaining share as we move forward in that channel, knowing that there is - there are some secular challenges in that channel. In terms of North American operating margin, we do expect as we come out of these deliberate and intentional pullback that we'll see improved top-line trends. And of course, in June we'll give you more specifics in terms of our expectations on overall operating margin and specifically for what we expect by country. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Company. You may ask your question. Rick Patel : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the progress. It sounds like you're accelerating focus on pure-play e-commerce sites here in the U.S. Can you share your thoughts on product segmentation? Maybe you can talk about your strategy in Europe if that's a good roadmap. I'm just curious that as we think about the U.S. in the coming quarters, are your new pure-play partners going to have access to the same products as department stores do today or will that product be differentiated? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : So you're right. We are accelerating our focus on pure-plays around the world and probably North America is the region where we are least developed, so where the - where we have the greatest opportunity. We are going to approach the overall product lineup with a very broad lens, because we have presence across multiple segments including home. Right, so you've probably seen us enter One Kings Lane. We're actually encouraged by the early results on that. So broad - that's a broad portfolio. We are keen to make sure we have the right level of differentiation across channels. So we are catering to the specific consumer that's shopping in that specific channel. So we'll have the balance of common products across channels and differentiated offerings. But that's not just true for pure-players. That's also true for the way we approach our factory outlets and the way we approach our own stores relative to wholesale. Evren Kopelman : Okay. We'll take one last question, please. Operator : The last question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks, good morning. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Erinn. Erinn Murphy : I guess, I got a question for - on the North American outlet business, can you just talk about, from a traffic perspective, how that trended during the holiday quarter. And then just with the stronger euro, are you seeing a return to tourism yet here in the United States. And then, I guess, Patrice, for you on China. If you deepen your growth efforts in this market, where is brand awareness, just remind us from an aided or an unaided perspective today. Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Erinn, let me just start with the North America outlet trends and what we're seeing in traffic. We're still seeing - for the third quarter, we saw traffic declines. Although, no real significant change to what we've been seeing in the previous quarters. And then, overall, we were really proud in our North America outlet stores that we saw greater conversion with - even though we were less promotional and had less discount rates in our North America stores and that's what drove a portion of the outperformance that we saw in North America outlet, so really a tribute to the team. Traffic relatively stable, and still slightly down mid-single-digit. As you look at foreign tourists, what we did see in this quarter was that our foreign tourist traffic was - in North America specifically was down. It was down in that high-single-digit range, where we had come off this second quarter and saw foreign tourist traffic down low-single-digits. So foreign tourist traffic was more challenged in the third quarter than in the second quarter and a little bit better than what we saw in the third quarter of last year. Patrice Louvet : And as we talk China and brand awareness, so actually we've been surprised by the high level of brand awareness in China given, honestly, our limited store footprint and limited e-commerce presence until recently. We've just completed a pretty broad global analysis actually on where the brand stands. So we'll follow-up with you on the specific number. But if I remember correctly, we're in the 70s in terms of brand awareness, relative to 90% in the U.S. So there is still a 20% gap for - relative to the market like the U.S., UK or Japan where we've obviously been for a much, much longer time. But I think a good starting point to drive the growth of business. And obviously, as we increase our investments, as we increase our activities with influencers, as we increase our overall presence there, we're quite confident that we can get that number up significantly. Patrice Louvet : Okay, very good. Listen, we're going to call it a day. Thank you, all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you in our next call in May. And then, importantly, we look forward to seeing many of you in our Investor Day on June 7 in New York City. So please capture that date in your calendars. And at that point, we'll be in a position to share our perspective, not only on fiscal year 2019, but also how we see the roadmap for the company over the following years. So thanks for calling in and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mrs. Evren Kopelman. Please go ahead. Evren Kopelman : Thank you for joining Ralph Lauren fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today\u2019s call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Evren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. We\u2019re pleased to report fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 results that delivered on our commitments. Revenue was ahead of our expectations, driven by a solid fourth quarter and operating margin was at the high-end of our plan for both the quarter and the year. We\u2019re on a journey to establish a healthy foundation to get the company back to sustainable long-term growth and value creation. In fiscal 2018, we made strong progress on this journey, as we executed on our key strategic initiatives and closed the year with a clear game plan, a strong balance sheet and an engaged team focused on executing with excellence. We look forward to sharing our long-term growth and value-creation strategy and financial outlook at our Investor Day on June 7. Before we review our recent progress, Ralph and I would like to welcome our new Board members : Mike George, who joined the Board last week; and Angela Ahrendts, who has agreed to join us in August. We\u2019re excited about the new capabilities and experiences they will each bring to our Board. Angela needs little introduction. From her time successfully leading Burberry as CEO to the work she is doing transforming Apple\u2019s retail arm, she will bring invaluable perspective and experience to bear as we move through our own transformation. Mike, who is CEO of Qurate, the parent company of QVC, HSN, zulily and others, brings deep experience in driving growth and value creation through very unique and evolving retail channels globally. Now let me take you through the progress we\u2019ve made in fiscal 2018 across our four key initiatives, which include : first, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product; second, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers; third, expanding our digital and international presence; and fourth, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. I will focus most of my commentary on full-year fiscal 2018 results and Jane will cover more of the fourth quarter performance. So starting with the first initiative, elevating our brand by improving quality of sales, distribution and product. In fiscal 2018, we drove growth in our average unit retail through discount rate reductions and sales mix. AUR was up 4% across our direct-to-consumer network with growth in every quarter and in every region. We improved the quality of our distribution by continuing to close lower productivity and off-equity doors in both retail and wholesale. In fiscal 2018, we closed approximately 25% of our U.S. department store points of distribution and 31 directly operated retail stores. While these closures are largely complete, we will continue to progressively reduce our penetration in the off-price channel. However, the negative impacts from the off-price reduction to our sales performance will not be as significant going forward as it was in fiscal 2018. At the same time, we\u2019re expanding our store network, especially in international markets, where we are underpenetrated with new small-format stores that are highly productive. Combined, these actions are repositioning our overall store base to deliver high-quality future sales growth. All of these actions led to strong adjusted gross margin improvement of 290 basis points for the year with solid increases every quarter. Moving on to our second key initiative, evolving our product, marketing and shopping experience to increase our reach and appeal with new consumers. In each of these areas, we\u2019re focused on combining Ralph\u2019s and our creative team\u2019s iconic brand vision with deep insight and understanding of consumers around the world. Starting with products. We continue to drive assortment discipline with improvements in the clarity of our product message and SKU productivity. For fiscal 2018, revenue per SKU increased 16% and gross profit per SKU was up 22% to last year. Our spring season-to-date performance continued the improvement in trends we experienced during fall and holiday. We saw product successes in our core items, where we brought newness and excitement through the addition of novelty, like embroidery and printing, as well as refreshed fabrics and increased functionality. Polo led our brand sales performance. Our best sellers included a modernized version of our men\u2019s Polo sweatshirt featuring a technology-infused double-knit fabric. We also had good sell-through with our updated take on our Classic Oxford shirt with a garment died fabrication, representing a fresh interpretation. Outerwear was another positive area, where lighter weight and functional fabrics in both casual weekend and Wear To Work styles drove growth. In addition, our new read and react graphic T-shirt program was effective with a quick turnaround from consumer test to shop floor. In women\u2019s Polo, details like souvenir embroidery on our iconic military jacket added interest. And in Lauren, our sweater jackets, where we added multiple silhouettes and button options, were bestsellers. We also built on our limited edition successes in the fourth quarter with the launch of our Snow Beach collection in January, which draws on our deep and authentic heritage. The original Snow Beach collection was introduced in 1993, and many pieces became iconic collector\u2019s items. Similar to our successful Stadium launch last September, Snow Beach sold out within hours and helped to drive excitement around our brand. Lastly, in product, we also continued to make progress on building out underdeveloped categories that have significant growth potential across our brands. Last quarter, we talked about denim as one of these categories, where our consumer research showed that we have a clear basis to win. Our sales in denim were up 9% for the year and 13% for the fourth quarter, driven by updated fits, washes and lighter-weight fabrications. So, as you can see, we\u2019re making encouraging progress across multiple fronts on product and we\u2019re pleased with the improving consumer response that we are seeing. Moving on to marketing. In fiscal 2018, we significantly increased our marketing investment in campaigns and assets with strong potential to better align our spend with the industry norm. Marketing spend was up 10% for the full fiscal year to $241 million. This growth was driven by increases in digital and social media, as we shift marketing investment to the channels that matter most to our consumers today. One of the key elements of our marketing strategy is adopting a more consumer-centric approach. We recently completed a major global consumer research study that provided important insights that we\u2019ll share with you at Investor Day in a couple of weeks. These learnings will enable us to be much more precise about how we engage specific consumer groups in order to make our marketing investments more effective and efficient. We had several major marketing events in the fourth quarter that drove significant consumer engagements for the brand. Starting with our sponsorship of the Winter Olympics. We generated 6 billion media impressions from extensive social media presence with key American athletes and outfitting the U.S. Olympic Team with the high-tech heated jacket. Our February fashion show was a successful media event with 3.2 million global live views. We built anticipation and amplification on social with 3.3 billion global media impressions. The Snow Beach limited edition in January successfully leveraged social media through a robust campaign on Instagram and key influencers such as Chance the Rapper and Zayn. And lastly, our spring Polo campaign featuring our iconic white Polo shirt was integrated across various touchpoints, from Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat to ralphlauren.com and our stores. We\u2019ll be able to share more perspective on this campaign on our next earnings call. We also continued to build our influencer and celebrity coverage, spanning various parts of culture from artists to movie stars to athletes. Awards season dressing included Shailene Woodley at the Golden Globes, Emma Watson and Eiza Gonzales at the Academy Awards, Jay-Z at the Grammy Awards Pre-Party and Mandy Moore and Yara Shahidi at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. In sports, Polo ambassador and current number 1 golfer in the world, Justin Thomas, and Olympic athletes, including the Shibutani siblings represented our brand in the athletic arena. Internationally, we continued to partner with celebrities and other key social media influencers, including Gloria Tang and Wenwen Han in China, Jessica Jung in Korea and Akira in Japan in the fourth quarter. This diverse group of influencers represents different aspects of our brand and engages different consumer segments. Finally, in terms of upgrading our shopping experience, both in stores and online, we invested in our store environments around the world. For example, in North America, we refreshed over 80 of our top department store shops in fiscal 2018 through improved fixturing, lightning, visual merchandising, product presentation and layout. The new environment is updated with a fresh, lighter aesthetic with improved product presentation focused on our core items, as well as growth categories like denim. The refreshed shops also enable easier navigation for consumers and provide a more coherent brand experience. This has driven improved sales and margin versus control doors and pretest trends. We plan to accelerate and broaden these activities in fiscal 2019 across all channels globally. Moving on to our third key initiative, expanding our digital and international presence. On the last two earnings calls, I spoke in detail about our growth opportunity in Asia, specifically in China, as well our expansion in digital commerce. Let me give you an update on both of those areas. China had a great year in fiscal 2018, posting 25% sales growth on the mainland. Our new small format stores, a key component of our omni-channel growth strategy in the region are performing well. We ended the year with 111 directly operated stores and concessions in Greater China, representing a net increase of 28 versus prior year. This is complemented by our strong digital expansion in China on Tmall, JD.com and WeChat. We remain on track to reach our goal of $0.5 billion of revenue in five years in Greater China, especially as we continue to raise our brand awareness and perception. Moving on to digital, which is a critical piece of our global growth strategy. In fiscal 2018, our global digital ecosystem sales were approximately $1 billion at retail value, including both our partners and our directly operated businesses. In fiscal 2019 and beyond, we expect our digital growth to accelerate as the major pullback in our directly operated North America e-commerce business is largely complete. We\u2019re improving our site\u2019s functionality and increasing marketing to return to revenue growth in this important channel. In the first quarter, we will be upgrading the technology platform for our directly operated European e-commerce business, similar to what we implemented in North America last fall. We expect this transition will significantly improve the shopping experience on our site with enhanced functionality, including better search, navigation and checkout process. Our digital wholesale business continues to grow. In fiscal 2018, we drove market share gains in this channel at our key retailers and in our key categories. We are collaborating closely with our key partners on targeted product and marketing initiatives on both department store websites and pure play customers. As an example, our collaboration with ASOS in Europe with the different ways to wear the polo shirt campaign was highly effective, as we tailored the message specifically for the consumer on that platform. Finally, let me touch on our fourth key initiative, working in new ways to drive productivity and agility. In fiscal 2018, we made significant progress across many areas. Let me start with our major end-to-end initiative, designed to drive productivity across the business, including inventory efficiencies and faster lead times. Our work in this area has resulted in a 30% reduction in inventory over the past couple of years and we achieved our goal of having 90% of our products on a nine-month lead time at the end of fiscal 2018. This is enabling us to make product decisions much closer to consumer demand. We plan to drive further improvements in fiscal 2019 towards six-month and three-month lead times for a certain portion of our products. We\u2019ll talk about that and more of our important initiatives in this area at our upcoming Investor Day. So in closing, over the last fiscal year, we have made strong progress as we continue to execute our key initiatives to position the company to get back to sustainable long-term growth and value creation. Ralph and I are proud of the work our teams around the world have done this year. We\u2019re encouraged by the way our teams are coming together to focus on the consumer, prioritize what matters most and move with urgency to get us back to winning. I look forward to discussing our more detailed strategic plan with you in a couple of weeks. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jane, and I\u2019ll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full-year results were ahead of our expectations and showed continued progress on resetting the business to a healthier base. Our four key initiatives are delivering higher AURs, lower discounts, expanded gross margins, higher inventory turns and significant growth in free cash flow. Fourth quarter revenues declined 2% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. This was above our guidance, driven largely by a strong Easter holiday in retail. With the holiday momentum, we returned to comp growth in North American stores. During this quarter and throughout this fiscal year, our teams have focused on strengthening the brand and driving strong execution. I\u2019m so proud of the progress we\u2019ve made and the work they continue to do. In the quarter, we saw higher sell-throughs on spring and improved product profitability, notably in our Polo brand. Adjusted gross margin expanded 440 basis points in the fourth quarter and 350 basis points in constant currency, benefiting from the reduced discount rates and favorable geographic and channel mix. Lower product costs and product mix also provided a tailwind to gross margin in the fourth quarter. While quality of sales initiatives will continue to drive overall gross margin expansion in fiscal 2019, product cost will become more challenging in the coming year. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 5.6%, down 110 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 240 basis points in constant currency, at the top-end of our guidance. In the fourth quarter, we stepped up our marketing significantly off a low base last year. Planned investment in marketing was up more than 50% in the fourth quarter and up 10% for the year and contributed to the improvement we saw in our sales trend. Moving forward, our goal is to progressively increase marketing investment to accelerate our top line growth. However, our objective is to fund the majority of the increases through productivity gains to achieve operating margin expansion. Moving on to our segment performance. Starting with North America, revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter and comps were flat in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was flat to last year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased marketing investment. Importantly, all channels contributed to gross margin improvements in the fourth quarter. Let me review the North America results across channels, first, our stores; second, our directly operated e-commerce business; and third, our wholesale business. Our stores were a highlight with a 6% positive comp in the quarter, driven by improved AUR and traffic trends ahead of our expectations. The earlier timing of Easter contributed 3.5 points to North America comp in the fourth quarter and 1.5 points to total company global comp. Our retail improvements demonstrate some of the progress we have made across product, marketing and operational initiatives, such as monthly product newness and timing of floor sets that were better aligned with customers wear now shopping preferences. At a more macro level, we also saw growth in foreign tourist sales in the fourth quarter, following 15 consecutive quarters of declines. E-commerce comps in North America were down 18% in the fourth quarter in line with our expectations. E-commerce results continue to be pressured by our deliberate quality of sales initiatives, including significant reductions and deep markdowns. This quarter, we continued the work to lower discount rates and promotion frequency. Additionally, new arrivals and most of our iconic items were excluded from promotions. We expect to return to growth in North America e-commerce in fiscal 2019. This will be driven by three factors. First, the significant pullback in deep markdown sales is substantially complete and fiscal 2019 quality of sales efforts will be more moderated. Second, we are elevating our assortment and adding conversion-driving functionality to the site, such as customer reviews and live chat, all accompanied by better story-telling and creative. Third, in fiscal 2018, full price sales, which were not impacted by our promotional pull back, were up 3% with continued strengthening in the fourth quarter. This momentum gives us confidence that we can return to growth as the impact of the pullback diminishes. Moving on to North America wholesale. The fourth quarter revenue decline of 22% reflects strategic actions, timing shifts and negative, but improving sellout. Two-thirds of the decline is a continuation of our quality of sales initiatives, reductions at Bon-Ton and off-price timing shifts. Similar to prior quarters, closures of lower productivity points-of-sale in department stores, brand exits and reduced discounts negatively impacted revenue. Reduced shipments to Bon-Ton stores of approximately $10 million versus last year also created pressure. Finally, a shift in timing of off-price shipments negatively impacted the trend. Off-price revenue was down 29% in the fourth quarter versus an 18% decline in the third quarter. Some Q4 shipments that typically occur late in the quarter shifted into Q1. The remaining one-third was related to our underlying trends. While we are seeing improvements in our apparel categories, some of our progress was offset by weakness in non-apparel categories. As you know, our wholesale shipments reflect department store orders from almost a year ago. These orders followed a challenging spring 2017 collection sell-out that was down mid-teens. Since that time, sell-out has shown an improved trajectory. The fall holiday season was down low double digits and our current sell-out trend at department stores is down mid single digits. Clearly, we still have work to do, but the improved sell-out trends should be reflected in our orders and then on our P&L over the next several quarters. Looking out to fiscal 2019, we expect to see an improvement in our North America wholesale trend. While we expect revenue to decline, it should be at a smaller magnitude than in fiscal 2018. Some of the dynamics we see at play as we enter FY 2019 are, on a positive side, continued sell-out trend improvement, which will increasingly have the benefit of the refresh of our wholesale shop environments and evolved product and marketing; and growth in our digital wholesale business, which now represents a mid to high teens percent of our total wholesale revenue. While some pressures from FY 2018 remained, we expect them to lessen in magnitude. In off-price, we will continue to reduce shipments, but at a more moderate rate, as we restore balance to the channel as a vehicle for excess sales. The impact from our FY 2018 point-of-sale to closures will lessen as we anniversary those closures in FY 2019. Finally, the Bon-Ton bankruptcy, which represents about $25 million in fiscal 2018, represents about a 1.5 point of headwind to North America wholesale growth in fiscal 2019. In this channel, our focus remains to build high-quality growth with our partners in the North America wholesale channel. Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 13% on a reported basis and declined 1% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points, but were down 220 basis points in constant currency as gross margin improvements were offset by increased marketing investments. Wholesale revenue in Europe increased 1% in constant currency in the fourth quarter in line with the underlying trend of the business. Digital wholesale in Europe continued to post double-digit growth and expand market share. In the retail channel, European comps were down 6% in constant currency, with growth in e-commerce more than offset by declines in our stores. Comps in Europe continue to be pressured by our ongoing quality of sales initiatives, assortment and inventory challenges in outlet and challenging traffic, notably in some of our outlet stores. We are implementing a number of changes in our product assortments and promotion structures to improve the traffic and conversion trends in our European stores. We expect these initiatives will start impacting the business in the second-half of fiscal 2019. Also, as Patrice mentioned, we will be upgrading the technology platform for our digitally-operated European e-commerce business at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we expect this transition will negatively impact second quarter e-commerce comps in Europe. We will manage these impacts carefully to minimize disruption, similar to what we did in North America when we transitioned last fall. Despite challenging trends in our brick-and-mortar stores, progress in our KPIs continued. In the fourth quarter in Europe, average unit retails were up 3%, discount rates were down and gross margin was up 270 basis points on a reported basis and 40 basis points in constant currency. Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 17% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. We saw strong performance across every market in Asia, including 6% growth in Japan, 34% growth in mainland China and 22% growth in Greater China, all in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in the region and we are continuing to increase our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 4% in constant currency in the fourth quarter, continuing the positive comp trend from the first three quarters of the year. We expect further comp growth in Asia as we continue to upgrade our distribution network and marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. We also continued to drive quality of sales in Asia. In the fourth quarter, average unit retails were up 3%, discount rates were down and gross margin was up significantly. Adjusted operating margin was up 210 basis points to last year in the fourth quarter in Asia and up 80 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin improvement. With our quality of sales actions largely completed in Asia, we expect more modest operating margin expansion going forward, as we focus on driving top line growth and leveraging our investments. Turning to our store fleet. We continue to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. For the full-year, we opened 37 standalone stores and 77 concessions. We closed 31 standalone stores and 65 concessions, ending the year with 472 standalone stores and 632 concessions on a global basis. Moving on to the balance sheet. In this quarter and throughout this year, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, reflecting the operational progress we are making. We ended the year with $2.1 billion in cash and investments, up from $1.4 billion at the end of last year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $596 million, compared with $588 million last year. Inventory declined 7% in constant currency and 4% on a reported basis to $761 million at the end of the fiscal year. We will continue to focus on inventory productivity and matching inventory flows with demand. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 were $162 million, below our original plan, as we shifted certain capital investments from fiscal 2018 into 2019. We generated $814 million of free cash flow for the year, up from $669 million in the prior year period. Now I\u2019d like to turn to guidance for the full-year and first quarter of fiscal 2019. We will provide our long-term financial outlook, including our capital allocation strategy at our Investor Day on June 7. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges. For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect revenues to be down low single digits in constant currency, representing a sequential improvement in our journey to return to growth. Foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2019. We expect growth in our international business to be offset by a decline in North America, reflecting the timing of the Easter holidays, which will negatively impact both the first quarter and the fourth quarter, as well as the North America wholesale dynamics I outlined earlier. We expect operating margin for fiscal 2019 to be up slightly in constant currency. This will be driven by an estimated 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion, as we continue to reduce promotions and shift towards higher-margin channels and regions. Foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on operating margin in fiscal 2019. This guidance reflects a balance between continued quality of sales initiatives to elevate the brand and investments in products, marketing and store concepts that demonstrate high potential for growth and returns. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect revenue to be flat to down slightly in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to benefit revenue growth by approximately 150 to 200 basis points in the quarter. We expect global comp store sales in the first quarter to be negatively impacted by approximately 1.5 points, while North America comps to be negatively impacted by roughly 3 points from the timing of Easter, which favorably impacted the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect gross margin to expand 50 to 75 basis points in the first quarter in line with our expectations for full-year fiscal 2019. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is expected to be up slightly in constant currency. Foreign currency is estimated to benefit operating margin by 20 to 40 basis points in the quarter. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $275 million in fiscal 2019, focused on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof-of-concept and healthy rates of return, including stores, digital and marketing. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 22%, below our fiscal 2018 adjusted rate of 24%, primarily due to the lower U.S. federal income tax rate as a result of tax reform. First quarter of fiscal 2019 tax rate is estimated at approximately 18%. In closing, we continue to make strong progress in building the right foundation to grow our business. Ralph\u2019s enduring vision inspires our teams around the world and they are delivering on operational efficiencies and building our growth initiatives. We are seeing early signs of momentum. As one team, we are focused on delivering quality, sustainable growth and value creation for the long term. With that, let\u2019s open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking our question. Congrats on \u2013 I know you guys have been working hard on this. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Thanks, Michael. Michael Binetti : Yes, thanks. So can I just ask \u2013 in fiscal 2019, a lot of puts and takes there and, Jane, thanks for all the detail. Do you expect the revenue trend to improve as the year progresses, if we exclude a bunch of calendar shifts you pointed out, some puts and takes like Bon-Ton and the off-price reduction? And if I can just ask one follow-up in a bigger picture, Jane, you went through a lot of the distribution, you pulled back a really big amount. You hinted that sell-through is starting to improve. But on your last call, I think, you made a hint that your retailers are starting to see the margins on Ralph Lauren product improve on a year-over-year basis. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the first increase in years. Are you starting to see green shoots on the order book in any of the meaningful accounts at this point? Are they starting to increase orders, or is it better to characterize retail partners as still digesting a lot of the big changes over the last few years and you need to check a few boxes yet before we start new growth? Patrice Louvet : All right. Good morning, Michael. So I\u2019ll take the first part of your question and then Jane will cover your \u2013 the second part. Michael Binetti : Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Short answer is yes. We expect to see an improvement in our underlying business trend as we move through fiscal year 2019. However, on the face of the reported numbers, you\u2019re not going to really see a smooth sequential quarterly flow. And there are really three reasons that are going to make the quarterly flow a little choppy, if I can use that terminology. First one is the cadence of our wholesale shipments, right? Our strategic reduction in our off-price shipment this year are going to be more concentrated in the second-half of the fiscal year, so that\u2019s going to obviously pressure revenue in the back-half. And in addition, Q1 is actually benefiting from a shift in European wholesale as we normalize our shipment cadence after adjustments we made last year in that region. So that\u2019s the first one. The second one is the timing of Easter that we referred to in our remarks, right? The fourth quarter and the first quarter of fiscal 2019 are going to be negatively impacted by this Easter shift. And then the final one is foreign currency. So based on what we can assume today, we assume that FX will have a bigger benefit to reported revenue in the front-half of the fiscal year. Yes, but if you exclude the impact of the Easter shift, our strategic off-price reductions, you will see a meaningful improvement in our underlying business trends as we go through the year. Jane Nielsen : Yes, Michael, just on the second part of your question, I have two reasons to believe that our wholesale results are going to improve. One you called out is improved sell-out trends. So if I look a year ago to spring 2017, our sell-out was down mid-teens. As we move through holidays, we saw low double digits. And now in \u2013 our current sell-out is down in the mid-single-digit range, so strong progress there. Our overall full \u2013 natural margins at wholesalers have progressed to increase quarter-by-quarter, so we made great progress this year. On retailer profitability, as you can see, our profitability, as was reflected in the segment, has also improved, so it\u2019s been a win-win situation. And based on those sell-outs, the order books are going to be stronger as we move into 2019. So it takes a while, especially in wholesale, because you\u2019ve got to earn your way through. But I think, they\u2019re seeing the sell-out improvements. We\u2019ve gotten good feedback on the showrooms that we\u2019re showing. And importantly, we\u2019re both winning with following \u2013 coming out of our reset. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Brian Tunick : Great. Thanks, and I will add my congrats as well on the progress. Jane Nielsen : Thanks, Brian. Patrice Louvet : Thank you. Brian Tunick : I guess, my question may be for Jane. The gross margins here, I believe at an all-time high for the company. So maybe can you share with us, Jane or Patrice, your views on maybe where AURs can go from here as it seems like the worst of the inventory rationalization is behind us? And then maybe, Jane, give us some comfort on where our gross margins may be between different channels or geographies. As those grow faster, how do those differ versus the maybe North America business, so we can think about gross margins expanding even more? Thank you very much. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Let me try to take your question in pieces. First, on AUR. So where do I see AURs going? AURs are going to go higher and that\u2019s based on a number of dynamics, product elevation that we\u2019ve been working through this year and continue to work on, differentiated assortments by channels that allow for pricing harmonization and for us to provide value in different channels, as well as price harmony. We are assorting into higher price points, notably in international. The international consumer has a very strong view of the Ralph Lauren brand and we\u2019re going to take that opportunity to assort into higher price points. As we mix into international markets where our AURs are higher, notably in Asia, you will see some benefit also to the AUR as we get that mix. And of course, that\u2019s all balanced on a foundation of less promotions and less discounting as we move through the year. So that\u2019s the expectation that I see on AURs. As I look \u2013 step back from gross margin \u2013 to gross margins, we do see gross margin\u2019s expansion into the coming year. And that\u2019s driven largely on the back of what I just talked about higher AURs, less discounts and less promotions. That\u2019s been, as you look across these four quarters, the largest driver of our gross margin progression and that will continue to be the driver as we move forward. There is a benefit, as we \u2013 as I mentioned, as we move into international. That benefit on the gross margin line because of the higher AURs and the higher gross margins in international will be a net benefit as we move into next year. As you look between wholesale and retail globally, we have \u2013 we are at the highest retail gross margin as a company that we\u2019ve seen. But we believe we have progress to move further, especially as we build out these smaller-format doors that carry a nice \u2013 very nice gross margins across Asia, but across all of our markets, so that\u2019s a net benefit. And then wholesale, we made a lot of good progress and we\u2019re at our highest total wholesale gross margins that we\u2019ve been at in five years. But with the progress we\u2019re making with assortment and differentiated assortment and the pullback in off-price, we see more room there as well. I think that we are comfortable that gross margin will expand, not at the pace that you\u2019ve seen it in this last year, but as a durable benefit as we move forward. Evren Kopelman : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my congrats. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Ike. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Ike. Ike Boruchow : I guess \u2013 so I guess, Jane, I wanted to dig into the North America e-comm channel a little bit. It sounds like you expect North America e-comm, if I heard right, to grow next fiscal year. I guess, my question is should that growth begin immediately starting in Q1? Is that more of a 2H inflection? And then just a quick follow-up to that, now that you\u2019ve kind of rebased that channel, can you just remind us what percent of sales, I think you used to say, we\u2019re on discount, I think it was 78% like two years ago, where that got down to today, now that you feel it\u2019s kind of rebased, just out of curiosity. Jane Nielsen : Sure. So first of all, on digital, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of hearing me say this, we\u2019re going to make, like all things, nothing happens when you turn the page of a calendar or a fiscal year. But we are going to make sequential progress on our digital business and we\u2019re encouraged by the early signs that we\u2019re seeing on digital. So it\u2019s not a flip, but it will be a sequential progress story as we look into FY 2019. And where we\u2019re really pleased in our digital business in terms of the amount of products sold on promotion is that, overall, what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019d really pull down the highest markdowns of 50% off or greater. We\u2019ve seen that penetrate far less in our assortment and we\u2019ve seen full price selling, most importantly, that wasn\u2019t affected by any promotion be up 3% this year and move strongly through the year. So that we ended the fourth quarter with full price selling up over double digits. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Co. Rick Patel : Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the progress. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts here, so good execution. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Rick Patel : You had a nice return to positive comps in North America stores. I\u2019m hoping you can give us a little more detail in terms of products and categories where you had the strongest performance, and your thoughts on the sustainability of that positive momentum in the New Year? And if I tie that into your comment about sequential improvement in e-commerce, should we expect to see retail comps turn positive this year? Patrice Louvet : Let\u2019s tag team, Jane and I, on this one. First, looking at the progress that drove \u2013 the drivers behind the progress in our comp. It\u2019s really the game plan that we\u2019ve laid out starting to deliver. So the elevation of the brand that we are doing through product, through quality of sales. And then as you look at the work we\u2019re doing on marketing and on specific product categories, whether that\u2019s denim, you heard earlier examples of outerwear in our prepared remarks, the combination of those high-growth categories and our stronger penetration of those has been key drivers behind the improvement of the comp performance that we\u2019re seeing. And we expect to continue the effort, both in terms of elevating the brand and evolving the product and the marketing. I also \u2013 although it\u2019s very hard to trace it to every \u2013 to a single activity, I think, the shift that we\u2019re making from a marketing standpoint towards more digital, towards more social and the numbers really continue to bear this out is having an impact on traffic, is having an impact on the brand perception, and this is therefore, driving this improvement that we\u2019re seeing. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Rick, as I look at the components, really the two drivers of North America comp were strong AUR growth, which you\u2019d expect given our quality of sales initiatives and improved traffic trends across all our channels. Now what we are seeing in contrast to Europe is, we saw a meaningful pickup in foreign tourist traffic. So it was up 7% this quarter and it was down about 7% last quarter. So a meaningful shift in traffic. We try to be clear, this was a holiday quarter. So, in North America, about 3.5 points with a benefit to North America comp, comp positive despite the holidays, so that\u2019s very encouraging. It will sit on Q1 and the holiday will sit on Q4. But as we move forward, we expect to be sort of flat to down low single digits comp in FY 2019. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Hey, thanks, It\u2019s great to see the continued progress, congrats on that. Patrice Louvet : Thanks, Omar. Omar Saad : Can you talk about \u2013 your inventory levels, quality of sales initiatives obviously have been having an impact on the P&L. Can you talk a little bit more about how you are managing inventory differently as more of your business has moved online across channels? Are you being able to develop kind of internal tech, IT systems that allow you to do more with less on the inventory side? Is that something we should think about as a medium and longer-term driver as well, or was it really just a matter of planning the right amount of inventory, reducing the promotions, and we\u2019ve kind of done most of the work around inventory already? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Thanks, Omar. So I guess, a couple of things on this one. One, there is just continued good old basic discipline that we will \u2013 we have in place that we\u2019re going to continue to drive to make sure that we are as efficient as possible. During Investor Day, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll attend, we\u2019ll give you some more perspective on some of the shifts we\u2019re making in terms of managing inventory, particularly across channels, where it was historically been relatively siloed in the way we\u2019ve managed inventory. And I think we\u2019ve got some exciting projects to leverage that more smartly across channels. So you\u2019ll see us continue to make progress on this area. Jane Nielsen : Yes, and we\u2019ll talk about it more at Investor Day. I would say that the work that our supply chain leader, Halide Alag\u00f6z and Val\u00e9rie Hermann, have done to have a very strong and integrated planning process from sketch to shelf has been a huge benefit to our inventory management. Good old-fashioned SKU cutting that were of unproductive SKUs was also a benefit and now we\u2019re evolving more into differentiated SKUs to support our overall AURs. And we are using technology like our RFID technology in the factory store, as well as shared inventory across channel to improve our inventory work. I would expect longer-term that our objective is to have the improved turns more moderately than we have with the inventory reset that we did to return to improved turns. But really, you\u2019ll see inventory match our sales outlook. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Robert Drbul : Hi, good morning. I just had a question on the North American wholesale business where you talked about refreshing 80 of the top department stores. Can you talk about the performance of those 80? Are there more that you are doing? And are you recapturing any square footage space in any of those top department stores? Can you give us an update on that? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So let\u2019s break down the different elements here. The first 80, we\u2019re really focusing on improving the environment, right? Some of these doors have not been touched for many, many years, some more than a decade. So it\u2019s about creating a more inviting, more engaging, more modern environment for consumers. This ranges from the lighting, ranges from fixturing that we have and also allocating the product categories in a way that really is more consistent with the way the consumers approach our business and want to shop us. We have seen strong lifts beyond, I mean, in these 80 doors relative to pretest period or \u2013 and/or benchmark doors. So view this as just the beginning for us, right? Ultimately, our goal over the next few years is really to impact the vast majority of our presence. So we will continue to do that and not just in wholesale, but really, our approach is to make sure we\u2019re transforming the shopping experience across every single channel that is relevant for a consumer target. And so that\u2019s true online, that\u2019s true in our own stores, that\u2019s true in our factory stores and that also continues in wholesale, both in North America and globally. As far as \u2013 second part of the question was? Jane Nielsen : Can you remind us, Bob, the second part? Robert Drbul : Just around like the square footage\u2026 Patrice Louvet : There is more space. Square footage Robert Drbul : Yes. Patrice Louvet : So that\u2019s \u2013 honestly, that\u2019s not the focus for us at this point. We want to be a lot more efficient with the space that we have. And so this is really about productivity per square foot as opposed to just adding more space. What we\u2019re finding actually, in some areas, we potentially have excess space relative to what we need to present the brand appropriately. So we\u2019re really focusing on the productivity of the space we have and making that work much harder for us. And we\u2019re actually seeing significant benefits, both in wholesale and in the stores that we\u2019ve renovated behind that approach. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Bob, I would just add that one of the benefits of that we\u2019re seeing in wholesale channel following the closure of the unproductive point-of-sales, as well as refurbishments that we are seeing our GMROI and our sales per square foot in wholesale increase nicely even in the face of overall shipment declines. So the GMROI of our strategy is working for us and it\u2019s working for our retailers. And in some cases, the resets actually have gone through a period of pullback, it helps you stake your claim to the space that you want and assort it more productively and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re doing. Evren Kopelman : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research. Eric Tracy : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and I\u2019ll add my congrats on great execution. Jane Nielsen : Thanks, Eric. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Eric. Eric Tracy : I\u2019ve got a two-parter here. It\u2019s a little bit distinct. But just first, maybe speak to continued marketing spend and demand creation levels that we should anticipate as we move into \u2013 throughout 2019. I think, Jane, you set up 10% this year. Maybe just again, sort of both quantify and give a level of assessment where that spend will go? And then secondly, Jane, you mentioned product costs in terms of gross margin not being as beneficial this year. Clearly, we\u2019ve got some inflationary pressures. Maybe just talk through that dynamic and the potential impact as well? Patrice Louvet : Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the marketing spend, Eric. So right now, our spend is around 4% of sales, right? The industry norm is closer to 5%. So over time, our goal is to get to minimum, the industry norm, because we believe in branding, we have an amazing brand, we need to invest behind it. We\u2019ve made good progress over the back-half of this past fiscal year, as we want to continue to drive that. And I think you can expect that we will increase similar growth rate in fiscal 2019 relative to the overall increase in fiscal year 2018. With a deliberate focus again on digital and social commerce, that\u2019s where the vast \u2013 and social media, that\u2019s where the vast majority of our marketing increases will go. Jane Nielsen : So as I look at product cost, Eric, the pressure points are, I\u2019d say, twofold. One is in actual garment, cost of polyester, cotton and even labor wage rates. And then the other factor that we\u2019re looking at is obviously freight cost and trucking capacity. As I aggregate those factors, I think that it\u2019s about 30 to 50 basis points of pressure on gross margin. Now as I contrast that to what happened in FY 2018, it was about 50 basis points of benefit. So we obviously are looking at cost management \u2013 cost initiative, renegotiating some deals and leveraging scale with our supply partners and managing duty costs. Those are all parts of our ongoing productivity initiatives to manage this cost to that 30 to 50 basis points. We\u2019ll also \u2013 a part of our AUR journey is to make sure that we cover structural cost increases with pricing increases. So I think we have a handle on it. It is a factor and it\u2019s one of the factors that will make gross margin expansion next year, but at a less significant rate than we saw in FY 2018. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Simeon Siegel : Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the progress. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Simeon. Simeon Siegel : Jane, sorry if I missed it. The CapEx has been coming down nicely and below plan in the past couple of years. I think, it looks like you\u2019re planning it back up this year. So any thoughts on what that should look like go forward? I don\u2019t know if there was anything timing-wise in there? And then just to your comment about the meaningful decline in off-price shipments in the control there, could you just remind us what the current off-price penetration is and where you\u2019d expect that to go? Patrice Louvet : Sure, Simeon. Let me give you some context on capital. Obviously, FY 2018, we spent less than we thought we would at $162 million. But I really view this as a test-and-learn year. So we put a lot of test into the marketplace, but we have a stringent guideline for the ROI that we need to see from investments that we put in the marketplace. That caused us to delay some initiatives into 2019, and so you\u2019re seeing that, in our CapEx guidance, it\u2019s closer to about 4.5% of sales as we move forward. Over the long-term, we think that 4.5% to 5%, 4% to 5% is the right level of CapEx for our business. As I look at CapEx, especially this year, if you contrast it to the last several years, like many others, significant CapEx investments in IT have moved into SG&A as we take advantage of more variable platforms like Demandware or Salesforce eCommerce Cloud, backup services that you don\u2019t have to invest capital in, but you pay as a service and stay technologically upgraded. So that\u2019s a factor for CapEx as we move forward. But I think, we feel good that we have really inculcated a strong ROI culture. We know where we need to go and we\u2019ll talk about it much more at Investor Day. Then, obviously, on off-price, we don\u2019t disclose the percentage of that business to our total. As you know, we would disclose it if it was more than 10% as a very high watermark. But our objective is to increase this channel\u2019s penetration into our wholesale channel, so it will be decreasing... Patrice Louvet : Increasing, increasing. Jane Nielsen : I\u2019m sorry. Oh, gosh. Patrice Louvet : We are increasing instead of \u2013 don\u2019t let anyone else hear that. We are decreasing its penetration to the wholesale channel. So it is a point of pressure to growth obviously in 2018 and into the future, not as dramatic as you saw in 2018, but at decreasing penetration. It\u2019s a pressure point in growth, because we\u2019ve got to get this channel back to where it should be strategically for us, which is in a point of excess sale for excess that we generate as a retailer. Evren Kopelman : Okay. We\u2019ll take one last question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is open. John Kernan : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the progress and looking forward\u2026. Patrice Louvet : John, good morning. John Kernan : Looking forward to the Investor Day. Jane, just wondering if you could touch on what\u2019s implied within the guidance for Europe and Asia this year on a revenue perspective? And then you\u2019ve obviously done a lot to elevate and enhance the brand, not just in North America, but globally. Can you talk about the potential you see in Europe and Asia? I think you talked about $500 million in China. Give us a little more detail now about what \u2013 where you see those businesses going in the future. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yes. And I can tell you, John, we\u2019re going to talk a lot more about this at Investor Day, and you can hear it directly from our leaders, Jeff Kuster and Howard Smith, who will give you perspective. In general, next year, I expect that international will grow and North America will decline less \u2013 in less magnitude than we saw this year, reflecting the work that we\u2019ve done, but that\u2019s our expectation. As I look across the international business, we know we are underpenetrated in China. Our store presence has a lot of opportunity. The Chinese consumer in the research that we\u2019ve done has an elevated perception of the brand. And we\u2019ve got a lot of room to grow into their perception, both in our assortments and in our stores, building out our stores. Across Europe, again, we have 19 full-price stores in Europe. We have a great opportunity to grow there. Notably, we\u2019re underpenetrated in Germany and Italy as opportunity areas, where we have a strong consumer perceptions and relatively limited build-out of our store fleet, but those are the opportunity areas. Patrice Louvet : Yes. I think we\u2019re excited about the growth opportunities we have in international and we will share those in more detail in a couple of weeks. So listen, we\u2019re going to close it here. Thank you for joining the call. We look forward to seeing all of you June 7 on the Investor Day and have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Evren. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We're pleased to report first quarter fiscal 2019 results that reflect progress on our next great chapter's strategic growth plan that we shared with you at our investor day, in June. We're encouraged by this start to the new fiscal year, as first quarter results showed improvement in both the top and bottom line. A few of our team's key achievements this quarter included high single-digit growth in our average unit retail globally, double-digit growth in Asia, our key growth region, and digital commerce up high single digits. This solid start enables us to modestly improve our outlook for the year. Our long-term plan is based on our three guiding principles, first to put the consumer at the center of everything we do. Second, to elevate and energize our brands, and third, to balance growth and productivity. With these principles in mind we are focused on executing our five key strategies. First, win over a new generation of consumers. Second, energize core products and accelerate high-value underdeveloped categories. Third, drive targeted expansion in all regions and channels. Fourth, lead with digital across all activities. And fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. Let me take you through the progress we've made in the first quarter across these initiatives, starting with the first one, win over a new generation of consumers. Our goal is to recruit millions of new consumers into our brand each year. To achieve that we're continuing to increase our marketing investment and shift our spend to digital channels that matter most to consumers today. In the first quarter, we increased our marketing spend by about 20% to last year. Our primary communication was our Spring Polo campaign featuring our iconic white Polo shirt. We told our brand's story in a fresh way that drove results. Sales of our Polo shirts in the first quarter outpaced our overall revenue trend, and were up double digits in men's. We also continue to drive interest and excitement among our target consumers through limited additional launches. In the first quarter, we continue to leverage our iconic heritage and deep archives to launch CP93. This collection originally launched in 1993 and celebrated the America's Cup sailing race. Marketing communication utilized both archival assets and a newly shot campaign to celebrate the heritage, while generating new excitement for the updated capsule collection. The collection performed well with many styles selling out within days. We also continue to leverage the power of cultural events and influencers. This came to life recently at Wimbledon at the end of the first quarter. As the official outfitter of the event, we amplified our sponsorship and increased our reach on digital and social media through celebrity dressing and events with influencers. For example, British actress, Poppy Delevingne, took over Polo's Instagram stories and shared her stylish take on Wimbledon. Other celebrities including Emma Watson, Gemma Chan, Luke Evans, Eddie Redmayne, Eason Chan, F4, and Coco Lee, all wore Polo to the event. We generated over six billion total impressions globally from extensive social media presence. As we said at our investor day, our influencer and celebrity strategy spans various parts of culture, from artists, to movie starts, to athletes. This diverse group of influencers represents different aspects of our brand and engages different consumer segments. In the world of sports, we renewed our sponsorship agreement with top professional golfer, Justin Thomas, who will continue to serve as brand ambassador or Polo Golf. And we also launched a new RLX collaboration with Billy Horschel. In the entertainment world, at the Met Gala, in May, in New York several celebrities were dressed in our brand, including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Lily Aldridge, Priyanka Chopra, Kerry Washington, Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Jimmy Fallon. Our spring '18 Purple Label campaign featured Japanese actor and pop star Akira across a combination of digital, print, and outdoor media. Now, moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high-value underdeveloped categories. In our five-year plan, we expect half of our growth will come from core product categories, with the other half driven by high-value underpenetrated categories. We believe the key to energizing the core and driving a differentiated point of view in the marketplace is to combine Ralph and our creative team's iconic brand vision with deep insight and understanding of consumers around the world. This approach is gaining traction as our renewed core styles and icons drove a sequential improvement in our sellout trend in key categories for the spring-summer season. Performance was led by our Polo brand in both men and women's. We saw product successes in our core items where we brought newness and interest through the addition of novelty like embroidery, print, and color blocking as well as refreshed fabrics and increased functionality. Within our core, strong categories in men's included Polo shirts, woven shirts in both our oxford fabric and the newly-introduced natural stretch poplin, and our new chino pants with stretch fabrications. In women's Polo, dresses are trending well with consumers responding to our long shirt dresses in a number of different styles. Customization also continued to help energize our core product offerings. We had a popup custom shop at Wimbledon that offered exclusive prints as part of our Wimbledon capsule collection which sold through very well. In addition, our new small format store in Beverly Center in the Los Angeles market has a successful create-your-own shop that already represents approximately 10% of the store's sales. We also made progress on building out underdeveloped categories that has significant growth potential across all brands. These include denim, wear to work, auto wear, footwear, and accessories. Starting with denim, a fabrication that is core to our brand and where consumers have told us they expect us to play. Building off of the strong momentum of fiscal year '18, our sales in denim were up mid single digits in the first quarter, outpacing total company revenue growth. We saw traction in all channels of distribution with updated fits, washes, and lighter weight fabrications in both men's and women's. Auto wear was another strong category where lighter weight and functional fabrics in both casual weekend and wear-to-work styles for spring-summer drove growth. First quarter auto wear sales were up high single digits year-over-year across our brands. Our improved merchandizing is driving full-price sell-through and lower discounts. In the first quarter average unit retail was up 8% across our direct-to-consumer network. We're making encouraging progress across multiple fronts on product. And we are pleased with the improving consumer response that we're seeing. Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in all regions and channels. We're focused on building a compelling and competitive ecosystem that includes digital distribution, new small format stores, and renovated stores and shops to drive comp growth. As we discussed at investor day, international is a key growth opportunity for the company as we are underdeveloped in markets like China and select European countries. Mainland China is our largest near-term opportunity, and our momentum in this region continued in the first quarter. Revenue in China was up over 25% in constant currency in the quarter, including over 40% growth in Mainland China. Our digital business in China continued to grow rapidly through Tmall, JD.com and WeChat. This growth was supported by targeted marketing through social media and influencer engagements. On the store front, we opened seven new points of distribution in China in the first quarter, and we're on track to open more than 50 stores for fiscal 2019. Our new small store formats are performing well. As we continue to expand and raise our brand awareness, we are on track to achieve our long-term goals of reaching $500 million of revenue in five years in China. Another key element of our distribution strategy is provide a consistent, elevated experience across all channels. To achieve this we continue to improve the quality of our distribution through our store and shop refresh programs globally. We are elevating our distribution and our brands through improvements in fixturing, lighting, layout, and visual merchandising. We continue to see a good return on our investments with these projects. Moving on to our fourth key initiatives, lead with digital. Our overall digital business including our directly operated sites, department store.com, pure players and social commerce was up 7% globally in the first quarter. This was driven by 24% growth in international with North America up slightly. We expect to drive an acceleration of our overall digital growth as our directly operated North American digital flagship returns to growth. In the first quarter, this business showed a significant sequential improvement with a 2% decline versus the high teen declines we reported last year. We expect our site to return to growth in the second quarter as we reposition it as our most important flagship door and continue to improve the consumer experience. In the first quarter, we added improved product detail pages, 360 degree product videos, delivery date estimate and automated product recommendations among other enhancements. In Europe, we also continue to elevate and improve our digital presence. In the first quarter we upgraded the technology platform are directly operated digital flagship, similar to what we implemented in North America last fall. The new site offers a significantly improved consumer experience, including enhanced search tool and filters more engaging in easier to shop product pages, more personalized predictive recommendations and a streamlined checkout. We also continue to drive market share gains within digital at our key retail partners and in our core categories globally. For example in Europe, we ran high impact campaigns with 21 partners across the region. This included the department store websites and key online pure play customers like Asauce, Zalando, Yuk's, Mr. Porter, and Boost. The digital campaigns showcase the versatility of our polisher and how to style it. This significantly increased our brand visibility and drove sales growth. In Asia, we launched Polo on T-mobiles luxury pavilion during the quarter. We also launched a mini program on WeChat which is a digital popup shot featuring the CP93 collection. In addition we executed a successful Polo branded sticker campaign on Japan's main social messaging app, line which more than tripled our followers. Finally, let me touch on our fifth key initiative operate with discipline to show growth. In the first quarter, we continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies. This enabled us to fund the significant increase in our marketing investment while expanding operating margin and increasing operating profit. Adjusted operating expenses, excluding marketing and the impact of foreign currency were up less than 1% in the first quarter. We also continue to make progress, implementing a more efficient, streamlined end-to-end process. Discipline in our product assortments and inventory drove improved SKU productivity and full price selling. This resulted in higher AURs in gross margin. We increase that flexibility and efficiency of our global supply chain which is critical in today's rapidly-changing environment. While the terrace announced so far has a minimal impact on our business. We are keeping a close eye on developments. We believe our strong global supply network should help mitigate the long-term impact of potential scenarios. In closing as we execute our next great chapter plan and we are encouraged by our early progress and the continued improvement in the underlying trends in our business. Our teams around the world are embracing our new strategic framework and are focused on executing with excellence. Ralph and I continue to be inspired by their passion and commitment every day. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were strong and showed continued progress on strengthening the brand and driving execution. Our key initiatives are delivering strong AUR growth, lower discount, higher gross margin, and operating profit growth. First quarter revenue increased 3% on a reported basis and 1% in constant currency. This was above our guidance driven by strong performance in Asia and the benefit of wholesale shipment timing in both Europe and North America. Asia revenue grew 16% in constant currency in the quarter. Our initiatives across product, marketing and shopping experience are resonating strongly in this region. And give us increased confidence in our strategy for Asia and our other region. In the quarter, we saw higher sale through on spring summer product lead by mid single-digit growth in the Polo brand. Adjusted Gross margin expanded a 120 basis points in the first quarter and a 110 basis points in constant currency benefiting from reduced discount rate and favorable product mix. Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 11.1% up 90 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 70 basis points in constant currency. In the first quarter, we stepped up our marketing significantly off to a low base last year. Planned investment in marketing was up over 20%. For the full-year, we are planning marketing to grow high single to low double-digit with incremental growth in the second quarter to support the global amplification of our 50 anniversary fashion show. We are progressively increasing marketing investment towards our long-term goal of approximately 5% of sale. We plan to fund the majority of the increase to productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goals. Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America, revenue was down 2% in the first quarter and comps were 3% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin was 22.9% representing a 150 basis points increase to last year. Importantly, and similar to last quarter all channels contributed to gross margin improvements in the first quarter. Let me review the North America results across channels, first, our directly operated e-commerce business, second our stores; and third, our wholesale business. Digital commerce comp in a directly operated site in North America declined 2% in the first quarter. As expected, this presented a significant sequential improvement in our trend. As Patrice mentioned, we are repositioning RalphLauren.com as the most important flagship door. As part of our strategy execution, we are continuing quality of sales initiatives on our e-commerce site at a more moderate pace. Full price sales on the site were up about 5% in the quarter. AUR was up 9% and discount rate was down 300 basis points till last year. As we continue to reduce the penetration as deep markdowns in the business. Moving on to our stores, brick-and-mortar comps in North America were down 3% in the first quarter. The timing of Easter pressured comp growth by approximately three points in North America this quarter. Therefore, the underlying comp was about flat excluding that impact. As we mentioned last quarter, Easter compressed total company comp by approximately one point in Q1. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2019 Easter will negatively impact North America comp by about three points and total company by about one point. At a more macro level foreign tourist sales were flat till last year in the first quarter, less robust than the 7% growth in the fourth quarter reflecting currencies fluctuations. Moving on to North America wholesale, the first quarter revenue decline of 1% reflects a significant sequential improvement. This is partially driven by an intentional shift in timing of some of price shipments, the benefited Q1, but negatively impacted Q4. As we mentioned last quarter, our department store spring, summer 2018 season-to-date sellout improved sequentially and we expect continued improvement in the fall season as we benefit from shop renovations and evolved product and marketing. Importantly, in the wholesale channel, our digital wholesale business continues to grow with share gains in men's and kids. As a reminder, our revenue trend in North America wholesale will look more challenging in the second-half of the year. This is due to the timing of off-price shipments with significant declines planned in the second-half and the ongoing impact of Bon-Ton. Our focus remains on building high quality growth with our partners in the North America wholesale channel. Moving on to Europe, revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margins were flat, but were down 10 basis points in constant currency driven by challenges at our factory stores. In the retail channel, European comps were down 8% in constant currency with growth in digital commerce more than offset by declines in our stores. We upgraded our European digital commerce platform for our directly operated business at the end of the first quarter. We leveraged learning from the North America conversion last fall to manage the business successfully ahead of the transition resulting in strong sales in Q1. However, as anticipated, we did see some disruption from our transition, which impacted the start of the second quarter. Bricks-and-mortar comps specifically in our outlet stores continue to be pressured by inventory, traffic and product assortment challenges. We continue to work to elevate our brand and distribution and saw progress in our AURs in Europe retail, with AUR growth of 9% in the first quarter. We are implementing a number of changes in our product assortments and promotion structures to improve the traffic and conversion trends in these outlet stores. We expect these initiatives will start impacting the business in the second-half of fiscal '19. Wholesale revenue in Europe increased 13% in constant currency in the first quarter partially benefiting from a shift in shipment timing. This will negatively impact second quarter revenue. We believe our underlying trend in the channels is low to mid single-digit growth, which we expect to return to this level in the second-half of the year. We continue to see momentum in our wholesale digital business growing double-digits in the first quarter and expanding market share. Turning to Asia, revenue was up 19% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency in the first quarter. We saw a strong performance across every market in Asia including 10% growth in Japan, over 40% growth in mainland China and over 20% growth in greater China, all in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region. And we continue to increase our digital efforts in engagement with local influencers and celebrities. For example, our Polo shirt campaign generated over a billion impressions as we continued to build key celebrity partnerships. Comps in Asia increased 6% in constant currency in the first quarter continuing the positive trend from fiscal '18. We drove strong double-digit comp growth across our digital business. We expect further comp growth in Asia as we continue to upgrade our distribution network and increase our marketing initiative to amplify and elevate the brand. We also continued to drive quality of sales in Asia. In the first quarter, average unit retails were up 10% and discount rates were down. Adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points to last year in the first quarter in Asia and at 290 basis points in constant currency. We will continue with prudent quality of sales actions in Asia. We are encouraged by our top line growth and our ability to leverage our investments to drive steady operating margin expansion. Turning to our store suite, we continue to improve our retail network through the closure of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies and productivity. During the first quarter, we opened 14 standalone stores and 12 concessions. We closed two standalone stores and 11 concessions ending the quarter with 484 standalone stores and 633 concessions on a global basis. Moving on to the balance sheet, in this quarter and throughout this year, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders, reflecting the operational progress we are making. We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and investments up from $1.7 billion at the end of last year's first quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $587 million compared to $590 million last year. Inventory increased 3% on a constant currency basis at the end of the first quarter reflecting investments to support our European factory initiatives and direct-to-consumer expansion. We expect inventory growth by yearend to be slightly ahead of our sales. This will support our DTC expansion and adjustment efforts to restore inventories in select channels following significant pullback. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, this quarter we raised our dividend by 25% and repurchased $100 million of our shares. Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full-year in the second quarter of fiscal '19. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges. For the full fiscal year '19 while it is still early in the year we now expect revenues to be down slightly in constant currency. This is based primarily on our Q1 results. We continue to expect the decline in North America and growth in our international business. Foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on our revenue growth for fiscal '19. We expect our revenue trend will be more challenging in the second-half of the year versus the first-half. This is due to heavier planned reductions in off-price shipments in Q3 and Q4; timing of wholesale shipments that benefited Q1 and the lack of an Easter holiday in Q4. Excluding these factors, we expect to see continued improvement in our trend. We now expect operating margin for fiscal '19 to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency. This will be driven by about 75 basis points of growth margin expansion. Foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on operating margin for fiscal '19. This guidance reflects our solid performance in the first quarter and our view of the underlying trends as we execute the next great chapter plan. In addition, this year we will see the one-time benefit of our repatriation activity in our interest income of $35 million to $40 million and interest expense of approximately $25 million to $30 million in fiscal 2019. For the second quarter of fiscal '19, we expect revenues to be flat to down slightly. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 30 to 50 basis points in the quarter. Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal '19 is expected to be up about 30 basis points to last year in constant currency. Foreign currency is estimated to be a slight benefit to operating margin in the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $275 million in fiscal '19 focused on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return including stores, digital and marketing. We now expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '19 to be approximately 21%. The second quarter of fiscal 2019 tax rate is estimated at approximately 22%. In closing, as I said at investor day, in June, we are building the right foundation. We are focused on executing our next great chapter plan, and we are beginning to see progress across our growth initiatives. Inspired by Ralph's creative vision, our teams around the world are delivering. And this quarter demonstrates that we are on the right path toward long-term sustainable growth and value creation. With that, let's open up the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital. You may ask your question. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Your digital commerce results showed improvement in Q1. Can you talk about the drivers and what you expect for growth in FY '19? And separately, Jane, another gross margin beat. Can you parse out the gross margin drivers for the quarter, and how should we think about the gross margin cadence for the next few quarters? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Patrice Louvet : Hey, good morning, Laurent. Well, first of all, I appreciate the fact that the first question is on digital, and it's one of our core strategy is to lead with digital. And so a couple of things, one is we did make good progress this quarter on digital commerce with sales up 7% versus last year. Particularly strong growth in international, right, we were up 24% in international. And we had slight growth in North America. As we talked at the investor day, the way we look at digital commerce is really through kind of four lenses. First one is our own sites or ralphlauren.com, the second one is departmentstore.com, which is a significant channel, third are pure players, and then fourth is social commerce. So let me just give you a quick perspective on each one. So starting with our own site and think of this -- this is roughly half of our digital commerce business. Our own site, around the world, the growth was up slightly in Q1. And what we're particularly proud of is the acceleration in the North American site. Last year we reported significant declines throughout the entire year. We're still down Q1, but only down 2%. And we look forward to next quarter when we'll be able to, I think, to report actually growth on this site, which I think we've all been really hard for to achieve, so good progress there. We improved functionality and brand presentation on our U.S. site, and we will continue to drive that. As far as U.S. is concerned, I think you've heard in our prepared remarks, we upgraded our platform, basically replicating what we did in the U.S. a few months ago. And we're also quite hopeful that we'll see much stronger consumer engagement moving forward in Europe. So that's our own site. And as far as departmentstore.com is concerned and pure players, let me lump them together just to simplicity purposes. We actually grew double digits in Q1 across that channel. And obviously market share growth is very important for us, and we gained market share in our key categories across the key players. So that business is probably another -- the balance of the 50% that I talked about for our own site. And then finally we are ramping up on social commerce. It's still a negligible part of our business, but as we talked during investor day we believe this will become a significant part of digital commerce moving forward. We had our first real activity in China actually through the mini program we did on WeChat, which we focused specifically on our CP93 limited edition. So think of that as -- it's basically a digital popup store, and we saw very good consumer response there. So you're going to see us ramp up our activities on the social comments front as well. So that's kind of the perspective across the four channels. As we look out to the balance of the fiscal year we actually expect to accelerate our pace of growth in digital commerce and deliver high single-digit growth across the full-year with double-digit growth internationally. And then Jane, I guess on gross margin. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Good morning, Laurent. On gross margin, Q1 was strong. It was ahead of our expectations. We went into this quarter, June is a highly promotional quarter. And we were able to pull back on our promotion levels and discounts. That was the number one driver of our 120 basis point growth margin expansion. The other driver was some favorable product mix that we saw across the business. And so those were very encouraging. I think you saw it in our AUR increase of 8%, that it really was a strong quarter in terms of being driven by promotional pullback and quality of sales initiative. As I look forward to FY'19, we are expecting to be in about the 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. That will be driven -- continue to be driven by the pullback in promotions and discount levels. But there are two factors that we expect to become increasing pressures. One is increasing product costs. We expect that to become a headwind of about 30 basis points as we move through the quarter, it was about a 20 basis point benefit in Q1. And we continue to expect that FX switches from a tailwind to a headwind in the back half. FX was about 10 points of benefit in Q1, but should be a headwind by the time we get to Q4. So as I think about the cadence of gross margin as we move through the year I think it'll remain -- we were slightly out ahead in Q1. It should be about consistent in two and three with our guidance range. And then the most challenging quarter in terms of gross margin is Q4 when we face FX headwinds and some increased product cost pressure. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Michael Binetti : Hey guys. Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. Let me just ask you about AUR for a second. That continues to be up pretty nicely, you've mentioned it a few times. And that's even though you had some pretty meaningful off-price shipments added in the North America side, I guess, or at least a shifting of some of those shipments. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Michael Binetti : I know you mentioned June was a highly promotional quarter, so maybe that impact is less through the year. But how much of the AUR increase that we're seeing at this point, this late in the quality of sales game is from initial price points versus the ongoing reductions in promotionality or off price? And then if I could just add a second, maybe some context around that sequential acceleration in the North America wholesale business, it's not lost on us. You gave us a nice new table to look at by channel there. But that was, I think, about a 20 percentage point increase quarter-to-quarter. I know you had some timing shifts with off-price, but also we see some new distribution in places like Amazon and Urban Outfitters for the Chaps brand. So, maybe you could help us isolate a couple of the drivers or maybe just size a few of those drivers so we can understand that big acceleration? Jane Nielsen : Yes, so why don't I start with AUR, and then we'll move on to sort of the wholesale timing and cadence. AUR progress was really broad-based, and really is an indication of the work that we're doing to improve both our promotional stance, but also the work that we're doing on merchandizing and product. As we're seeing the largest driver is still our pullback from promotion, but we are seeing benefit of assorting into higher price points. We saw that come through both in North America and the international business, in retail, and in our digital business. And so really across the board strong AUR growth, really a bit out ahead of where we expected the business to be, but we expect AUR growth is a part of our strategy, as I called out during investor day. And so we continue to expect that we'll see AUR expansion. But largely, Michael, to your point specifically it's mostly our quality of sales work. As we look at our overall wholesale business, we really have a dynamic going on here that in the first half of the year we, especially in this quarter, we moved some of our off-price shipments to out of Q4 last year, into Q1 and Q2 this year. And so that is that sum of the acceleration that you're seeing in overall wholesale, we think the underlying trend in our North America wholesale business is down mid single-digit. We, while we got some benefit from shipment timing the pressures still remain in terms of challenging traffic trends, some of our quality of sales work that we continue to do, some door closures and bond time, I expect that you'll start to see -- we'll call out the underlying trend. We expect our full-priced wholesale business will improve sequentially as we move through the year. Again, there's some choppiness that'll go on, but the underlying trend will improve. And then as you look in Europe there's some shipment timing going around. We expect that that businesses' underlying trend is up low to mid single-digit. And as we come into the second half you'll start to see those underlying trends normalize because we'll be through some of the shipment timing. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan Chase. You may ask your question. Grace Smalley : Hi, good morning. This is Grace Smalley on for Matt Boss, thank you for taking my question. Just on the North America same-store sales, I think in brick-and-mortar trends may have decelerated very slightly relative to last quarter, even once you ship out the Easter shift. Is that fair? And if they were out can we think about what drove that? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Grace. Yes, that is correct. Our North America brick-and-mortar comp slowed from Q4. So down three reported, if you exclude the Easter impact it's actually basically flat versus last year. A couple dynamics, one if you look at actually the base period we were working against a much tougher comp. Q1 last year was down four, whereas Q4 was down 12. The second piece is we did see a shift in tourist business. While our tourists' sales were up 7% in Q4, they were flat in Q1. And we see that as being driven by some of the currency fluctuations that we have all observed. But what you can expect from this business is actually continued improvement on the overall comp trends. If you look at it over time, we are progressively strengthening from a comp standpoint, and that's generally what we expect for the balance of the fiscal year as our new product and new marketing activities kick in. Jane Nielsen : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Balsky [ph] with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Jane Nielsen : Heather, good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. I was hoping first, you guys seem pretty confident in ecommerce turning in the second quarter. Could you speak to quarter-to-date trends? And then with regards to Europe and the turnaround there, can you just elaborate a little bit on the changes you're making in terms of the merchandizing? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : So, listen, we can't give you quarter-to-date perspective. I can give you some perspective on what drove the improvement in Q1 in North America being a little more granular than the earlier question from Laurent. One, we stabilized the new platform, right. We launched the new platform last fall, during the holiday period. We had to work out some kinks as we worked the transition. We've now done the majority of that. Two, is we've really strengthened the functionality of the site. Being very consumer-centric, understanding what the consumer expects from the site. And so that ranges from delivery timings, to ratings and reviews, to 360 video on the product and so on which we know is resonating well with the consumer. Three, is the brand presentation as a whole is better, right. And we want this to be our global flagship. And we know we still have work to do to elevate the brand presentation, but we made progress in Q1. And obviously we've also lapped some significant discount rate reductions. And so we're getting to a more normalized situation. We will continue to improve our quality of sales on the site. There's still work to be done, but our AUR growth was healthy, I think it was 5%. Our discount rate is down 300 basis points, so we're also making progress on the quality of sales front. And so you can expect all that to continue. We are cautiously optimistic. We obviously need to execute. But I think a lot of the interventions we're making both from an operational and consumer-facing standpoint is resonating with the consumer. Jane Nielsen : Yes, Heather, I would just add that we also really encourage with the full price growth that we see on our e-commerce site and that was up 5% this quarter, which is -- they're encouraging. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. Erinn Murphy : Great, thanks, good morning. I guess I had a question on Europe. I would love to hear kind of what you're seeing broadly in that market in particular it sounds like you guys are still working through a few assortment challenges, so specific on that and then secondly as it relates to the broad promotional environment in Western Europe, have you seen any changes as you've moved through the middle of the year now? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yes, so what we're seeing in Europe on our side is the environment is a little bit more challenged. We saw some pressure in the foreign tourists sales overall in Europe. This quarter what we saw was that for interest activity was down about 15%. While we look at that relative to last year we're down about 6% that is a pressure overall in Europe as we look at our business specifically we have seen some challenge in our European outlet business. While we believe that foreign tourists are an impact there we also believe that our own assortment had gotten to basic. And that we need to get back into stock on seasonal newness and innovation newness that's part of our inventory build of this quarter and we expect in the second-half, that you'll start to see improved trends in our own business. We've done a lot of work this quarter and will continue to do a lot of work in quality of sales, so we step back from promotional levels. We do see that environment to be somewhat promotional as we move through this quarter. Patrice Louvet : And I think as we're talking earlier if you look at the various channels, so you've covered that the factory outlet situation obviously on the .com side we are in the middle of implementing our new platform, so we see encouraging signs, work to do but encouraging signs so we expect that to actually accelerate and as far as wholesale is concern while as you mentioned generally are we did have timing impacts with Q1. The overall health of our wholesale business in Europe is actually good and the team is doing some really good work there, so our key opportunity and challenged to work on really is the quality of sales force that we're doing for factory. Erinn we missed, we didn't hear your second question or we didn't hear it clearly? Erinn Murphy : Well, the second part was just on the promotional environment. I think Jane had that just kind of broadly it sounded like it would be picking up a little bit in the back half of the quarter but that was my second part of the question. Patrice Louvet : Okay, thank you. Evren Kopelman : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Omar Saad : Thank you. Good morning nice to see the lot of the defense initiatives you guys putting in really playing out in terms of the margin in the AURs, wanted to ask maybe for an update on the product side, what you're excited about where you think you are in terms of getting the product where you want to be across different channels and the different sub brands and opportunities you're excited about on the product side coming up, I don't know if [indiscernible]. Thank you. Patrice Louvet : In general, we are right where we expect it to be from a product evolutions standpoint. We're feeling good about number of categories. If you look at our results in this past quarter we actually saw growth both in men's and women's with the focus on Polo and across most of our apparel categories, so this is pretty broad-based in terms of improvements what we're seeing is our focus on icons is really paying off, so let's obviously job one for all of us continue to drive our icons. The second element is the renewal of our core is beginning to run to resonate with consumers a combination of both adding novelty, right things like embroidery things like printing is resonating well and also we freshen our fabrics pushing a greater focus on functionality again being consumer-centric and being clear on what the consumer is expecting from us, so stretching our C notes we mentioned that in our prepared remarks is resonating well with the consumer. Our denim products are actually also doing well. We had good momentum last fiscal year, we are building on that momentum this first quarter with mid single-digit growth or outerwear business, which is another focus category for us. It was a high single-digit, so where we focus and we are being really disciplined in terms of what we want to drive our activity on, we are seeing positive response from the consumer. To your question on brands where we are seeing the greatest progress at this point is Polo. But we are also seeing improvements on Lauren, so encouraged by that. So I say listen, the game plan is kind of on track but we know still have work to do and we are really focused on making sure we are bringing the vision to life and being true to who we are while connecting clearly with what the consumer expects from us across the markets, right? And Jane touched on this earlier. Some of our products, what's resonating maybe different in China than it is in wholesale North America and we are making sure we are adapting to the local needs and expectations of the consumers we are targeting. Evren Kopelman : Next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Alex Wallace with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Alex Wallace : Good morning. Thank you for the question. I wonder if you could help us with an update on your strategic initiatives in the U.S. market. In particular an update on the strategy and LA and now that you are few months into region refresh. And also the refresh of some of the department stores in the market, I was wondering if you've seen a material discrepancy between those stores, it could be refreshed and the control group. My second quarter was product cost, I just wanted to follow-up on a question from Smalley earlier. You gave us a hopeful color on the progression of the impact of product cost on a gross margin. I was just wondering if you could break that down a little bit in terms of the drivers of that, how much of that is in a proactive quality improvement, how much of it is commodity industry headwinds and so on? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure. Good morning, Alex. I think Jane and I will talk to you on this one. As far as LA is concerned, so really elevating the entire LA ecosystem is really the strategy there. We started in May indeed, yeah it's very early there as far as, so I'm always cautious to draw any conclusions a weeks and but if you push me I would say early indicators are encouraging, we are seeing growth in LA market that's slightly ahead of what we are experiencing across the country. We are also seeing from a consumer standpoint that we are attracting a new younger consumer, so we are quite encouraged by those early signs. And then, we actually saw also an acceleration of our digital commerce business in the region. So the headline thought on this is so far so good. Frankly, I wouldn't take any of this to the bank yet, I think we are in very early stages of implementation but we are seeing encouraging signs including with our new small format store in Beverly Center as you know, as we look ahead we really want to expand our brick-and-mortar footprint through small format stores, more productive, more dynamic, more flexible, better connected and few weeks in to the opening of that store we are actually also seeing encouraging response from consumers. Then on the improvement of wholesale refreshers, so we are continuing to do that. We are continuing to see benefits from doing that. We have a great partnership with our lead wholesale partner who is focused on upgrading their top 50 doors and we are working really hand-in-hand with them on driving those top 50 doors, remember which actually are in the Los Angeles region. And I think we are also thinking to what's the next phase of upgrades as our partner looks to expand that program. So across the board continuing to drive that, seeing return on investment for those upgrades and getting a solid consumer response. Jane Nielsen : And Alex, on product cost, let me pass it into to the two buckets of your questions, what we are seeing on our elevated product is that we are able to get both AIR and AUR increases to whole market as we elevate the product, so that's the good news, it challenges and I was pointing out are really centered in key input areas like polyester, cotton gown, some wage inflation as soon as some freight cost that are manifesting themselves as you competed, tight U.S. market trucking capacity. Now we are working with our suppliers to offset some of these costs to look how we work through air freight reductions to improve our freight cost. But that's really the center pressure points that we are seeing in overall product cost. Evren Kopelman : Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Company. You may ask your question. Rick Patel : Good morning everyone, and congrats on the progress early in the year. Jane Nielsen : Thanks. Rick Patel : I have a couple of follow-ups on Omar's product question. So the first one is you have five underpenetrated categories and it looks like you are making some pretty good progress with outerwear and denim. As we think about the other three categories ready-to-wear, footwear, accessories, do you expect to see an acceleration at some point in fiscal '19, or is that going to be an out year event? And then, my second question is really around some of these product drops. They've obviously been very successful and they draw a lot of interest in the brand. As we think about the future, can these ever become big enough to be growth drivers on their own with the right inventory investment and how frequently can you recycle some of your more successful ones like Snow Beach without hurting the brand appeal? Patrice Louvet : Great questions, Rick. So as far as the underdeveloped categories are concerned, we have good momentum on denim and outerwear, and actually Wear To Work, I didn't mention that; we are off to a nice start on Wear To Work both on men and women with much more to come, and yes, some of it will impact this fiscal year on Wear To Work. On the footwear and accessories piece, that one as we talked during Investor Day, it's going to be a slower burn, because we got work to do on building our capabilities and making sure we have right design capabilities, right merchandizing capabilities, right sourcing plan and obviously we are great teams in place doing that work now. So I don't know that you will see a lot -- a significant impact in fiscal year '19. Obviously, we are driving all five, but I think well you'll see the strongest progress is going to be denim, outerwear, and Wear to Work. As far as the drops are concerned, yes, they had worked really well for us. So we are excited about that. We are very -- I'm going to address your second point first; we are very careful on frequency, right, because the risk is you exhaust the consumer and then it loses all its interest and excitement. So we think we have the right pace, we have some exciting things coming in the fall, so that we will be announcing in I guess a couple of months, so we will be keeping that frequency, we will not accelerate it. And then, we are also thinking how do we expand to our woman's business because most of our drops are actually -- all of our drops so far have been focused on men and women deserve special drops too, although it will probably be a different, different approach to it. As far as size, I would not expect these to be big enough to drive the overall numbers from a pure sales standpoint, right, these are marketing activities first and foremost. Similar to what we do with the Olympics is not about driving sales of that specific capsule, it's about leveraging this capsule to tell the brand story, to bring Ralph's vision to life in a new fresh way. And that's how we view this. So we like the sales performance, we are obviously excited when things sellout within hours of days, but the fundamental objective is part of our storytelling for the brand and to really make sure that we are bringing newness and freshness in a different perspective on the overall brand. Evren Kopelman : All right, we will take one final question. Operator : The last question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Ike Boruchow : Hey, good morning everyone. Let me have my congrats; Jane just two quick ones for you on Europe, we know about the European website re-platforming and it sounds like it should be a little bit of a headwind in the near term, could you help us how to think about European e-comp comps in the second quarter, it sounds like this should be negative but just kind of want to understand that a little better. And then, you mention the tourism was down 15% in Europe this quarter. I'm just curious how that compares to what you saw three months ago. Jane Nielsen : Sure, so why don't I start with the expectations for Europe e-commerce, I do expect that e-commerce will be down sort of mid single-digit in the second quarter. And then, I expect in the second-half to be back to growth and it's really from what we are seeing from transition as we look at some of the redirects and affiliates and email setup that those will have sort of a compressive pressure in the second quarter. What we were seeing in foreign tourist sales sort of in the -- in Europe specifically in the fourth quarter was about down 20 and that was worst than we saw in the Q4 '17 and so we are looking at this down 20, down 15. The Euro did the pressure from I think foreign currency lightened a bit as we moved into the first quarter and foreign tourists tend to drag a bit as they don't follow currency trends precisely, but over time. So not unexpected, but a little bit of abatement from pressure in Europe as we as moved into the first quarter. Ike Boruchow : Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Good. Thank you. Well, listen, thanks to all of you for joining the call. As I think you can tell Ralph and I and Jane and the whole team are encouraged by the progress we are making as we implement our new strategic framework. And so now everyone is laser-focused on bringing up to life around the world, so we can get consumers excited about our brand across channels. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Ralph Lauren first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

We are pleased with our second quarter fiscal 2019 results that reflect continued progress on our Next Great Chapter strategic growth plan. We delivered both top and bottom-line growth as we continue to focus on returning the company to quality growth and value creation. Our results were driven by double-digit top-line growth in Asia and sequential progress in North America and Europe. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our plans for the full year. Our long-term plan is based on our three guiding principles : put the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevate and energize our brands; and balance growth and productivity. Let me take you through the progress we've made in the second quarter across our five key strategic initiatives, which include : first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate under-developed categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. Starting with the first one, win over a new generation of consumers; in the second quarter, our key marketing initiatives centered around our 50th Anniversary Fashion Show and key sporting events. The show, which took place in New York City's Central Park in early September, captured Ralph's 50 years of bringing authentic and timeless style to the world. We showcased the breadth of our portfolio with a highly diverse cast of models spanning generations, ethnicities, and gender. We successfully leveraged the show, driving record levels of engagement around the world across digital and social media. We had more than 3 billion social media impressions and over 100 million global views of the show online. Importantly, search volume for the brand increased high single digits versus the same period last year, based on Goggle Analytics. According to ListenFirst, a leading social analytics firm, Ralph Lauren generated more than twice as many social engagements as other brands showing at New York Fashion Week. Engaging influencers and celebrities, particularly those who resonate with different segments of our consumer base and reflect different dimensions of the brand, was a critical part of our 50th celebration strategy. Influencers across media, business, philanthropy and music from all over the globe joined us. These included : young Hollywood actors, such as Blake Lively, Anne Hathaway, and Ansel Elgort; musical superstars like Nick Jonas with his fianc\u00e9e Priyanka Chopra, Chance the Rapper, and Bruce Springsteen; to fashion stars like Taylor Hill; and our Asian influencers, such as Akira and Li Bingbing. In addition to the show, we continued to leverage the power of cultural events. The second quarter included our sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis tournament, one of the most widely attended sporting events in the world. We also outfitted the U.S. team at the Ryder Cup, one of the premier golf tournaments globally. Overall, we increased marketing by over 30% to last year in the second quarter and continue to shift our spend to channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social. Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate under-developed categories. In the second quarter, Ralph and our design team continued to drive excitement in core product categories through limited edition releases, expanded customization options and refreshed fabrications and details. As part of our 50th anniversary celebration, we partnered with MR PORTER, a leading men's online retailer, on a limited edition capsule. The collection was inspired by some of our iconic men's designs with a mix of pieces from Polo, Purple Label and RRL. The capsule launched on October 15 on the MR PORTER website and at our flagship stores. In October, we also announced our exciting new collaboration with London-based streetwear brand, Palace, which I'm sure many of you have seen. The Palace founders describe the collaboration as \"Palace Ralph Lauren is a timeless collection that represents a love letter from a young London skateboard company to their favorite brand in the universe\". Launching on November 9, the capsule collection consists of menswear pieces inspired by iconic Polo styles that the Palace creators have worn throughout their lives. It will be available : on our own Polo mobile app in the U.S., so this is a great opportunity to download it now, if you haven't already; on our new digital flagship in Europe; and across Palace's retail network. We plan to continue attracting new consumers and driving excitement around product through our limited edition releases and other exciting partnerships going forward. We also expanded our customization offerings this quarter, both online and in our stores, including a new custom shop at our recently renovated Prince Street store in New York City and at the U.S. Open. Customization plays well with gifting, and we are excited about its potential as we approach holiday. We plan to further expand our offering and choices for consumers ahead of the season. We will open our second customization shop in Asia in our Omotesando store in Japan in time for the holiday season. Moving to our under-developed categories that have significant growth potential across our brands; these include denim, outerwear, wear-to-work, footwear and accessories. We launched our first wear-to-work offering in women's Polo this fall, with an initial focus on a select number of directly operated stores and our flagship RalphLauren.com. Early results show a strong consumer response, especially to our blazers and dresses. In fragrance, we launched our newest fragrance for men with L'Or\u00e9al, Polo Red Rush, in the U.S., helping to accelerate growth in our fragrance portfolio. Focused on reaching a new generation of consumers, we had an energetic campaign featuring actor Ansel Elgort. Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; we are focused on building a compelling and competitive ecosystem centered around key cities globally. This includes digital distribution as well as new and renovated stores to drive growth. During the second quarter, we opened 36 new stores and concessions globally and closed 28 locations. This included 25 openings in Asia, with 10 in China, our fastest-growing market. Our China openings were in our key city clusters of Beijing, Taipei, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Our momentum in China continued in the second quarter. Greater China revenue was up over 20% to last year in constant currency, including over 40% growth in Mainland China, driven by comp growth and new stores. We're pleased with the performance of our new doors, as they are delivering above-average productivity and profitability. Our digital business in China is growing rapidly through Tmall, Tmall's Luxury Pavilion, JD.com, and WeChat. In the second quarter, we launched Polo on JD's luxury platform TOPLIFE. We also opened our own directly operated digital commerce site in China, RalphLauren.cn. This is the exclusive online destination for our luxury labels, men's Purple Label, and women's collection. The premium shopping experience on this site includes features such as free online and in-store returns, same-day delivery in Shanghai, live chat customer service, and integration with WeChat. We also opened two new full-price stores in Europe in the second quarter. We opened one store in London and one in Manchester, as we start to build out our ecosystem strategy in Europe as well. We are underpenetrated at brick-and-mortar retail, with only 21 full-price stores across Europe. Our expansion plans include five more openings in the second half of this fiscal year and more than 100 stores in the next five years. Moving on to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital, our global digital business, including our directly operated sites, department store dot-com, pure players and social commerce, was up 10% to last year in the second quarter, with strong performance across the board. Importantly, our directly operated North America digital flagship returned to growth as planned and delivered 9% comp increase versus last year. We attribute the improvement to our continued work to reposition RalphLauren.com as our most important flagship. This was driven by a combination of strong brand building, an enhanced consumer experience, and higher quality of sales, all enabled by our new platform that we put in place a year ago and recently rolled out to Europe. New capabilities we added in the second quarter included : new robust brand landing pages; waitlist functionality; and faster standard shipping. Our improved digital flagship experience was part of the reason for our move up to the number four spot in the L2 Global Fashion Index for digital, up from number 11 last year. L2 specifically highlighted our digital flagship relaunch in North America as well as our digital marketing and social media activity at out 50th celebration. We're pleased to see this external recognition of our digital initiatives and progress, and we continue to work towards best-in-class capabilities and functionality. In the second quarter, our directly operated European digital commerce sites also moved onto our new platform, as we continue to elevate and improve our digital presence globally. Our team managed the transition well, and our business returned to growth on our European sites by the end of the second quarter. We expect an acceleration of this growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of the significantly improved brand building, consumer experience, and functionality. In North America, we released our first-ever mobile Polo app during the quarter. The app is designed to engage the most enthusiastic members of our community of consumers by providing insider access to exclusive content and curated products. The limited edition Yankees collection that we launched in September to celebrate Ralph throwing the ceremonial first pitch at Yankee Stadium was available exclusively through the Polo app, and we sold out of the Yankees jacket within minutes of the launch. And lastly, we officially launched our mid-tier brand, Chaps, on Amazon during the second quarter. And we are encouraged by the early results and learnings. Finally, let me touch on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to fuel growth. In the second quarter, we continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies, especially given headwinds on input costs and tariffs. This enabled us to fund a significant increase in our marketing investment while expanding operating margin and increasing operating profit. Adjusted operating expenses, excluding marketing, were roughly flat in the quarter. We continue to increase the flexibility and efficiency of our global supply chain as we keep a close eye on tariffs and other trade developments. The tariffs enacted to date have a limited impact on our business, but we are continuing to diversify our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of potential tariff scenarios. In closing, as we execute our Next Great Chapter plan, we are encouraged by our early progress. Our teams around the world are embracing our strategy and are focused on executing with excellence. We've done a lot of work to ensure that every individual at the company clearly understands how his or her work supports our strategy. Speaking of our teams, I am especially proud to note that Ralph Lauren recently achieved global recognition in the Korn Ferry Employee Engagement Awards. We rank in the top three most engaged places to work across nine different countries, including Japan, China, and Korea. In addition, for the first time, we achieved certified status as a great place to work in the U.S. and were recognized on the Forbes Best Employers for New Grads list, as we focus on attracting the next generation of talent and consumers. Each member of our diverse and motivated global motivated team is contributing to deliver on our plan. And Ralph and I continue to be inspired by their passion and commitment every day and know that it will take all 24,000 of us around the world to deliver it. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrated continued execution on our strategy while navigating a more challenging global trade and cost environment. We delivered on key metrics, including mid-single-digit AUR growth, double-digit growth in digital commerce, and gross and operating margin expansion, all while delivering both revenue and profit growth. Second quarter revenues increased 2% on both a reported and a constant currency basis. This was driven by strong 13% growth in Asia and 10% growth across digital commerce. Adjusted gross margin expanded 100 basis points in the second quarter and 60 basis points in constant currency, benefiting from reduced promotional activity and favorable product, geographic, and channel mix. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 13.9%, up 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis and up 20 basis points in constant currency. In this quarter, we chose to make incremental investments in consumer-facing 50th anniversary marketing and social media amplification. We continue to make progress on our long-term objective of increasing marketing to approximately 5% of sales while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goal. Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America, revenue was up 1% in the second quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, representing a 60 basis point increase to last year. In the retail channels in North America, we posted 1% comp growth in constant currency, as our directly operated digital commerce business inflected back to growth. The 9% increase in our digital comp came as a result of incremental traffic gains. We continue to reposition RalphLauren.com as our most important flagship door with ongoing improvements in product and functionality. Our brick-and-mortar comps in North America were down 1% in the second quarter, driven by traffic declines, while AUR grew 3% year-over-year. We are focused on reversing the traffic declines through increased marketing, refreshed store environments and improved products, including expansion in under-developed categories. At a more macro level, foreign tourist sales were down about 2% to last year in the second quarter, largely reflecting currency movements. Moving on to North America wholesale, second quarter revenue was roughly flat, which was partially driven by an increase in off-price sales related to timing of shipments. For the full year, we still plan to reduce our off-price penetration within our broader wholesale channel. Our goal is to continue to improve quality of distribution and strategically reposition off-price toward an excess inventory clearance vehicle. Our full-price wholesale sales continue to be pressured by our deliberate actions to improve quality of sales and exits from lower quality distribution. While we expect volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis, our underlying trend is improving. And for full year FY 2019, we expect underlying revenue to be down low to mid-single digits versus the mid to high single-digit declines last year. Our digital wholesale business continued to grow, delivering 9% growth year-over-year in the second quarter, with continued share gains in core categories. As a reminder, our revenue trend in North America wholesale will look more challenging in the second half of the year, notably in the fourth quarter. This is due to the timing of off-price shipments that I just mentioned, with significant declines planned in the second half. Our focus remains on building high quality growth with our partners in the North America wholesale channel. Moving on to Europe, revenue was down 1% on a reported basis and flat in constant currency in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points, but were down 110 basis points in constant currency, driven by comp pressure, increased marketing and new store expansion. In the retail channel in Europe, comps were down 4% in constant currency, representing a sequential improvement from the 8% decline we reported in Q1. Our digital comp on our directly operated European website was flat, impacted by our digital platform upgrade at the end of last quarter. We saw strong quality of sales improvements, including double-digit growth in AUR and a reduction in discount rates and are encouraged by the response to our newly upgraded platform. As we got back into inventory positions and adjusted product assortments in Europe, notably in outlet, we saw an improvement in our trend with Q2 brick-and-mortar comps down 4%, representing a 5 point increase from Q1. We expect continued improvement in trends in the second half of the year. Our ongoing efforts to improve quality of sales continued, with AURs up 8% in the second quarter in Europe retail. Wholesale revenue in Europe was flat in constant currency in the second quarter. A shipment timing benefited Q1 and negatively impacted Q2, as planned. Our underlying trend in the channel remains healthy, up low to mid-single digits, including double-digit growth in wholesale digital. We expect continued volatility in Q3 and Q4 growth based on shipment timing, with growth patterns similar to those of the first half of the year. However, overall second half performance should align with our underlying growth trend. Turning to Asia, revenue was up 13% on a reported basis and 14% in constant currency in the second quarter. We saw strong performance across every market in Asia, including Japan, Korea, China and Australia. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region. And we continue to increase our digital efforts and engagement with local influencers and celebrities. Our 50th Anniversary Fashion Show in Central Park included many of our key Chinese and Japanese social influencers, who shared our brand with millions of followers. Comps in Asia increased 6% in constant currency in the second quarter. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we upgrade our distribution network and increase our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. Adjusted operating margin was up 220 basis points to last year in the second quarter in Asia and up 270 basis points in constant currency, as leverage from strong top-line performance more than offset increased marketing investment in the quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet is strong and we returned capital to shareholders, reflecting our continued operating progress. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $684 million in total debt. We used a new issue of $400 million of senior unsecured notes to retire $300 million of debt that matured in September 2018. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we repurchased $92 million in shares in the second quarter. Moving to inventory, at the end of the second quarter, inventory was up 15% to last year. About 60% of the inventory increase is related to higher in-transit inventory and earlier receipt of goods versus last year. We are utilizing less airfreight this year in order to reduce shipment costs and this resulted in a higher level of goods in transit. We also realigned our wholesale receipt calendar to better match customer demand and maximize full price selling. This also impacted quarter-end inventory level. The remaining 40% of the increase is related to higher inventory buys to support anticipated growth, including new stores, digital and comp growth. As we mentioned last quarter, we had strategic increases in our European factory stores as we cut too deeply and were out of stock last year. In addition, the second half includes the largest number of our new store openings this year, therefore, the inventory for those new stores was on hand at the end of the second quarter. As a result, our inventory levels at the end of this quarter and next quarter will be higher than we typically have during this season. We plan to moderate inventory levels by the end of this fiscal year to be better aligned with our sales outlook. Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges. We are on track to deliver our goals for the year. We now expect revenues to be flat to up slightly in constant currency for the full year fiscal 2019. This is based primarily on our strong first half top-line result. We continue to expect a decline in North America and growth in our international businesses. Foreign currency is now expected to have about 75 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2019. We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2019 to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, with minimal impact from foreign currency. This guidance reflects our solid performance in the first half and our view of the underlying trends as we execute the Next Great Chapter plan. It also incorporates the emerging dynamic of tariffs and our plans to better align inventory levels to our sales growth outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect revenues to be up low single digits in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is expected to be up about 20 basis points to last year in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to be a slight benefit to operating margin in the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $275 million in fiscal 2019, focused on consumer-facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is unchanged at 21%. Third quarter of fiscal 2019 tax rate is estimated at approximately 22% to 23%. In closing, we are moving forward in executing our Next Great Chapter plan and we continue to make operational progress in our business while navigating a more challenging global trade and inflationary environment. Our teams around the world celebrated 50 years of Ralph's creative vision and we are passionate about our future. Importantly, our teams are delivering and this quarter demonstrates that we are on the right path toward long-term sustainable growth and value creation. But before I open up the call for your questions, many of you already know that Evren Kopelman, our Head of Investor Relations, will be transitioning to a new role within the organization as CFO of Club Monaco. On behalf of the entire Ralph Lauren team, we'd like to express our gratitude for everything she has contributed to this role. Evren has led the Investor Relations team with integrity, transparency and passion. And we are confident that she will do the same for our Club Monaco business. The great news is that our IR function also has an excellent new leader, Corinna Van Der Ghinst, who will be assuming the Head of IR role. Cori spent over a decade as a sell-side analyst at Citi and as a fashion entrepreneur. She joined the RL team seven months ago and is off to a great start. Please join me in congratulating both of them and please reach out to Cori and the team on any communications going forward. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking our question and congrats on the revenue momentum. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Morning. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: What factors drove the return to growth in North America digital and are they sustainable over time? And overall, what inning do you believe you're in with digital? Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Hey, welcome. Welcome to the group. So we're actually pleased with our progress on digital commerce this quarter, both in North America and actually also internationally, but let me touch on the key drivers for the North America progress. It's really three factors for us : one, better brand building; two, an enhanced consumer experience; and then, three, continued work on quality of sales. So maybe just to give you some flavor, some of the things we drove across each of these factors. On the brand building front, we leveraged the 50th Anniversary Fashion Show with what we called an immersive website experience. We streamed the show live. We told richer and deeper stories, and we're going to continue to do that on product. We integrated our social feeds, and we launched what we've called a dynamic 50th storytelling section on the site, so much more elevated storytelling, much more elevated photography, much more interesting content. On the consumer experience front, we drove a number of changes, and we know we have significant progress to make here. So just to give you few examples of increased functionality in this past quarter; faster site loading time on mobile. Our loading time improved by 25% to 30% over the past quarter, and we know every second is millions of dollars. Product suggestions, so we introduced a May We Suggest section. Actually, we reintroduced a May We Suggest section that we had many years back and that we brought back. We've provided enhanced product detail pages. We launched favorites, and we also launched the waitlist functionality. We are now delivering more elevated packaging on our luxury items, and then we accelerated our standard shipping timings. So those are just a few of the changes we've driven. And obviously, making sure our consumers have an awesome experience on the site is critical for us. Then the third element is we continued to work on quality of sales, driving AURs and reducing our discounting over time. In terms of innings and Jane is our baseball expert on this team, listen, in terms of innings, I think, Paul, at this stage, we're really in the very early stages of the game. We actually see many more opportunities moving forward. We're planning continued growth now in North America digital commerce in the back half of the year. So we're pleased with the plus 9% we delivered this quarter and expect to continue to grow moving forward. Then longer term, our biggest opportunities are really in building the omnichannel functionality of our digital commerce operations, so better connecting our retail experiences to where the consumer wants us to show up, better connecting it to our social commerce, and so on. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you for the color. Just to quickly walk down the P&L, you had another solid quarter of gross margin expansion, but guidance does suggest that those gains may moderate somewhat in the second half. So if you could, just help us maybe better understand the puts and takes of this quarter and what we should keep in mind as the year progresses, including just how much you believe you can narrow the inventory to sales spread by year end. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Sure, so welcome, Paul. I'd be happy to take you through the gross margin. What you saw in the second quarter, we were pleased with our gross margin performance expanding 100 basis points in the quarter. The most important driver is what's been really durable over the last two years, and that is that we reduced promotion and we got our AURs up. That's going to maintain over the second half of this year and is the chief driver in expanding our gross margin 75 basis points for the full year. We also had benefits from geographic mix and channel mix. Those are also going to be durable through the second half of the year. Where we're seeing a switch is really the product cost, which was a slight headwind in the quarter, actually becomes a headwind through Q3 and Q4, and is about 30 to 40 basis points of pressure by the time we exit the year in the fourth quarter. You'll recall last year, that was a tailwind of about 80 basis points. So that's where the dynamic is shifting, and we've been calling that out for a while. And indeed, we are seeing that. Now importantly, as we think about that pressure, it incorporates the tariff pressures that we're seeing from the existing legislation and incorporates some of the freight and input cost inflation that we're seeing. And then FX, which has been a nice tailwind to us in the first quarter of about 10 basis points and in the second quarter of about 40 basis points, moves into a headwind in the second half of the year. So those are really the drivers. We're really pleased that we continue to expect gross margin expansion, and we're holding to our guidance on gross margin expansion. But we do see, as we've called out for a while, some of those pressures coming. As we look at inventory, we expect inventory to more closely align with our sales outlook by the fourth quarter. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the expense front, Jane, I guess help us to think about the SG&A efficiencies remaining from here. And maybe just elaborate a little on the timeline for SG&A line item leverage if comps were to turn positive going forward. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So as we think about big initiatives in terms of what we're seeing in SG&A, we have a number of focus areas across our costs. We're seeing some of the benefits from the procurement initiatives that we instituted. We're starting to see some nice distribution savings that will mostly manifest themselves in FY 2020 from the work that we're doing, and a disciplined approach to overall costs. And overall in the quarter, we've seen our payroll costs reducing. And of course, as I called out, we invested in marketing this quarter. As I look to the back half of the year, we'll continue to invest in marketing, notably in the third quarter. Now recall, last year in the first half of the year, marketing was down. It was up in the second half. We are going to invest and expect to have increased marketing in the third quarter, but some leverage in the fourth quarter overall. And so I think you'll see the expense flow be a little higher in the third quarter and advantaged in the fourth quarter as we move through the year. But as you saw in our guidance for the full year, we expect operating margin expansion and our revenue to be flattish to slightly up. And so I think you'll see some nice profit accretion top to bottom line. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura. You may ask your question. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura/Instinet: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. And congrats on the progress. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Simeon. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Simeon. Simeon Avram Siegel - Nomura/Instinet: Jane, any view on how much more room you have to grow AUR? You've obviously been doing a fantastic job there. And then any way to quantify the savings you expect from reducing the airfreight. And then, Patrice, any learnings you can share on maybe favorite question on Amazon, anything that you've seen there with our relationship? Thanks. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Sure. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Sure. So I would say on AUR growth, AUR growth is a key part of our strategic plan that we outlined. So we expect AUR growth as we move through into the second half so that will continue. And then as we look out over the next five years, because we're elevating our brand, we're moving to a more direct-to-consumer distribution, you will see AUR growth through the remainder of the plan. So, we see it as durable. We see it as an important part of the plan. It's a combination of reduction in promotion, selective and surgical price increases, as needed, notably on new products. And overall, assorting into higher AURs, notably in our international markets, where consumers have been very receptive to that. The shift out of airfreight is a part of our ongoing saving strategy to move to more efficient forms of freight transport. Freight, in total, is about 3% to 5% of our COGS, so it's important. It's a nice shift, but I wouldn't say it's a material driver of overall COGS. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And I guess on your Amazon question, so maybe just starting with a bigger picture on pure players for us. Pure players is a key building block of our digital commerce strategy. And, actually, this quarter, pure players was the fastest growing part of our digital commerce business. As far as the U.S. is concerned, we're now live with our Chaps pilot on Amazon. We've been on there for several weeks. We're actually encouraged by the early results, the higher AURs, frankly, than we expected, so we'll see whether that continues. And then the learnings that we're generating together with Amazon, so feeling good about that. But, obviously, very early days and we'll report over time in terms of how we're performing. And then on the broader Amazon conversation, we are continuing our dialogue with Amazon. We are very clear on the four key principles for us to participate in pure play business. They haven't changed, right: brand building presentation; pricing integrity; making sure that no non-authorized third-party sellers or counterfeit products are available on the site; and working with the partner on access to consumer data. So those four principles are still in place. We are now there on the balance of the portfolio with Amazon in the U.S. We're actually making progress across many different pure players around the world, including here in the U.S. We just joined Stitch Fix, Olivella in the U.S. and also new customers around the world. So continuing to drive it and continuing to drive the dialogue with Amazon and looking carefully at our experience in our pilot with Chaps. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Great. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. You may ask your question. Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Congrats to the team, and especially Evren on the promotion, very well done. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks, Brian. Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I think you guys talked about share gains in North America in the department store on the digital side, so curious how do you feel about share dynamics overall in North America wholesale? It's been a while, I think, since you guys talked about share gains? And then the second question would be, would you expect the off-price sell-ins to be down next year as well or is this really the big cleanup year? Thank you very much. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Well, why don't we tag-team on that one with Jane, Brian. So as far as share is concerned, we believe greatly in share, right. Because ultimately, it's the measure of consumer voting, so it is something that we watch. As far as the U.S. performance is concerned, so our men's wholesale share is basically stabilized. So it's now been stable for a couple quarters after 13 quarters of decline, so we're encouraged by the stabilization. Obviously, success is not stabilization. Success is growth. We are growing share online on wholesale dot-com so we're actually excited about the progress we're making there. And we're now all focused on making sure we deliver share in the brick-and-mortar part of wholesale. We're doing that through the marketing investments and engaging marketing activities. We're doing that through, obviously, all the product work that's going on, both on the core and on the newness. And we're doing that through renovating our doors. And that continues to be a program on which we are making solid progress to make sure the brand is presented in a way that's consistent with how we view it and how we want it to show up to consumers in 2018. So I think that's the share picture. Jane, you want to talk about off-price? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So, on the off-price reduction, it's going to be down meaningfully this year. As we move out into the out years of our strategic plan, we do plan to reduce our penetration of off-price to our wholesale channel. So we expect it to be compressive, if you will, to our overall growth. We contemplated that with our algorithm as we looked at our five-year strategic plan. Will it be negative or not? I think it's too soon to call. It'll be based on our overall wholesale outlook. And we're managing that channel prudently, but we've acknowledged it is a pressure point to our overall growth algorithm and we've contemplated that. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. You may ask your question. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and Evren and Cori, congratulations again. My question centered around the capsule launches you highlighted in your prepared comments. I just wondered how you were thinking about managing the cadence and availability of these collections going forward and what ROI are you seeing from these specific capsule launches so far. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So overall, we're excited about the role these capsules play within our overall brand building program. We are very clear that we have to do this at the right pace, because if you do it too frequently, it loses its sense of excitement and interest. We think we have the right drumbeat, so we expect to continue to do these at the pace that I think we've established so far. And, listen, every time we drop one, we're getting immense excitement and great interest. The latest one is Downhill Skier, so available on our app for those of you who want to access it. And initial results are quite positive behind that. But it is part of our broader brand building program and product program moving forward, right? If you think about it from a product standpoint, one, we obviously want to drive the core. We're seeing positive results on the core. Then we want to use limited editions in capsules and personalization to bring excitement to the brand. And then, obviously, a third plank is the under-developed categories that we've been talking about. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: From an ROI perspective, Kate, we look at these as really they have a great marketing value. They tend to sell out and sell out at full price. Our teams have gotten very adept at developing them, so the incremental costs are minimal. So we see them as a good product ROI and, more importantly, a great marketing ROI. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Omar Saad - Evercore ISI : Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the digital inflection. Sorry if I didn't pick up on this, but I'm trying to understand how much of that inflection to positive trends in the digital comps is a matter of kind of cycling the closing down of all the promotions that were driving traffic and sales and just kind of winding that down and not having to comp against that so much versus kind of more offensive measures that are really driving consumer demand and excitement in that channel, maybe if you could help us understand what are the key driver in inflection. And also on the Polo app, while we're on digital, maybe you could talk about the possibility for a membership program or some sort of loyalty program. We're seeing more brands kind of combine membership and loyalty with their own apps to engage with the consumer more directly. Thanks. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Sure, Omar. I'll take the first part and then I'll let Patrice talk about what we're doing moving forward. What we've seen in terms of our inflection back to growth, there's no denying that we are overlapping a significant reset of our digital business to drive price harmonization, to become less promotional. I think we've accomplished that. And encouragingly in the quarter, what we see is that our full price business on our website is growing nicely, so that's an important part of what you're seeing in terms of the growth. But what I can't do is break out exactly what's the benefit of the improvements that we've made to the site and how much that's impacting. We did see the key driver is improved traffic and so that we know that that's helping the top line and that traffic is getting a better experience. But I think that the reset that we've done as we look at full price selling, which has been up nicely in this quarter, is an important part of the driver. So I think they really go hand-in-hand. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: And then on the app, I mean, we're actually really excited. We're finally able to make an app available to our fan community around the world. Loyalty point is spot on, Omar, which is ultimately, we will want to have a loyalty program for our best customers. We'll need to make sure that we offer relevant value for them. But certainly, that's consistent with our thinking on this platform. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. And I'll add my thanks to Evren and Corinna. Can we dig in on North America wholesale for a second? Flat in the quarter; I think that in the first quarter, that was down mid-single digits and excluding some one-time shifts and then flat this quarter. Jane, do you feel like that's a pretty comparable number to the underlying negative mid-single digits in 1Q or were there any puts and takes in the second quarter to think about? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: We saw North America, overall in the first quarter, wholesale business was down low single digits. And we see it flattish in the second quarter, up slightly in the second quarter. I think it's relatively comparable. What I'm seeing in the underlying trend, the underlying full price trend is that from first half to second half, we're making sequential progress. So we're very encouraged by that. We saw in the first half, sort of, some high single-digit to mid-single-digit declines. As we go into the second half, we expect to see that improve to be more towards the overall trend, of sort of low to mid-single-digit declines in our full price business, which is a meaningful improvement from what we saw last year. So overall, we're encouraged. Most of the noise is coming from the shipment timing of off-price, but we see sequential progress in our full price North America wholesale business as we move into the second half of the year. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: If I roll that forward, just thinking about the math, it looks like revenues are poised to decline mid to high single digits in fourth quarter on the North America wholesale side or on the... Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: That's right. Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'm sorry, on the total company, mid to high singles. Looks like currency will be about a 3 point drag. And then I think you had an Easter shift that maybe is a point there. So underlying, we're low single digits, as the rest of that inflection from third quarter back to negative in fourth quarter? Is that fully explained by the off-price shift that you're speaking about? Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Okay. So we've got a lot of dynamics. Let me just sort of pull them apart. In the fourth quarter, you're exactly right, Michael. We've been calling out for a while. What you're going to see if you step back, first half to second half, you're going to see overall trend improvement. In the first three quarters, consistent with our guidance of this year, are very positive. Fourth quarter, as we said, has a number of factors that we've called out. One is, the Easter shift, which is 3 points to North America comp and a full point to the total company. This is total company revenues. We've called out reductions in off-price. And then shipment timing in Europe for their wholesale business is going to be favorable in the third quarter, but it will decline in the fourth quarter, very similar to what we saw in the first half of the year. Those are the three drivers that get you to the guidance squeeze on the fourth quarter, which is our most challenging top line quarter. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Alexandra Walvis - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions, a couple of questions for me on the brick-and-mortar presentation for the brand. So firstly, on the wholesale side, Patrice, you made a comment earlier that the refreshes that you've been making with some of the department store partners have been progressing well. Can you remind us how many of these that you've done, how many of these there are still to go? What proportion of the fleet does that represent and whether there's further momentum that we can expect there? Second question on brick-and-mortar relates to your own brick-and-mortar business. You've seen this material inflection in your e-commerce, RalphLauren.com business. What needs to happen for the brick-and-mortar comps to inflect materially positively? Is it a case of more store remodels? And you've mentioned previously that we should expect some more omnichannel initiatives, so perhaps that's part of the story, but I'd be interested in your thoughts there. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So starting with the wholesale renovation, so far over the past 12 months, we've done about 175. Obviously, we're focusing first and foremost on those bigger doors, so not every door is treated equally. Some of these include the doors that our biggest partner is renovating at the same time, their top 50. That represents about 10% of sales. So we're early days in this exercise. Where we have done it, we've seen an acceleration of top line growth and we see a good financial return on it. So we're actually quite encouraged by the early results we're getting behind this. What we'd like to do, I think we talked it during Investor Day, is over the next three years, we want to get to at least 60% of our business, which will represent the majority of the core doors for the business; so continuing to drive that both here in the U.S. and also doing that around the world. We just redid our Selfridges doors. So those of you who are traveling in the UK, you'll get a chance to see that. That was redone about three or four days ago, and the early indications are positive. As far as the second part of your question, which is when do things turn from a brick-and-mortar standpoint and what's going to be different relative to e-commerce, I think it's really the key elements of the strategy that we've called out, which is making sure that our marketing is connecting with a new generation of consumers and getting those consumers excited about what we have to offer. It's really around product and getting the right balance between core and fashion and leveraging the capsules and the special partnerships and personalization, as we talked earlier, to drive that. And then indeed to your point, the omnichannel dimension is critical, so we look at it as a whole, because we need to make sure we're connecting as much as possible wholesale dot-com and wholesale brick-and-mortar because we are encouraged by the progress we're seeing on dot-com, and so it's leverage the momentum that we're building there. But it's the fundamentals of product, communication, and store. And I am actually really pleased with the way the teams are actually treating against all those three elements. So we should continue to see incremental sequential progress as we put one foot in front of the other in driving the acceleration of the business. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. Congrats, Evren and Cori, on the moves. I guess, Jane, I want to focus on Europe, or Patrice, just first thoughts on the overall market. There's clearly been some very unseasonable weather and a lot of partners and brands have struggled there, just what you're seeing from a macro perspective maybe the UK versus the EU. And then, Jane, I just wanted to ask about the comp forecast for the back half. I think you talked about continued improvement on the comp line at Europe. Is that a return to growth improvement or, is that just less bad, less negative comp trajectory through the year? Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Let me start and then you take on, Jane. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: So listen, as far as overall Europe is concerned, Ike, we're actually performing in line with our expectations for Q2. So it's the same thing, delivering sequential progress, I think we talked earlier about the progress we're making on direct comps. We're also seeing good performance on wholesale. So we're not seeing macro dynamics really shift significantly for our business. We've also assumed relatively tame progress from a macro standpoint in Europe moving forward. I think we're assuming basically flat overall growth for the region. And we have outlawed weather as an explanation for business performance at Ralph Lauren. So listen, weather was not clearly a tailwind, but we have to control our destiny and we've I think leveraged other dimensions of our portfolio and business model to drive the business forward, so all in all, seeing good performance on wholesale. There are timing dynamics, but low to mid-single-digit performance in European wholesale, better transition than expected on our platform on dot-com, great work by the team there, so feeling good about that. And then, as you saw, sequential progress on retail comps, minus 4% Q2, minus 8% the quarter before that, and we expect that progress to continue. Jane Hamilton Nielsen - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Yes. Ike, as we said, one thing that we might call out is that we do see some weakness in foreign tourists, largely probably based on what we're seeing in the euro. But overall in Europe from a comp perspective, we were very pleased with the 5-point improvement we saw going from Q1 to Q2 in our bricks-and-mortar comps. And, as you know, we made a significant investment in inventory in that market to get back into more seasonal product, a little more innovation in our product, notably in our outlet stores, and we're seeing that working. And so we expect our bricks-and-mortar comp as a reflection of that investment in inventory, and in conjunction with marketing investments that we've made, that you'll see an improvement in the second half. We don't guide comps by region, but we expect to see some nice improvement as we move through the second half. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: We'll take one last question, please. Operator : Thank you. The last question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. You may ask your question. Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Evren, thank you very much and congratulations to you guys. Evren Dogan Kopelman - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Thanks. Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So I guess if we could spend just a little bit of time on China, I'd love to hear how you guys feel about how the Ralph Lauren brand relationship with the Chinese consumer is and marketing plans there. And specifically, there's a lot of talk around tourism, but trends in Hong Kong, Macau, more tourist-driven markets there. I just wonder if you could just give us some insight into what you're seeing there. Thanks very much. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: Sure. Good morning, Bob. So, listen, we're excited about our progress in China, right. You saw the numbers. They continued to be strong in Q2 : Greater China, up 20%; Mainland China, up 40%, consistent with what we delivered in the first quarter. So we have nice momentum, nice momentum there. If you kind of peel the different elements apart, our digital business is growing double digits there. We just launched our digital flagship RalphLauren.cn, so we're excited about that. We just joined TOPLIFE within the JD platform. We're also excited about that, so, in general, good progress on the digital commerce front. And then, we're continuing to drive our brick-and-mortar presence in the context of the ecosystem we want to build around these big cities, the Shanghais, the Shenzhens, the Beijings and Hong Kongs of this world. We ended the quarter with 68 stores in China. We are on track to open 50 in total for the fiscal year. And what's exciting and gets to your specific consumer question is what we're seeing in terms of consumer engagement is we're bringing in a good balance between men and women, right. So, you know, globally, our business trends to be more skewed towards men. But in China, actually we've got a good 50%-50% balance between men and women. We're bringing younger consumers, right, so consumers in their 20s and 30s which we feel good about. And then we're also seeing consumers who are prepared to buy at the high-end of our range from a product standpoint, so one illustration, cashmere, which is one of our higher-priced items, consistently is in the top 10 selling items in China. And as a whole, we're actually seeing the consumer ready to migrate to the higher parts of our portfolio. From an awareness standpoint, we continue to build awareness. It's always a little tricky to get reliable awareness data in China, but from the latest indications we had is the marketing that we're doing there with influencers weaving the brand into the cultural fabric of China is clearly resonating. And the fact that we had a number of our influencers at the show obviously helped. And we've got Singles' Day coming up, so we'll do a lot of good marketing around that. We're not going to leverage it as a promotional tool. We really focus on it as a brand building tool. But I would say the response that we're getting from consumers, men and women, across Mainland China and Greater China is actually quite encouraging. And we're building good momentum. And you know what our goal is for the business. We want to hit $0.5 billion in the next five years. And if we continue at this pace, then we'll get to that number and probably a little bit more. On tourism, actually tourism is a relatively small part of our business, right, so the whole Daegu conversation and so on really doesn't apply much to us. Obviously, it's an area of development for us, but at this point certainly not a vulnerability. Patrice Jean Louis Louvet - Ralph Lauren Corp.: All right, that closes the morning. Listen, thank you to all of you for joining us today. This is clearly an important year for us as we celebrate our 50th anniversary and not many companies get to do that in this industry. And I do want to take this opportunity to congratulate Ralph and the entire team on what we've accomplished so far and the ongoing work that we're all doing to deliver for the future as we write our Next Great Chapter. We're pleased with our early progress and results as we continue to strengthen our connection with the consumers around the world. We again want to thank Evren for everything that she's done on this part of the business. And I really look forward to you helping us drive Club Monaco to glory. And then, Cori, officially welcome in your new role. This is great succession planning, I think. And we look forward to talking to all of you over the course of the next quarter or at the call the next quarter. So thank you and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We're pleased to report better than expected third quarter results during the important holiday season, as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. As we discussed at our Investor Day last spring, our teams are focused on delivering long-term sustainable growth and value creation. In the third quarter, we outperformed our expectations on both the top and the bottom line with double-digit EPS growth. Our results were driven by double-digit revenue growth in Asia and Europe and strong sequential progress in North America with better than expected AUR growth globally. During the third quarter, we continue to drive our execution and performance against the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five-year Next Great Chapter plan. These include; first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansions in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. As we look to close up the fiscal year, we remain on track to achieve our plans for the full year. Let me now highlight some key progress points starting with new generation of consumers. In the third quarter, we increased marketing investments by 18% to last year. We continue to shift our spend to channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social. Our key marketing initiatives this quarter centered around our limited edition collections and holiday camping. On our last call, we announced an exciting new collaboration with UK-based streetwear brand Palace. Launched in November, the capsule collection consists of menswear pieces inspired by iconic Polo styles that the Palace creators Lev and Gareth have worn throughout their lives. The products sold exclusively on our Polo mobile app in the U.S, our digital flagship in Europe and across Palace's retail network. We approach the collaboration as an opportunity to reach new and younger consumers with a fresh take on product that still remain true to the DNA of the Polo brand. The collaboration generated over 2 billion impressions globally exceeding our expectations. The Palace collection sold out in under an hour online. We were encouraged that roughly 75% of the people who purchased it globally were completely new to Ralph Lauren. The collaboration was particularly effective in engaging the Millennial and Gen Z consumers with those purchasing the collection, 10 years younger on average than the typical Polo men consumer. We are now little more than a year into our approach to drive energy and excitement around our brand with limited edition releases, and we continue to be encouraged by the traction these drops are gaining. In December, we launched our Winter Stadium collection which was available on our Polo mobile app in the U.S. and in key flagship stores globally. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers including Opening Ceremony and Clothing, Hypebeast's e-commerce site HBX and Selfridge's. Winter Stadium generated over 1 billion impressions globally and achieved nearly 100% sell through on our Polo app in the first day. In addition to attracting new consumers to our franchise, we're excited to see new fan base developing for our drops. Over half of the Winter Stadium shoppers were repeat customers who had already purchased from at least one of our limited editions previously. We also continued our 50th anniversary celebrations in the third quarter with our holiday gifts camping RL50gifts which we amplified through social media influencers and celebrities like Emmy Rossum, Rachel Zoe, Cameron Dallas and Olivia Palermo. About one third of the consumers who shop product highlighted in our holiday camping were new to Ralph Lauren and a meaningful portion of these new consumers were under the age of 35. In addition to our holiday gifting campaign, we continue to leverage the use of celebrities and influencers across different areas of pop culture and sports. In the third quarter, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Alex Rodriguez, Gigi Hadid and the Chance the Rapper were among the stars featured in our brand. We kicked off reward season dressing with actors Chris Pine, Lady Gaga and Lupita Nyong'o. You've also maybe have seen Ralph's incredible custom designs for the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra to music superstar Nick Jonas in India in December. It was the first wedding dress that Ralph has designed for a bride outside of his own family. The wedding was a global event that transcended cultures and dominated social media platforms. Moving onto our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate underdeveloped categories. Our strong top line performance this quarter was driven by our core products as Ralph and the design teams continue to drive excitement in the marketplace. This is consistent with our year-to-date trends and expectations that iconic and updated core styles will be a more meaningful near-term driver while we continue to develop our high potential underpenetrated categories for the longer-term. Top performing core products in the third quarter included Oxford shirts, Half-Zip sweaters, Women's Cashmere sweaters and Mesh Polo. In addition, we continue to build upon our customization program this quarter with monogramming services and expanded customization offerings in the European market. Customization continues to represent an important long-term opportunity for direct-to-consumer channels, driving AURs at a higher than our overall digital commerce AURs, higher gross margins and no returns. Moving to our underdeveloped categories that have significant growth potential across our brands these include denim, outerwear, wear to work, footwear and accessories. Our sell of trends in denim and outerwear, which are the further developed of the five categories accelerated in the quarter with an improved merchandising and distribution focus, indicating a positive consumer response to our new initiatives. Outerwear performance accelerated this winter as we continue to focus on our core nylon and down jackets while also injecting the category with new fabrications, innovation like our RL Heat launch this month and focus on end users like active, weekend and weekday dressing. In fragrance, we launch a new camping in January around the Ralph Lauren Romance fragrance for women bring a fresh take a new packaging to this iconic scent just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day. The spring campaign featured supermodel Taylor Hill as the new face of the fragrance, along with her boyfriend actor Michael Stephen Shank. Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We are focused on building a compelling and competitive Ralph Lauren ecosystem in key cities globally. This includes digital distribution as well as new and renovated stores to drive growth. During the third quarter, we opened 39 new stores and concessions globally and closed 12 locations. This included 24 openings in Asia with nine in China, our fastest-growing market. Our China openings this quarter were focused on our key city clusters of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Chengdu. We continue to drive strong growth in China in the third quarter. Greater China revenue was up 19% to last year in constant currency including nearly 40% growth in mainland China, driven by comp growth and new stores. We are taking a disciplined approach to our new store openings in China and closely monitoring macro trends. However, we are pleased with the performance of our new doors thus far as they are delivering above-average productivity and profitability. Our digital business in China continues to expand following the launch of our directly operated digital commerce site last September. We also continue to see strong momentum in our distribution with pure play partners including Tmall, JD.com, and WeChat during the quarter with very positive brand exposure over single-stay. In Europe, we opened two new full-price stores and two net new factory stores in the third quarter. The new full-price stores in Leeds and Marseille are part of our broader ecosystem strategy in those markets. Similar to China, we are actively monitoring the macro environment in Europe including the UK that will continue to take a cautious approach the store rollout in the region as we test and learn from each new opening. However, we are still significantly underpenetrated at brick-and-mortar retail with only 23 full-price stores across Europe, and we continue to see a meaningful, long-term opportunity to build out our ecosystem strategy in the region. Our expansion plans include two more openings in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Moving on to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital business including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce was up 20% to last year in the third quarter in constant currency with strong performance across all regions. Our directly operated North America digital flagship continued on the positive growth trajectory as planned and delivered a 21% comp increase as we lap last year's transition to the cloud-based platform. Our focus on strong brand building and enhanced consumer experience and higher quality of sales, all contributed to improve performance as we continue to reposition the site as our most important flagship. Our directly operated European digital commerce sites also showed strong improvement following the move to our new platform earlier this fiscal year. This business returned to growth in the third quarter as planned with a 13% comp. Enhancements to our European sites this quarter included the launch of shift from stores across Europe, enabling us to leverage our in-store inventories to service demand, customization services and our first fully localized Spanish digital commerce site. Looking ahead, we expect to see more normalized positive growth in this channel as a result of improved brand building, consumer experience and functionality. We also continue to drive strong performance on pure play accounts across all regions of the third quarter. In the U.S. we expanded our presence on Stitch Fix with women's Polo and men\u2019s footwear and added 15 new digital pure play partners in Asia and Europe. Finally, let me touch on our fifth key initiative operate with discipline to fuel growth. In the third quarter, we continue to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies. This enabled us to continue ramping up our marketing investment and expand our global retail presence while increasing operating profit and expanding operating margin above our guidance. Adjusted operating expenses excluding marketing were slightly below top line growth in the quarter. Jane will provide more details on how were continuing to drive productivity. So in closing, while we are mindful of ongoing market volatility, we are energized by our continued progress this quarter on our Next Great Chapter plan. Ralph and I along with our talented and committed teams around the world remain focused on things through to the timeless vision of our brand while evolving to meet the needs of consumers globally. While we are proud of the progress we're making, we will continue to relentlessly focus on excellent execution as we deliver on the commitments that we have made across every aspect of our business. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice and morning everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate our teams continued disciplined execution of our strategy we delivered on key metrics including 9% AUR growth in retail, double-digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, all while delivering both revenue and EPS growth. Importantly, we achieved these results in the context of navigating a more uncertain macro and geopolitical environments. Third quarter revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 6% in constant currently. Every region delivered top line growth led by strong 10% sales growth in both Europe and Asia on a reported basis and strong holiday season in North America. Adjusted gross margin expanded 90 point in the third quarter and 60 basis points in constant currency benefiting from reduced promotional activity and favorable product, geographic, and channel mix. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 13.9%, up 70 basis points from last year on a reported basis and 50 points in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 11% to last year. SG&A expense excluding marketing slightly leverage our strong top line growth. This quarter we made important proactive investment in our brand and our business. We increase our marketing spend by 18% to 4.2% of sale up from 3.8% last year. This marketing investment is overlapping the strong investments made in the second half of FY '18. Incremental investment centered on our holiday marketing campaign and limited edition collection. In our digital business, we also made investments to strengthen our digital platform and capabilities. We continue to make progress toward our long-term objective of increasing marketing to about 5% of sale while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goal. Our teams are intensely focused on driving operating efficiencies across our business. For example in the third quarter our teams across the Company's work to our warehouse and office real estate footprint in North America, we completed the sale of our Beachwood distribution facility in North Carolina, reducing our footprint to two buildings from four buildings two years ago. This is an important step in our shared inventory strategy which went live this week, enabling us to reduce our overall inventory, maximize full-price selling, improve the CPU cost of our DTC fulfillment and lower overhead cost. We are also significantly reducing our New York office footprint which includes our corporate office, and design studios. Over the next year, we will consolidate our footprint to four primary locations in the New York try state area, down from over a dozen locations two years ago. Following the move and 2020, we will reduce our square footage, cost per square foot and most importantly drive greater collaboration across our teams. Moving to our segment performance, starting with North America, revenue was up 3% in the third quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.6% representing a 20 basis point increase to last year's. In the retail channel in North America, we posted 4% comp growth in constant currency as brick-and-mortar comps were flat and our directly operated digital commerce business was up 21% as we anniversary the change of our own digital commerce sites last year's and saw strong double digit AUR increases during this holiday quarter. We are also encouraged by strong performance across our total digital ecosystem including wholesale.com and pure play with double-digit growth in the quarter. We saw continued sequential improvement in our North America brick-and-mortar comp this year, driven by 7% AUR growth in the third quarter, which more than offset traffic headwinds. Moving onto North America wholesale, third quarter was down 3% due to planned reductions in off-price sales. These reductions will continue through Q4. For the full year, we still expect to reduce our off-price penetration within our broader wholesale channel as we strategically reposition off-price back towards its original purpose as an excess inventory clearance vehicle. While we expect volatility in our full-price wholesale business on the quarter-by-quarter basis including the fourth quarter, our underlying trend is improving. For fall 18, our Q3 sell out performance at wholesale improved on both of sequential basis and relative to the prior year. At the end of the quarter, based on our estimates, we believe our inventory at our full-price wholesale partners well-positioned and below prior-year levels. For full year FY '19, we continue to expect underlying revenue to be down low to mid single digits versus the mid to high single-digit declines last year. Our digital wholesale business continued to grow in the third quarter, delivering high single-digit growth to last year with continued share gains in core categories. Moving on to Europe third quarter revenue was up 10% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points but were down 40 points in constant currency. SG&A leverage was more than offset by gross margin contraction to do the faster growth in wholesale shipment driven by timing shift from Q4 into Q3. In the retail channel in Europe, comps were up 4% in constant currency, driven by 13% growth in digital commerce and a 3% increase in brick-and-mortar stores, compared to 4% comp decline in Q2. The sequential improvement in our brick-and-mortar trend was primarily driven by our investment to get back into inventory positions notably in outlet and improve the breadth and depth of our product assortment. Comps in our directly operated European digital commerce business also continued to improve following our platform upgrade at the end of Q1. We saw strong quality of sales improvements, double-digit growth in AUR and a reduction in discount rate and are encouraged by the consumer response to our new platform. Across retail, our ongoing effort to improve quality of sales continued you AUR up 11% in the third quarter in Europe retail. Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 20% in constant currency in the third quarter. Our third quarter growth benefited pull forward in the shipment timing which will negatively impacts the fourth quarter. Excluding timing shift, we now expect our reported growth to be mid-single digit range for full year fiscal 19, up from low to mid single-digit previously as we see the benefit from both distribution expansion and comp growth. Turning to Asia, revenue was up 10% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency in the third quarter. We saw strong performance across every market with positive growth across Japan, Korea, China and Australia. Growth was lead by Mainland China with constant currency revenue growth of almost 40%. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continued to increase our digital efforts engagement with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 4% in constant currency, driven by almost 10% AUR growth. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we invest in our distribution network and increase our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. In the third quarter, adjusted operating profit grew 7% to last year, adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points and down 10 basis points in constant currency, as gross margin improvements were more than half by increased marketing investments in the quarter. Excluding marketing, operating margin in the region would have expanded to last year. Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet is strong and we returned capital to shareholders, reflecting our continued operating progress. We ended the quarter with 2.1 billion in cash and investments and 687 million in total debt, which compared to 2.1 billion in cash and investments and 589 million in debt at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 18. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we repurchased 208 million shares in the third quarter for a total of 400 million year-to-date. Including dividends and share repurchases, we returned a total of 542 million to shareholders this fiscal year-to-date, up from 122 million last year. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock as a part of our plan to repurchase of billion dollars in shares through fiscal 20. Moving onto inventory, at the end of the third quarter, inventory was up 11% to last year, moderating from a 15% increase in the second quarter. Similar to Q2, our inventory growth in the third quarter reflects strategic actions to support the following; one, earlier receipt of goods to maximize full-price selling; two, comp growth; three, new retail distribution; and four, getting back to normalize inventory in our Europe factory stores. We are also utilizing significantly less airfreight this year in order to reduce shipment costs, which impact level of goods and transit. We remain comfortable with the health of our overall inventory at both retail and wholesale which continues to improve on year-over-year basis. Looking ahead, we expect to continue reducing inventories through the end of this fiscal year to be better aligned with our sales outlook. Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal 19. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges. We are on track to deliver our goals for this year. We now expect revenues to be up slightly in constant currency for the full year fiscal 19. We expect a slight decline in North America and positive growth in our international businesses. Foreign currency is expected to have 80 to 90 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 19. We now expect operating margin for fiscal 19 to be up 60 basis points in constant currency at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points with minimal impact from foreign currency. This guidance reflects our solid performance in the first three quarters of the year and our view on underlying trends as we execute the Next Great Chapter plan. It also incorporates our plan to better align inventory levels to our scales growth outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 19, we expect revenues to be down slightly in constant currency with growth in North America retail and our international businesses offset by a planned reductions in North America off-price sale. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 300 basis points in the quarter. We continue to see several timing related headwinds to revenue growth in the quarter including a shift in European wholesale shipments from Q4 into Q3, and our strategic reduction in off-price sales, which is heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter of this year. The time of Easter also negatively impacts our North America retail comps by about three points in the fourth quarter benefiting Q1 of next year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up about 70 points to last year in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 60 basis points in the quarter. We now expect capital expenditures of approximately 250 million in fiscal 19. Below our previous guidance of 275 million due to timing shifts into fiscal 20, our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal 19 is changed to 21%. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is estimated to be 16% to 17%. Finally, over the past several months, we have seen increased volatility in the market from macroeconomic and geopolitical events, and we continue to monitor the trade environment closely. While we\u2019re not immune to pressure in the broader environment, our teams are prepared for multiple scenarios importantly across the Company we have clarity of purpose under Ralph's unifying brand vision, focused strategic with aligned operational and financial goals, and the passion and commitment of our team around the world. We are delivering on our plan and will continue to drive executing that finds the balance between addressing short-term pressures while managing for the long term. As we look forward to fiscal 20, we remain confident in the full year outlook we presented at our investor day in June. This concludes positive top line growth in constant currency along with operating profit growth and margin expansion for the full year. We plan to provide more details on fiscal 20 guidance when we report our fiscal year end results in May. With that, let\u2019s open up the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. You may ask your question. Matthew Boss : Your 3Q print exceeded expectations in holiday season with clear winners and losers across retail. I guess Patrice, as you reflect on the quarter, what factors do you think helped deliver the outperformance? And then Jane, on the expense front, I guess maybe how best to think about the core leverage that you're seeing versus strategic marketing investment as we think going forward? Patrice Louvet : Listen, first of all, Ralph and I are really proud that our team has been consistently executing across all our sites of our new Next Great Chapter strategy. As we look at obviously quarter-to-quarter, there are some areas of businesses that are worth better that others, and we're clearly dealing with some level of volatility in the marketplace. But I have to say, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we made across several areas of this business this quarter. There are three things I would call out that enabled us to actually come ahead of where we expected for Q3. The first one is AUR. They were better than we expected across actually all regions and all channels. And this is really the result of continued focus we\u2019re putting on elevating the brand through improved marketing, improve engagement with our consumers, improve products and then the continuing efforts that we have on promotional pullback. We\u2019re able to drive high single digit, right. You've heard Jane talk about we were up 9% this quarter despite what we view as a more promotional environment this past holiday. Well, first driver AUR, second driver is digital momentum. Our digital momentum clearly accelerated across all of our digital sectors whether that's our own digital commerce site, wholesale.com or the digital pure players. Our overall digital ecosystem revenues this past were up 20%. One of the important factors that was an enabler for this was our transition to the new platform, you'll recall, last year, we moved North America to a new platform for our website and then Europe more recently. And this is really allowing us to provide better storytelling, better brand building, combined with better functionality and consumer experience and we seen that play out in the result. The third factor is Asia, right. I know there is lot of question marks what\u2019s happening in China and Asia in general, but our momentum continued in Asia. You've heard Jane talked about, we grew up 11% constant currency in total Asia, 4% comps led by greater China of 19%, led by Mainland China of close to 40%, but also continued strong performance from our more established markets Japan, Korea, and Australia. So, those are really the three key factors that enabled us to perform ahead of where we expected for the quarter. I will turn it over to Jane on\u2026 Jane Nielsen : Sure. On SG&A, Matt, in general our Q3 SG&A expenses were generally in line with our plan. But we had top line momentum that enabled us to proactively reinvest in the business. Meaningfully in marketing, where you saw our marketing increased 18% this quarter. And recall that's not half of a 27% increase that we did in Q3 last year. As I look forward to Q4, I don't expect that level of year-on-year marketing increases in the fourth quarter. We significantly increased our marketing over 15%. So that will be a dynamic change as you look going through into the fourth quarter. But consistent with our strategic growth initiatives, we made some proactive investments in the faster growing areas of our business. You heard Patrice talk about our 39 new stores that we opened and we made some important investments in digital. And this quarter we proactively worked to strengthen our digital capabilities including faster delivery times notably to the West Coast. Our test in L.A. shows that those are proving out and driving consumer demand. We also invested to make sure that we have 24/7 customer support capability. So those were notable in this quarter. I think you're asking a broader question in terms of, how are we looking at both short and long-term expense reductions? And what we called out this quarter, the reduction in our DC footprint is going to be an important -- and the inventory consolidation we're doing is going to be important part of our productivity as we move forward. We expect that to start to pay dividends as we look forward to FY '20. And we're also continuing the work that we're doing in indirect expenses. We're really systematically as we've done this year which helped us produce SG&A leverage, if you exclude marketing, we're really driving into every cost challenging every vendor contract looking for scale benefits, consolidation benefits and we do see that pay dividends as we move forward. So we continue to be as we confirmed our long-term guidance for '20 we continue to be optimistic, also opportunistic to believe that as we return to growth, you will SG&A leverage. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Michael Binetti : Jane, I guess, a couple of questions to help me unpack here further. As we look ahead the composition of revenues in the model here is going to be changing a little bit next year as you have the majority of this off-price pullback strategy done for example? AUR has been a big, big line item in the revenue growth line for a couple of years on the quality of sales work. Next year it seems like a couple of things will be a lot more on a like-for-like basis. How do you think -- how much do you think AUR should contribute here as the quality-of-sales initiatives may be slow? And what do you need from units or traffic to drive that low to mid single-digit growth you talked about on revenues? Jane Nielsen : Yes. Well Michael, it's a great question, because one of the tenets of our strategic plan is that AUR growth is a driver of our top line growth through our long-term plan. So I see lots of opportunity for us to drive what we guided to which was low to mid single-digit AUR growth. And the reason I have confidence in that is the drivers that we've seen over the last 2.5 years are relatively consistent. We've been able to drive AUR growth through a mix of some modest like-for-like pricing. We've been able to reduce discounts and we see that we have more opportunities there. And we've been able to mix into higher AUR and higher gross margin product. Those -- and the shift of our business international where we have higher AUR is also a tailwind benefit to AUR. So I'm very encouraged. I feel that AUR is what over delivered this quarter, but it's going to be durable as we move through our plan. The cutback in off-price does help us from an AUR perspective. It is that the -- AUR, it tends to be lower there. It tends -- we tend to move through more units there. So pulling back there is completely consistent with our plan of rising AUR fewer units which I think is also consistent with the elevation of the plan. Operator : The next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Alexandra Walvis : We had a question around the North America wholesale business. So outside of that off-price pullback it seems like the North America wholesale business was very strong. I wonder if you could dive a little bit more into the drivers of that? And then on the off-price rationalization, I wonder if you can help us out with how fast with that process you think that we are today? And how much longer we should expect that to go on and the pieces of that business in particular that are being reduced? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yes. So, Alexandra, in terms of what we saw in our wholesale trends, we really saw strength in the third quarter in some of our core categories notably in men's and notably in Polo. We saw good -- we saw benefits from reduced promotionality and accordingly better -- a reduction in our vendor allowances and natural margin increases. Those were really what we saw as core strengths in our North America wholesale business. Also our departmentstore.com business as we called out was particularly strong where we gained share again in key categories and saw strong high single-digit growth. We're also starting to overlap some of the significant door pullbacks that we made during our reset, and so we're seeing that play through. As I think about off-price pullback, it's significant in this second half as we've been calling out for a while. Our strategic goal, so as you think about it going forward is to really reduce the penetration of off-price to our total wholesale business. So I don't expect the pressure from off-price pullback to be as significant in FY '20 as it was in this year. But I do expect -- I don't expect it to be a leverage point as we reduce the percentage of penetration to our business. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. You may ask your question. John Kernan : Patrice going back to the 2000 -- to the Investor Day last year, the $500 million in incremental digital sales you certainly showed a lot of momentum this quarter particularly in North America with digital up 21%. Can you talk about some of the drivers going into next year in digital as you've repositioned the entire platform and how we should think about that going forward? Patrice Louvet : Yes. So as we kind of feel the -- and what drove the acceleration this past quarter and what's durable to use Jane's terminology which I like, it's really three factors. One is the work we're doing on brand building. And if you look at past quarter we did a lot around our 50th gift campaign, we obviously had our special limited editions whether that's Winter Stadium or the Palace program. So the brand building piece of the storytelling piece enhanced by the platform upgrade that we have will continue. We really -- continuously raised the bar on that particularly in the way that really connects with Gen Z consumers and Millennials. The second part is the consumer experience on our site. And we know we have a lot of opportunity to strengthen it. There's been good progress on functionality over the past quarter ranging from free shipping progress bar to monogramming services to a dedicated Polo shirt shopping experience. And then some of the technical elements of faster downloads of our pages, quicker delivery to consumers homes and so on. So we're going to continue raise the bar on consumer experience and functionality. And then finally as all the work we continue to do on quality of sales which was obviously a big enabler for AUR here, which continues to be an area of focus and I think will be for as long as we're in business. So for next 50 years which is an important part of the block, so that's our own fight, right, which is really we think of our own digital flagship which then needs to set the stone for how the brand shows up on other digital platforms. If you look at then the other platform, obviously there's wholesale.com, Jane touched on that in previous question where we're seeing good momentum, we have really good partnerships with our -- the key wholesale players. We will continue to build on that momentum where we can really connect well with the target consumers that shop there. Then there is pure play -- digital pure players. Right, around the world and we continue to build our stable, a select pure players that we partner with. For example we've spent on Stitch Fix with Polo women this past quarter in the U.S. and we continue to see good progress in Asia, in Europe with some of the key players there and obviously expanding our presence here in North America. So I think if anything -- that's going to accelerate. And then the final one is social commerce, right. The ability to shop through WeChat, the ability to shop through Instagram and so on and so forth which today is still relatively small on the -- if you look at total picture, but we expect that to accelerate significantly because the consumer benefit the ease-of-use there is just very compelling for our consumer target. So I think as we look at the key elements of our strategy, what we've been executing and what we need to execute moving forward we have confidence that we can continue to stay on this track of accelerated growth with digital commerce so that we can reach to $0.5 billion that we called out for the full five-year period. Jane Nielsen : Yes. John just as Patrice mentioned, we're really happy with the underlying momentum we see in our digital commerce site. In North America, I'll just recall this is the quarter that we overlapped that site conversion. So from a trajectory run rate perspective it's somewhat anomalous. But we feel really good about the factors that Patrice noted and the momentum it suggests for our e-commerce business. Patrice Louvet : And then maybe one additional element which we actually didn't touch on, which is our new mobile app, particularly as we think we're bringing in new consumers, younger consumers into the brand. We launched our mobile app little less than two quarters ago. Half of the consumers coming through the app are actually Gen Z or Millennials. We are seeing very strong engagement rates. We are seeing fantastic sell-through of our special editions there. I encourage all of you to sign up if you haven't yet, but that's also an important asset that we have in our digital commerce toolbox that is just at the very early stages. So I think also a very promising potential there. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Paul Trussell : I just wanted to touch base on your international performance. As you are well aware a lot of global macro concerns over the last few months, and while the European business did have some timing elements to it, it really outperformed, certainly versus my expectations. And you also already have mentioned Asia a few times. Maybe just give a little bit more color about what you feel is driving those top line results outside of the Americas? Patrice Louvet : Yes. So maybe let's start the tour in Europe, where we did as -- overall delivered strong performance in Europe. We're obviously keeping a close eye on the various developments there, whether that's the uncertainty around Brexit whether those are the demonstrations going on in Paris, those at this point has not had an impact on our business. We are actually feeling good about our performance in Q3 and what we are able to do moving forward. What's important to note Paul on this is for Europe, as we're still quite underdeveloped from a retail presence standpoint right, we have 23 stores. I think a year ago when we talked on this call we had 19. So now we're moving, we are starting to open stores and build our digital ecosystem so that we have a compelling ecosystem in key cities there. So relative to our competitors, we're incredibly underdeveloped and then we believe we still we have significant growth opportunities even in the challenging context. So we're being careful, we're monitoring the environment, but we are confident we have a number of growth factors for us in the future. In Europe, particularly in markets like Germany and Southern Europe which is where the underdevelopment is greater. As far as Asia is concerned what's exciting for us across Asia is the broad-based growth, right. While of course China is doing well and we have significant opportunities there, we're seeing continued performance from our current key market in Asia which is Japan. We're seeing accelerated performance as the team applies the Japan formula to South Korea in South Korea and also in Australia. So it's broad-based. It's built on strong fundamentals. And so I would say, I think similar to Europe, there are a lot of question marks around China and a potential slowdown in China. We have not seen that on our business in Q3. And again we are our highly underdeveloped in China. Chinese consumer domestic sales and traveling -- travel sales are about 5% of our total business. So when you compare that to a number of our peers that are more in the 25%, 30%, 40% penetration, you can see the upside that we have on this business. And we -- while it's very early days, we're encouraged by the response we're getting both from a consumer standpoint there, the response we're seeing in how our Polo boutiques are performing, the response we're seeing as we work with various partners the Tmall Luxury Pavilion, JD Toplife and so on and so forth and that's pays WeChat more recently Golf society. So we're feeling encouraged that we've got the right elements and the right strategy to deliver growth in -- across Asia and therefore across international with what I mentioned for Europe. Jane Nielsen : I would just add Paul that we were really pleased in Europe, with the investments that we made in inventory in outlet paid off not only to return us to positive comp growth in our outlet business, but at a meaningful AUR increase. So the -- our strategy to restore into higher AUR products paid off. It paid off on the top line. It also flowed through with a nice pick up in our AUR in Europe. We expected the timing shift in our wholesale business in Europe. We knew that because we are aligning our calendars that Q3 was going to be quite strong. We called that out last quarter, but really pleased with the outlet performance that we saw in Europe. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. You may ask your question. Omar Saad : Jane I wanted you to see if you could elaborate on -- you mentioned the share inventory going live. I remember in the past you've talked about a test in L.A. marketplace test retailing in wholesale and retail -- on retail kind of the inventories to drive quicker replenishment, more articulated products and inventory planning. Could you elaborate on what you're working on there and what you see as the opportunity, that you kind of integrate omni-channel capabilities into the business? Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Sure. What we're seeing from our initiatives on shared inventory, right now, we're in the first phase of that which is the combination of our store, our ROS store inventory and our e-commerce inventory is a few benefits. One, it reduces inventory buffers. Two, it allows us to direct our inventory to the demand that has the highest selling price. So it's -- better full price selling, less inventory. It also speeds stick-times in our warehouse and reduces our need for warehouse footprint, which reduces our overhead costs. So lots of benefits there from a shared inventory. And we are working on the next phase which could be even greater inventory sharing across our channels which should also generate the same kind of benefits from an inventory full price sellout and cost reduction. We're very encouraged by the teams. We're working very hard on it and it went live this quarter. So more to come there and I'm sure that that will give us even more opportunities as we look forward on allocations and store close as well. Patrice Louvet : And then, yes, on the Los Angeles ecosystem project, so we're about a little more than six months in. The headline for -- my message Omar actually is L.A. is outperforming the North America region. So still early days in this pilot, but actually we're very pleased with the way the results are coming in. What we are seeing is shared gains across the market. What we are seeing is an acceleration of our digital commerce business actually very strong acceleration there. And then what we're also seeing which is quite positive is that we're attracting new younger consumers through the franchise. So this elevation of the brand presence across all the touch points whether that's wholesale or own stores, full price or factory, and then the emphasis we are putting on digital with some localized messaging at this point is really paying off. L.A. is a huge region, so we really want to take advantage of the upside opportunities that we have there. But the headline point at this stage is delivering well ahead of the nation. Operator : The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. You may ask your question. Jay Sole : Patrice, I wanted to ask you about your comments around winning over new generation. You gave a lot of great stats about how your initiatives have created a lot of impressions and a lot of buzz with Generation Z and Millennials. Just share with some of your plans to kind of keep that momentum going into Q4. The kind of things you have planned and if you can talk about how you're converting some of that initial interest that you're getting from younger people into that repeat purchase that you talked about? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So here is how we think about the strategy for winning over new generation. We've got four specific areas. One, is we want to be where the consumer group is consuming media right. So you -- you've seen over time how we're shifting our marketing to much more digital, much more social and that's where the majority of our spending is going now. All right so being where they consume media, the second is being where that consumer group is shopping and purchasing, which is the shift you're seeing that we're making toward digital commerce because we know they are disproportionately tough in that space. And the development of our app, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing through the app, much younger consumer coming into the brand. The third area, so those two are -- continue. The third area is how we leverage influencers that really connect with that target audience. Right, so just as an illustration, we talked about our latest Romance re-launch and the face of that fragrance is Taylor Hill who really appeals to the younger population incredibly effectively, and that's just an illustration of how we're thinking about building this mosaic of influencers that can represent all the dimensions of the brand and also connect nicely in the local markets with the target audience that we're going after. And then, the fourth one are these Limited Edition and drops, which we will continue to do. Obviously we'll keep an eye on it to surprise as part of the success is to surprise on that that comes with it. We're also very careful not to overdo it, because otherwise these things will run out of steam. We've been very intentional on how we paste it. But if you look at the results we've got behind Palace, 75% of the consumers who bought Palace were new to the Ralph Lauren brand. On average consumers who bought Palace were 10 years younger than the average consumer for Ralph Lauren. And we're also seeing that on Winter Stadium and others. And to your point and then on retention, one of the interesting and encouraging data points for us is if you look at the purchases of our drops, consumers who bought Winter Stadium, actually half of them had already brought a drop, a prior drop, right which gives us confidence that as we bring in consumers through these special activities, we're then able to keep a majority of them moving forward. So that's the broad framework that we have in place. We feel good about the progress we're making around that. And we're doing that while not forgetting our core, because our core consumers are also important part of the business. And so our job is to successfully appeal to this new group of consumer, while also delivering what our current consumers are looking for. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Company. You may ask your question. Rick Patel : I'll add, my congrats as well and thank you for squeezing me in here. Can you update us tour sales in the U.S. given the strong U.S. dollar? I'm curious if there was a change in trend versus last quarter and to what extent you think that helped fuel your performance in Greater China? And my second question is around department store refreshes. I believe you had about 80 or so of these refreshes last year and had planned to do more this year. Any updates on where you are with those and any call outs in terms of performance going forward? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Hi Rick. So for tourism based on the data that we collect we saw foreign tourist traffic in our doors was up about 2% in the quarter. You'll recall that in Q2 it was down about 2% and in Q1 it was flattish. So we're seeing this sort of flattish to down slightly, up slightly trends, in the U.S. In Europe we saw that our foreign tourist traffic was up about 3%. That was off a down 21% you recall in Q2. Again this is our data, with the overall composition remain in terms of foreign tourist from other countries remaining about consistent as we've looked from quarter-to-quarter. Patrice Louvet : And then on the door refreshes we're continuing that because we're very pleased with the results we've gotten so far behind the doors that we have upgraded. And I quoted earlier some of the progress we're seeing in Los Angeles which is obviously a key part of that. So we did 81 refreshes in fiscal '18, with just sales they were up double-digit, so this pay up -- paid up because actually the investment we're making is not that significant. A lot of it is improved lighting, improved layouts, fresher paint of code, better signage, better visuals but good returns on that. We've completed 103 refreshes in the first half of fiscal '19, and we plan to do a total about 150 this fiscal year, and continuing to do that to effect, over time we want to effect at least 50% of our total business, on the way the 75%, we're doing that in close partnership with our key wholesale partners including the largest one, and they've completed the first 50 and now they are onto the next 100. We're working that hand-in-hand with them. So encouraged by the progress, it continues to be a focus area as we want to elevate our brand as possible in a single touch point. All right Rick, well thank you. Thanks for all of you for joining the call today. As I hope you took away from this conversation in our press release we're encouraged by our progress and our results as we continue to elevate the iconic business Ralph as built with teams over the past 50 years. And as we continue to strengthen our connection to consumers around the world, and we look forward to sharing our fiscal year-end results in our fiscal year '20 guidance with you on the next call. So thanks for calling in and talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We're pleased to report fourth quarter and full year fiscal '19 results that delivered on our commitments with revenues, operating margin and double-digit EPS growth all coming in ahead of our outlook for both the quarter and the year. Our fourth quarter performance was driven by double-digit revenue growth in Asia and Europe on a constant currency basis and better-than-expected AUR growth globally. North America also made continued progress on returning to a healthier base with ongoing elevation of our brand and a planned reduction of our off-price channel penetration, though we recognize that we still have more work to do on this multiyear journey. On balance, our company outperformed on core metrics this year with several areas of our business delivering ahead of expectations and a few that require more work. Moving forward we're focused on leveraging the successes while also applying the learnings from this first year of our next great chapter strategic plan. As we close out fiscal '19, Ralph and I are proud of the work our teams have done this year. We're encouraged by the strong progress we've made on our strategic plan to deliver long-term, sustainable growth and value creation. In a moment, Jane will take you through the fourth quarter and fiscal '20 outlook, but first let me start by reviewing our fiscal '19 highlights across the five strategic priorities in our plan. As a reminder, these include first, win over a new generation of consumers. Second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Fourth, lead with digital across all activities and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. Starting with over new generation of consumers, as we outlined at Investor Day last June, our goal is to recruit millions of new consumers into our brands each year. To achieve that, we've been elevating our brand building content and increasing our marketing investment, with a focus on channels that matter most to consumers today namely, digital and social. In fiscal '19, we increased marketing spend by 13% on top of the 10% increase in the prior year. Highlights from the year and key learnings included, two unique fashion shows the generated record levels of global engagement from Ralph Lauren. We are creating differentiated experiences with our shows where we can engage consumers in new ways and amplify our messaging globally to in-store events and digitally. Our exciting collaboration with UK-based streetwear brand Palace and limited edition launches throughout the year, introduced the brand to new and younger consumers. As part of this, we activated our new POLO mobile app and partnered with influential specialty retailers around the world to reach trend savvy consumers where they shop. We continue to leverage the power of cultural events and influencers, notably Ralph's incredible custom designs for the wedding of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas in India and our successful exhibition at Intercept one of China's most innovative platforms for creatives from the world of art, food, fashion, and music. And lastly, our partnerships and high visibility with Wimbledon, US Open Tennis and the US team at the Ryder Cup, reinforced Ralph Lauren's authentic connection to the world of sports. As a result, we saw healthy growth in our number of Instagram followers with a 45% increase to last year to reach over 15 million followers across our brand handles. In the fourth quarter specifically, marketing highlights included our spring 2019 runway presentation, which transformed part of our Madison Avenue flagship into an immersive, provision-inspired Ralph's Coffee experience. We're also leveraging key categories like Fragrance to recruit a new generation of consumers. In Q4, we launched a new campaign around the iconic Ralph Lauren Romance fragrance, featuring our new global ambassador Taylor Hill. And just a few weeks ago, you may have seen our Family is Who You Love global campaign, which captures a modern take on family, however you define it. It is a positive and powerful message about inclusion that has resonated with consumers and across Global press. We are gaining traction with younger consumers as we engage with them in new, relevant, and exciting ways. We are in the early stages of this journey and are focused on building momentum among both millennial and Gen Z consumers globally. Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential under-developed categories. In the fourth quarter and fiscal year, we made progress on our long-term plan to drive roughly half of our revenue targets through growth in core product and the other half through the expansion of five under-developed categories. Our iconic and updated core styles continue to be a key driver of our top line performance. As Ralph and the design teams generate excitement in the marketplace. We continue to animate these core styles through the use of print, embroidery, color blocking, graphic POLO logos, our POLO bear and customization offerings. Moving to our under-developed categories that have significant growth potential across our brands. These include denim, outerwear, wear-to-work, footwear and accessories. Our performance in denim outerwear, which are the further developed of the five categories was encouraging this year, benefiting from an improved product, merchandising and distribution focus. Positive sales trends in these categories for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 indicated a strong consumer response to our new initiatives. Notably, outerwear growth accelerated as we move through the year, fueled by our focus on key programs such as core nylon, down, bomber and leather jackets. We were able to apply early learnings from this past winter's performance as we launched an expanded outerwear offering and coordinated marketing campaign for fall 2019. And while the accessories are expected to play a more meaningful role leader in our long-term plan, we were excited to introduce our RL50 collection hand back to the market this spring. Our newest merger classic Ralph Lauren style with modern sophistication and artisanal leather craftsmanship. These developments represent strong progress, but we still have work to do, particularly in product areas that are not yet performing to their potential. For example, a Lauren wholesale business in North America where we need to drive a greater focus on core categories and better balance core product with fashion. And while our core POLO products drove our performance, we have an opportunity to strengthen the appeal of our fashion concepts. We've already taken decisive action to address both of these areas with a new design direction and category strategy in place for Lauren, which should start to impact spring '20 and onward, and earlier adjustments in place on or POLO design concepts. Moving on to our third key initiative; drive targeted expansion in our regions, and channels. We are focused on building a cohesive brand-elevating Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale, and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. In fiscal '19 we opened 135 new stores and concessions globally and closed 85 locations. This included 94 openings in Asia with 39 in China, our fastest growing market. For the full year, greater China revenue was up 20% to last year in constant currency, representing about 3.5% of our total company revenue. This included more than 30% growth in Mainland China on top of the 25% growth we reported last year, driven by comp growth and new stores. In Europe, we opened four new full-price stores and two new factory stores on a net basis. We are still significantly underpenetrated at brick and mortar retail, with only 23-owned full price stores across Europe, and we continue to see a meaningful long-term opportunity to build out our ecosystem strategy in the region. Overall in fiscal '19 we track slightly behind our annual store openings target, as we remain highly selective on real estate locations to ensure that they elevate the brand and meet our profitability targets. Moving on to our fourth key initiative lead with digital. Our global digital business including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce was up 11% in constant currency in fiscal 2019, with strong performance across all regions led by international. Our directly operated North American digital flagship returned to positive growth during the year as planned. Comps grew 10% compared to a 22% decline in fiscal ' 18 as we lap last year's transition to cloud-based platform. Our directly operated European digital commerce sites also showed strong improvement following the move to our new platform this fiscal year. Comps were up 6% in the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, despite reduced promotional activity to elevate the brand. We also continue to drive strong performance with digital pure play partners across all regions this year. In the US, in the fourth quarter, we added distribution of Men's Polo the Essence a leading international fashion platform known for its curated selection of luxury and streetwear brands. We also expanded our presence on motor operandi with RRL and the [indiscernible] with Chaps. Internationally, we added 11 new wholesale digital partners in Europe in the quarter. Including specialty players that resonate with younger trend forward consumers like slamjamsocialism.com in Italy, and kicks.com in Germany. We also continue to expand our digital presence in Asia including enhancements to our WeChat, shop in shop, in China an exclusive online collaborations with high-profile partners in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong. While encouraged by our digital commerce momentum we see opportunities to accelerate growth of our total digital ecosystem and gain share. For example, by better leveraging our experience and assets in brand building and presentation from our own digital flagship we can apply our best practices with those of our partners to drive higher performance and productivity on wholesale.com. Let me touch on our fifth key initiatives, operate with discipline to show growth. In fiscal '19 we continue to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies as we progress towards a mid-teens operating margin target by fiscal '23. Adjusted operating expenses excluding marketing grew 1.4% below our top line growth for the year. This cost discipline enabled us to ramp up our marketing investments and expand our global retail presence, while increasing operating profit and operating margin above our guidance. Jim will provide more details on how we're continuing to drive productivity. I also wanted to give you an update on citizenship and sustainability the topic we care deeply about. Over the last six months we've undertaken a focused effort to evolve our strategy and further embed sustainability across our organization. In the coming months, we will share more about our approach to one; creating product, two; managing our environmental impact and three; how we champion and support our employees, the workers across our supply chain and our communities. One recent example of how we are bringing this to life in our products was the launch of the Earth Polo in April. The Earth Polo is made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and uses a waterless dyeing process. Early consumer reaction has been strong and we look forward to sharing more as we progress in this journey. And lastly we recently announced two key organizational changes to support our strategic initiatives going forward. Jane Nielsen's role was expanded the Chief Operating Officer in addition to Chief Financial Officer. And Howard Smith, who successfully led our international group was elevated to the role of Chief Commercial Officer at the end of March adding North America to his responsibilities. We expect these changes to enable faster re-application of proven successes. Both promotions are extremely well deserved and further highlight the strength of our leadership. In closing, this year's results demonstrate our progress on putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Elevating the brand and balancing growth and productivity to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Our recent global employee survey conducted by Korn-Ferry demonstrates accelerated levels of engagement versus the prior year that now surpass the high performing norm. It's our teams excellent execution that is moving us forward and Ralph, the leadership team and I are inspired and energized by them every day. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane and will join her at the end, to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice and good morning everyone. Our team's performance this quarter and throughout the year, returned our company to top line growth, while continuing to drive higher EURs, expand operating margin and return more cash to shareholders. It's a good start to our journey with a clear path on our work ahead. Fourth quarter revenues increased 1.2% in constant currency and were down 1.5% on a reported basis. Our international businesses delivered double-digit top line growth in constant currency, more than offsetting both the negative impact of the Easter shift into Q1 and our deliberate reduction in North America off-price sale. Adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 50 basis points in constant currency. Benefiting from reduced promotional activity and favorable product, geographic, and channel mix. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 6.4%, up 80 basis points on a reported basis and a 110 basis points in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 12% to last year. SG&A expense declined to 53.8% of sales, down from 54.2% last year, as we lap the acceleration in marketing investments made in the second half of FY'18. Marketing spend declined 8% to last year in the fourth quarter but was up 13% on a full-year basis as we focused on winning over a new generation of consumers. Our dollar spending levels in the fourth quarter were roughly similar through the last three quarters of fiscal '19. We continue to make progress toward our long-term objective of increasing marketing to about 5% of sales, while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goals. We closed the year with marketing at 4.3% of sale. Our teams are intensely focused on driving operating efficiencies across our business. Initiatives this year included consolidation of our distribution footprint from four buildings to two, in conjunction with the launch of our direct to consumer shared inventory in North America in the fourth quarter. This will enable us to reduce our overall inventories, maximize full price selling and lower our fulfillment and overhead costs in the future. We renegotiated over 80 vendor contracts to drive a 14% reduction in addressable expenses, generating savings without compromising quality. And we continue to simplify our organization to improve agility and empower our leaders. Moving onto segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 7% in the fourth quarter, adjusted operating margin was 15.9% with a 150 basis point decrease to last year, as modest gross margin expansion was more than offset by SG&A deleverage on negative retail comps. In the retail channel in North America, comps declined 4% in constant currency, including about 300 basis points of negative impact from the Easter shift into the first quarter of fiscal '20. Our directly operated digital commerce business was up 6% with strong double-digit AUR increases, partly offset by the Easter shift. Bricks and mortar comps were down 7%, modestly lower than our trends earlier in the fiscal year, largely driven by challenging traffic with foreign tourist traffic down 5% versus a 7% increase in the prior year. In our stores, we had positive AUR growth this quarter, but at a more moderated rate than in prior quarters. We still expect about a three-point shift in comp into Q1 due to Easter. Moving on to North America Wholesale. Fourth quarter revenue was down 10% more than half of the decline was due to a planned reduction in off-price sales. As we have previously noted, we are strategically repositioning off-price back towards its original purpose as an excess inventory clearance fee. We will continue to pragmatically manage our off-price penetration down within our broader wholesale channel excluding off-price, our underlying North America wholesale business was down low-single digits in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the strength in our core products and are rightsizing our buys in select fashion oriented product. We continue to monitor selling trends carefully and expect some ongoing volatility quarter-to-quarter. Our North American digital ecosystem including ralphlauren.com, wholesales.com, and digital pure plays was up slightly in the fourth quarter, negatively impacted by the Easter shift, and was up high-single digits for the full year, as we returned to growth on our own digital commerce site. Our teams are working with our digital wholesale partners to strengthen our brand imagery, storytelling and assortments to better realize the growth in this digital channel. Moving on to Europe, fourth quarter revenue was up 4% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margins expanded 360 basis points on a reported basis and 340 basis points in constant currency. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage on top line growth. In the retail channel in Europe, comps were up 5% in constant currency, driven by a 6% increase in our owned digital commerce sites and a 5% increase in our brick and mortar stores. Similar to last quarter, the sequential improvement in our brick and mortar comp trend was primarily driven by our outlet investment to get back into inventory positions, improve the breadth and depth of our product assortment and drive strong AUR growth. The 6% comp growth in our directly operated European Digital Commerce business was also in line with our expectations, benefiting from platform enhancements and more targeted performance marketing. On our sites, we saw strong quality of sales improvements, double-digit growth in traffic, and high single-digit AUR increases, driven by positive consumer response to our new platform. Across our Europe direct to consumer channels, our ongoing effort to improve quality of sales continued with AUR up 8% in the fourth quarter. Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 11% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Despite a planned shift in the timing of shipments into the third quarter, which negatively impacted Q4 Europe wholesale revenues were ahead of our guidance, reflecting the benefit of modest distribution growth with existing wholesale partners. Turning to Asia, revenue was up 7% on a reported basis and 10% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. We saw a strong performance across every market, including 30% constant currency revenue growth in Mainland China. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region, and we continue to increase our digital efforts, expanded and elevate our store fleet, and engage with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 4% in constant currency, driven by 10% AUR growth and positive traffic. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we invest in our distribution network, and increase our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. Adjusted operating margin was down 90 basis points to last year, as SG&A leverage was more than offset by gross margin contraction due to increased inventory reserves, primarily on select fashion concepts in the quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is strong and we return capital to shareholders, reflecting our continued operating progress. We ended the year with about $2 billion in cash and investments and 689 million in total debt. Which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $596 million in debt at the end of fiscal '18. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we repurchased $470 million in shares during the year. Including dividends and share repurchases we returned over $660 million to shareholders in fiscal '19, up from $162 million last year. We will continue to opportunistically buyback stock with about $600 million in repurchases plan for fiscal '20. we also raised our annual dividend by 10% to $2.75 for fiscal '20. On top of a 25% increase last year. Moving on to inventory. At the end of fiscal '19, inventory was up 7% to last year, moderating from 11% increase in the third quarter. Similar to the last two quarters, our inventory growth reflects strategic actions to support the following. One, early receipt of goods to maximize full price selling; two, comp growth; three, new retail distribution; and four, getting back to normalized inventories in our Europe factory stores, and we continue to reduce our air freight to lower shipment costs. Looking ahead, we expect inventories in the first quarter of fiscal '20, to be similar to our fourth quarter trend up high-single digits. As we anniversary our inventory initiatives in the first half, we will leverage shared inventory and a more unified buying process to better align inventory to demand. We are also taking a more cautious approach to inventories, especially in light of the dynamic trading environment. The tariffs enacted to date have a limited impact on our business, but our teams are prepared for multiple scenarios and have accelerated the diversification of our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of any potential tariff outcomes. Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and the first quarter of fiscal '20. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges, and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility for macroeconomic and geopolitical events. For full year fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up 2% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our long-term plan. At current spot rates, foreign currency is expected to have about a 90 basis point to 100 basis point negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal '20. We expect continued growth in our international businesses and stabilization in North America. We expect operating margin for fiscal '20 to be up 40 basis points to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven by a combination of modest gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal '20. We expect the magnitude of gross margin expansion to be more modest than last year due to higher input costs, pressure from transactional FX, and more normalized benefits from channel and geographic mix shifts. We expect modest SG&A leverage as we balance our productivity initiatives with investments in growth. For the first quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be up 3% to 5% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 190 basis points to 200 basis points in the quarter. The timing of Easter shift from the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 is expected to benefit North America retail comps by about three points in the first quarter. Operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be up about 30 basis points to 50 basis points to last year in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have roughly 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in the quarter. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $300 million in fiscal '20, focused on consumer facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return, including stores, and digital, as well as our corporate office consolidation project. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '20 to be approximately 22% above our fiscal '19 adjusted rate of 21%, driven primarily by our expected mix shift of international earnings into some higher tax jurisdictions. First quarter of fiscal '20 tax rate is estimated at about 19%. In closing, as we continue on our next great chapter journey we have a clear sense of purpose and are guided by Ralph's timeless vision. We are applying the insights we gained as we accelerate wins and navigate challenges. While we recognize the progress is not always linear, our teams are passionate, highly engaged and focused on delivering across all our strategic priorities and creating value for the long term. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Ike Boruchow : Hi, good morning, everyone, and congrats on a great year. I guess, one -- first question for Patrice. As you reflect on the first year of the next great chapter plan. I guess my question is, how are you feeling about the long-term strategy one year-end? Maybe could you go on. Let us know, little bit more about where you think you've outperformed versus maybe underperformed versus prior expectations and any need to revise any of the information you gave us at the Analyst Day and then, a quick one follow-up for Jane. North America wholesale would love a little bit more detail on how to think about Q1 and the rest of the year, tying together the off-price pullback, spring fashion softness that you highlighted for 4Q. Just any other color on that channel would be great? Patrice Louvet : Hey, good morning, Ike. So I guess on the first part of your question. Overall, we are actually pleased with what we delivered in year one of our next great chapter plan. While there's of course always more work to do, we believe our strategy is working and our plan is on track. So as a result, we remain very comfortable with the five-year targets we laid out last June at Investor Day. To your point on wins and opportunities, let me just touch on a few on both sides. So in terms of the things that we -- key highlights in terms of performance, one is we returned to growth a year ahead of plan and more importantly, we actually achieved this with a continued focus on profitable, quality growth, right? And you can see that through the progress that we've made on AURs throughout the fiscal year of high-single digits and through the continued expansion in operating margins throughout the year as well. Second thing I would highlight is the fact that we've significantly increased our brand-building investment, with a strong focus on social and digital to really elevate the brand, energize the brand, and win over a new generation for our first strategy. The third area to highlight is, I think, terrific work by Ralph, the design team and the overall organization on strengthening our core product, which has been a very important driver of the top line improvement over the past year. And then fourth and final point in terms of highlights is the digital space and the expansion space. So we completed the digital platform upgrades for our flagships in North America and in Europe, we launched our flagship in China. Both Europe and North America businesses insected back to positive comps this year after a few challenging years. We also drove in the digital commerce space expansion on digital pure players around the world, and you've heard some examples in our prepared remarks. And then of course we continue our international expansion, with a deliberate focus on China and we're really pleased with the acceleration we're seeing in China, delivering 30% growth in Mainland China this year. So those are key highlights. Key areas as we look at what are the learnings and what do we need to double down on moving forward, I'd call out three. One is we want to accelerate our momentum on winning over new generation. We had a strong 50th anniversary year, we gained traction with new and younger consumers I think millennials and Gen Z. We plan to continue building on this momentum into fiscal year '20 and beyond. With increased investments, better targeting, and stronger digital amplification of our programs. Second point to highlight is we need to improve traffic at our US brick and mortar stores. I think that's a consistent challenge for the industry here. So in addition to enriching the shop -- the shopping experience and enhancing our product offering, we need to better leverage our marketing programs and our ecosystem approach, our omnichannel ecosystem approach, to drive brick and mortar traffic. And then the third point I would highlight, is we have opportunities on products. So as I mentioned, this year we've had notable successes with updates to our core products. We also had some really nice sweet consumer reactions on our limited addition releases which we're going to continue to drive moving forward. However, we'll also have some gaps that we called on in our prepared remarks and as you heard we're full on focus on actioning those aggressively. But all in all, we're pleased with the way the first year played out and really in the right now it's about running the play as we move forward. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Ike just on the -- on your question on North America Wholesale. You saw us come out of the year with our full price wholesale business down in the low single digits. As I think about the coming year, our focus is really to get back to stabilize that business really as Patrice called out focus on the wholesale.com business for growth. And as I think about the mix of full price and off-price to stabilize the full price, but off-price will continue to be down throughout the year on a more normalized flow basis, but you will see modest declines, modest to moderate declines, in the off-price business throughout the year, but on a more stable basis. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Matthew Boss : Thanks. Maybe on the margin front. Could you just help outline the gross margin puts and takes this year relative to the 30 to 50 basis points annual expansion outlined in the five-year plan? And maybe just walk through some of the drivers behind the return to SG&A leverage this year? Jane Nielsen : As we look at the coming year in terms of gross margin, we expect about half of our operating margin leverage will come from gross profit. The drivers or our tailwinds are really pretty stable. The largest driver has been our pricing activity and our reductions in promotion. that will continue. What you'll see is a moderation of the benefit that we're seeing from channel mix, as our wholesale business will -- our focus is on stabilization and a moderation of the benefit of geographic mix, those are two will still remain tailwinds. But because North America, our expectation is stabilization and that performance, those benefits will start to moderate versus what you saw this year. Our headwinds that we see coming forward are that we will have some transactional pressure in our gross margin this year. Product cost that you saw as realized in the fourth quarter will continue notably into the first half. Some of those pressures and then we are taking a more cautious approach to inventory and so there will be some slight pressure from inventory actions that we're taking that will impact our overall COGS. As we look to SG&A overall, we have -- we are going to continue on our journey of cost discipline. We've had very good results from the cost leadership committee that we've established and we're continue to go against our indirect expenses. You've seen as it takes some significant distribution actions, consolidating our footprint, working on some of our automation within our distribution sites, consolidations of inventory, those will help from an SG&A's perspective. We're also consolidating our corporate headquarters, which will be a slight pressure points this year, but will be a leverage point into the future. And we're also leveraging more digital technology, leaning into digital design in our design teams, digital sample making. Those are the initiatives that are helping us get to SG&A leverage on top line growth of 2% to 3% in constant currency. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from of the Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. You may ask your question. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Congrats Jane on your additional responsibilities. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Laurent. Laurent Vasilescu : Jane, I believe you talked about 80 vendor and renegotiated contracts in the fourth quarter that drove a 14% reduction in addressable expenses. Can we parse out the dollar benefit in the fourth quarter and will these cost initiatives flow through for the balance of the quarters in FY '20? Jane Nielsen : The part of what I just talked about in terms of the cost leadership committee, those renegotiated expenses re -- contracts resulted in a 14% decrease in those contracts. But you will see that benefit and it's part of our SG&A leverage story as we move forward. And of course, we're not done. Those 80 contracts are just the beginning. We intend to review all of our contracts, obviously prioritizing the largest ones and the ones that are at expiry point first. But this is an ongoing effort for us. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question please? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Michael Binetti : Hey guys, good morning. So thanks for taking our question, Jane let me ask you on the operating margin guidance for this year in U.S. dollars takes you pretty close to 12% next year. So very good progress obviously but if we think back to the Analyst Day when you gave us the range of mid-teens and if I just interpret that as 15% as one of those scenarios that would need about 100 basis points per year after this year to get to that range which is obviously an inflection in the margin improvement rate after this year, what you think is required in the business at this point to get to that scenario to see the operating margins accelerate in the out years? Jane Nielsen : So several things, one is continuing our journey on gross margin expansion which you'll see us do this year and which we successfully did last year and a big part of that is continuing the AUR journey that we\u2019re on. This is an AUR led strategy and we've made good -- terrific progress on that really in FY 2019 with our AUR up 8%. So we have to continue that. We will also see accelerated leverage notably on SG&A which we called out in Investor Day as we continue to move through to top line growth and comp growth is an important part of that story. Another part of that story is also the new doors that we\u2019re opening which have higher productivity and higher four-wall margins. So it does come online and stabilize, you'll see those be accretive overall to our operating margin expansion as well. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Michael Binetti : And if I could just\u2026 Jane Nielsen : Sure. Patrice Louvet : Go ahead, Michael. Michael Binetti : Sorry, so if I can ask a little bit more near-term on the gross margin outlook for how we should think about it for the first quarter given your fourth quarter, I think was a little bit below prior quarters. But obviously against a big, big comparison a year-ago and then you had some noise from I think an outsized off price pullback that I would have thought would have been a tailwind, I guess to gross margins in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m just trying to take the puts and takes we have in the fourth quarter and roll it forward to how you're thinking about first quarter? Jane Nielsen : So as we think about first quarter, first of all we had a fantastic quarter in AUR growth this quarter. As we think about our guidance moving forward, we don't think it's prudent in this environment to guide to the kind of AUR growth of 8% roughly that we achieved this year into the future. So our AUR growth is more moderated and in line with the Investor Day guidance that we gave of low to mid single digit growth. So that's one factor. And then the other factor is in the first half, we do have more product cost pressures that you saw come into line in the fourth quarter, move into the first and second quarters in terms of gross margin expansion. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Kate Fitzsimons : Yes, hi. Good morning. I guess my question would be going back to the Investor Day, you guys spoke to $500 million in incremental digital sales seems like that business took a step back in here at the fourth quarter. But sounds like maybe that was due in part to the Easter shift. Can you just talk about some of the drivers into fiscal 2020 on digital and how we should think about the trajectory of that business going forward? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure, sure. Good morning, Kate. Listen, the general direction has not changed which is we expect low double-digit growth from our digital commerce business year-on-year to get to the target that you mentioned. And again digital commerce for us is our own site. Its wholesale.com, it\u2019s pure players and that is social commerce and we're seeing social commerce obviously accelerate. As you look at our performance this past quarter, optically, it may look like a slowdown, but actually, it is not a slowdown, this is completely consistent with our expectations. The Easter shift in North America is really the explanation between the 6% comp we delivered and the high single digit number that we look to deliver quarter-to-quarter, we estimate again the Easter shift is worth about 300 basis points. So very consistent with what we expected, very consistent with our run rate. There are a few things that we actually drove this quarter which should help sustain this type of performance in the area of functionality for our site that may be worth calling out here, relative to search suggestions, our checkout process we're driving greater availability of personalization across a broader range of products and we're also implementing or we have implemented Apple Pay and PayPal Express payment methods to the U.S. side and we're going to continue to raise the bar on functionality, on product and on brand building. So I think you should expect continued performance around high single digits from a North America site. And then in Europe, Europe is also in line with expectations. We're actually particularly pleased with the contributions of our Spanish sites. First time, we have a Spanish language site which launched a few months ago and so Europe is on a mid single digit trajectory. That's what we delivered in Q4, that's what we expect to deliver moving forward as well. And likewise here, we've also made a number of improvements to our site whether that's enhanced paper click, optimizing our search engine and then also localizing our sites in Italy and Greece and Netherlands and in Poland to make sure that whatever we offer really resonates with the local consumer. Then finishing the global tour, Asia is a very small business as far as our own site is concerned. So not material here but we were pleased with the results that came through. So all in all, looking ahead we\u2019re still very much in line with what we called out for the $0.5 billion of digital commerce progress over the next few years and Q4 came in consistently with our expectations and we expect to drive this in fiscal year 2020 as well. Jane Nielsen : And I would just add Kate for a comment that in Q4, we saw the highest AUR growth across our digital, our own digital e-commerce platforms that we saw throughout the year. So consistent with what Patrice shared on Easter but very positive in terms of AUR growth. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my question. Nice job this quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the shared inventory. Maybe give us more details on what\u2019s really coming online there, how it works, how the consumer will experience the benefits of shared inventory, what's the opportunity to the extent you have an idea and then maybe also if you could give a little bit more detail on your comments. Patrice on Lauren and Polo fashion, what needs to be done there? Thanks. Jane Nielsen : So shared inventory, from a consumer perspective it\u2019s a benefit to the consumer because we will have less out of stocks, we'll have better management of our inventory and more fluidity to be able to service our e-commerce customers and flow to the stores from a larger stock of inventory. So that's the net benefit to the consumer, for us the benefit is also that we can prioritize inventory to the highest price selling, so we'll realize more full price selling. We're bringing all the inventory into our one distribution center that is serviced by an automatic -- automated sorter, so we are getting some fulfillment benefits from the leverage of that automation. So that's a benefit for us. And it also reduces pick times because we have shared pick pools, we can reduce the transit time as we go into picks and that's also a labor benefit for us. So we're quite encouraged with about it. The number one advantage is for the consumer but we also think that there are both operational savings and pricing advantages from shared inventory. We are early in our journey, we went live in Q4, we're happy with the start but we expect that to pick up steam as we move through the year. Patrice Louvet : And then on the product points Omar, let me start with Lauren. So Lauren what we're talking about, what we talked about in the prepared remarks is really Lauren Women's business actually our Men's business is doing well and that's the combination on the women's side of sportswear, dresses and accessories. And why we're seeing good performance around the world, we are seeing softness specifically driven by our North America wholesale business. Though as we kind of look at where the brand stands today, we actually feel good about the Lauren positioning and aesthetic, right? We believe that that can actually resonate with consumers. The key causes of the Lauren challenges that we're seeing are first on the product front, we need to focus more on the core categories that the Lauren brand is known for and that our consumers care about and expect. So that means greater focus on knits, greater focus on denim, athleisure and dresses. There's a category choice here that that we need to pivot on. And then the second point is that we need to strike a better balance between core and fashion and our assessment is we've probably skewed too much towards fashion in recent seasons and need to rebalance that. And then on the distribution front as you know Lauren is primarily in the U.S. a department store brand. And so we're focused on improving Lauren in this channel. We want to gain share, the definition of success for us is gaining share there. And part of the work we're doing is also elevating the brand presentation, investing in our shopping shops. So that we can create a more engaging and energizing environment. And then again getting the product balance right in those environments. So what are we doing about? First of all, we actually have a new design team in place that we put in place a few months ago and this is a team that we believe really understands the DNA of the brand well as well as target consumer that we're going after. They're really focused on rebuilding the key classifications that the consumer is looking for from Lauren Women's starting with dresses and denim, we're also looking at diversifying distribution. So while we want win in wholesale and we want to grow share there, we also want to better balance out our distribution for Lauren as we've done in other parts of the world. So there's work going on in that area. And then finally, there's always more work to do in understanding the consumer that we target both making sure we're serving our current consumer base well and also having engaging and inspiring plans for the new consumers that we want to target. So that's where we stand on Lauren. The plans are being activated and as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we expect to see the impact of these plans as early as Spring 20. As far as the seasonal fashion concepts are concerned, let me quickly define and to make sure we all have a common understanding of what we're talking about here. So we introduced new concepts which are a sort of theme capsule each season along with our core product and in order to inject newness and excitement to our overall presentations. We believe this is an important part of attracting new consumers to the brand. Now with these themed concepts, there's obviously a high fashion risk component because it's about fashion, right. And sometimes you get it right and sometimes they don't necessarily work as intended. We've picked up in some of our recent seasonal fashion concepts is they've been actually resonating really well with our more trend forward consumers. But they haven't been as appealing to our broader population. And so the insight for us here is that we actually need to better balance. The focus on core which as you heard us talk about has been doing very well for us, and it\u2019s obviously the heart of this company and putting more emphasis on core and deemphasizing the focus, we've had on these seasonal fashion concepts. We still need them, we still want them but we were going to put less emphasis on them and get the balance right between the two. So that activation is already happening and you'll start to see the impact of that in our fall 2019 products and obviously going forward. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Last question please? Operator : Thank you. The last question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Paul Lejuez : Hey thanks. I just want to have a quick follow-up on your AUR comments, I'm curious if you could provide any color in terms of what you expect by region this upcoming year from an AUR perspective and then just second you mentioned, I think the decline in the tourist traffic might have had an impact on your retail business. I'm just curious if you were happy with how that business is trending with little local customers, how you feel about the outlet business just in general? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure, why don't I take those three components in order and just in terms of AUR, we don't guide necessarily by region, so we don't guide AUR by regions. But I can tell you that we saw over delivery in terms of expectation in both Asia and Europe. That was meaningfully a part of the over delivery that we had for the year in terms of AUR growth. We expect that over the course of this year that they will be more in line with our mid single digit AUR growth guidance that we gave for the long-term and that really is one of the biggest changes we have from FY 2019 going into FY 2020. We think that's prudent. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to drive AUR. We\u2019re certainly going to lean into it but we don't think it's prudent right now given the current environment to guide to a much higher AUR growth above our long-term guidance. On the foreign tourists side, we saw that in foreign tourism it was distinctly different. As you can imagine in North America and in Europe, in North America we saw foreign tourist traffic down 5%, last year at this time it was up 7%. It's been quite choppy through the year and it's been hovering around flat. Last quarter we saw it up 2% and ended the year about down 1%. It really flows that we see the biggest driver is foreign currency. So with the strengthening of the dollar, if that outcome was not surprising. In Europe, we saw foreign traffic up 8%. We do believe that that benefited our outlet comp in addition to the investments that we made to get back into inventory and the breadth of supply, we're very happy with the results that we've seen there and that we put up today. But Europe was really a sequential story in terms of foreign tourism, it was down double-digits in the first half and up mid single digits and ending up high single digits as we closed out the year but was down 6% for the year. Overall, as I look at our outlet business across North especially across North America because that's where I think you saw some pull back that was a little bit below where we expected. Certainly the foreign tourist traffic that we just called out was a factor in that. We also called out some of the products softness that occurred in Lauren and we think we have some price balancing opportunity to make sure that we have some good opening price points and clearance balance for our more price sensitive consumer. We're on it. We\u2019re enhancing our marketing initiatives including window signage and targeted emails to make sure that we can address traffic which is the biggest metric that we're focused on as we move forward. And of course from a product perspective, we\u2019re looking at our execution in the Lauren brand as we speak knowing that some of our pre-Spring concepts need to be addressed and we're balancing the assortment as we speak from an opening price point in clearance balance perspective for our more value sensitive consumers. So we see it, we are happy with that business, it's a great margin business and we think we know what we need to do to make sure that we're back on track as we move forward. Patrice Louvet : Good, well listen thank you everyone for joining our call today. As I think you've probably heard, we're encouraged by our progress on our results as we continue to elevate the iconic business Ralph and our teams have built over 50 years as we continue to strengthen our connections to consumers around the world. We've got clear strength and momentum that we want to build on. We also have opportunities that we need to go and address that we're all focused on and we look forward to sharing our first quarter fiscal 2020 results with you in late July. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you Cori. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We delivered first quarter results in line with our overall expectations including better than expected operating margin and double-digit EPS growth. Our performance this quarter was driven by strong continued momentum in our international markets both Europe and Asia and expense discipline across the organization. At the same time we continued to invest in elevating our brands and stabilize our North America business against a more volatile backdrop.  As we indicated at the start of this fiscal year we are monitoring the global retail environment closely particularly around trade and macro conditions. Our teams remain intensely focused on managing through potential industry headwinds and executing on our strategic plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. The three principles underlying this work include putting the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevating the brand, and balancing growth and productivity. During the first quarter we continue to drive our performance against the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five year plan. These include first, win over new generation of consumers; second, energized core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; four, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. In the first quarter we increased marketing investments by 19% to last year. We continued to shift our spend to channels that matter most to consumers today namely digital and social. Our key marketing initiatives this quarter centered around our Earth Polo launch, our new family campaign, and key sporting events that have cultural resonance and global appeal. In April we launched our Earth Polo made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and a waterless dyeing process. While the launch marked an important early step in our long-term sustainability efforts, it is only the beginning of our journey which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. The product generated a strong consumer response and the campaign had a meaningful impact from a marketing perspective with over a 1 billion earned media impressions globally and strong social media attraction. We also launched our Family is Who You Love global campaign in April, a positive and inspiring celebration of inclusion in modern families however you define them. This combined with our pride campaign and capsule collection in June also drove over a 1 billion media impressions globally. We kicked off our summer sports program with the golf majors including a special capsule collection with Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador Justin Thomas. And more recently you may have seen our high impact activations around Wimbledon where we are the official outfitters. We launched an integrated global campaign in July combining Wimbledon heritage with Gen Z activations including a YouTube series, our first gaming experience, an in-store and on site events with influencers, celebrities, and top clients. We have more exciting initiatives still to come including the U.S. Open Tennis Championships next month. We continued our partnerships with celebrities and influencers globally in the quarter. You may have seen Jennifer Lopez in the Ralph Lauren at the CFDA Awards this June as she collected the fashion icon award. Ralph Lauren earned the highest media impact value across all brands from the event according to the CFDA. We also announced JLo's fianc\u00e9 Alex Rodriguez as the new face of our Polo Blue fragrance. Other celebrity dressing this quarter included Selena Gomez at Coachella, Emma Roberts, Oprah, J.J. Lynn and K-pop band BTS. And lastly you may have seen that Ralph received honorary knighthood from Great Britain in June in recognition of his extensive philanthropic efforts, influence on global style, and longtime love of British heritage and culture. Ralph is the first American designer to receive this honor which garnered worldwide media attention. It was a very special moment for Ralph, his family, and all of us at Ralph Lauren. Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential under developed categories. We continue to drive our product assortment across three different areas which for clarity we are defining as core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion. Core includes iconic Ralph Lauren styles like the classic mesh polo shirt, Chino pants, army jacket, cable knit sweater, or Oxford button down shirt. Seasonal core products are iterations of our core items that are animated with fresh seasonal color ways or finishes. And seasonal fashion consists of more fashion oriented and embellished products that center around a seasonal theme or collection. This includes our limited edition series that deliver newness and excitement.  In Q1 our core and seasonal core styles resonated well across channels and continued to be a key driver of our top line performance. We're excited about the work Ralph and the design teams have done to reenergize the heart of the business. These styles are not only appealing to existing consumers but also to new and younger consumers. As we discussed last quarter we are working to get the mix right across these three product categories for each channel better aligning to consumer demand. In Q1 we took clear actions to focus our teams on the strategic rebalancing.  First, we expanded the scope of our experienced international merchant team to lead a new global merchandising effort that now includes North America. This team is now leveraging their proven track record of sharply aligning buys to consumer demand and successfully targeting a new younger consumer to the North American market. Second, our design teams have increased our penetration of core and seasonal core versus seasonal fashion products to focus on our most productive and appealing styles starting with our spring 2020 collections. While our penetration of seasonal product will become more balanced we will continue to leverage these propositions along with our special projects and limited edition capsules like this quarter's Polo Sport to bring newness and excitement to the marketplace.  Moving through our five high potential underdeveloped categories that have significant growth potential across our brands, these include denim, outerwear wear, wear to work, footwear, and accessories. We saw strong continued momentum this quarter in denim and outerwear which were the furthest developed of the five categories. Sell in and sell out trends for both categories exceeded total company performance. Based on an encouraging launch last fall we are rolling out an expanded presentation of outerwear at our own DTC and wholesale channels for Fall Winter 2019. Touching on product pricing which Jane will address in more detail in her prepared remarks, our total direct to consumer AUR was up 1% in the first quarter on top of a strong 8% increase in the first quarter of last year. While still positive this moderation primarily reflects the steps we are taking to reduce our disproportionate seasonal fashion inventory in North America.  Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. As we previously discussed we are building a cohesive brand elevating Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale, and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. During the first quarter we opened 21 new stores and concessions globally and closed nine locations. This included 13 openings in Asia with seven in Greater China, our fastest growing market. Our eco system approach continued to drive strong growth in Greater China in the quarter with sales up 12% the last year in constant currency including nearly 30% growth in Mainland China driven by comp growth and new stores. In Europe we opened four owned and partnered full price stores and two factory stores. While we are making good progress we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 36 full price stores across Europe. Moving on to our fourth key initiative lead with digital. Our global digital eco system including our directly operated sites, department store dot-com, pure players, and social commerce increased 1% in the first quarter in constant currency. Strong growth of nearly 10% in international was partly offset by mixed results in North America. Across international we continued to expand our distribution notably with digital pure players. In Asia we added two exciting new digital partners in the first quarter, ZALORA in Southeast Asia and the social commerce platform of Kakao, the largest messaging platform in Korea. In Europe we added six new wholesale digital partners in the quarter. These included Browns Fashion, a key specialty player that resonates with younger trend leading consumers and curated luxury retailers Fenwick both in the UK. Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw strong momentum delivering 22% comp growth this quarter. Turning to North America, our overall digital eco system in this market performed below our expectations in the quarter. Very strong double-digit growth in digital pure players was more than offset by softer trends on Ralph Lauren and Wholesale Dot Com. First starting with digital pure players, we continued to see strong momentum with partners who are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the first quarter we launched men's polo on PacSun.com and men's and women's polo on ASOS. We also added distribution of women's polo to Rent the Runway joining Lauren and Club Monaco on that platform which resonates with our target next generation consumer.  Second, comps in our own North America digital site were flat. Softness was primarily driven by a decline in sales to international consumers on our U.S. site due to FX headwinds and increased import regulations in key Asian markets and select underperforming products within Lauren in men's polo seasonal fashion styles. And lastly North America Wholesale.com was also weaker than expected driven primarily by the product issues we discussed on Lauren similar to Q4 trends. North America digital commerce is clearly an area of intense focus for us as we work toward consistently delivering our long-term target of low double-digit digital growth globally. Under our new global merchandising effort we've taken decisive action to rebalance our assortments and expect these changes to start flowing through in the back half of fiscal 2020.  Let me touch on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to fuel growth. We continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margin expansion of a 110 basis points exceeded our expectations driven by disciplined expense management and SG&A leverage. This cost discipline enabled us to continue expanding our marketing investment and global retail presence while increasing operating profit and operating margin.  And lastly I'd like to touch on the citizenship and sustainability strategy we launched in June which we call Design the Change. Our strategy and accompanying report represent our commitment to create more sustainable products, reduce our overall environmental footprint across our operations, and support and empower our teams and partners around the world. We introduce 16 key citizenship and sustainability goals that touch every area of our business and drive accountability across our organization. Key targets we expect to reach by 2025 range from reducing water usage by 25% across our operations and value chain to achieving gender parity within our leadership at Ralph Lauren. As we continue to cultivate the best talent to deliver on our strategy, we are proud that Ralph Lauren achieved certified status as a great place to work in the U.S. for the second year in a row. We were also recognized in the Top 50 on Forbes annual list of America's best employers for women. In closing we are focused on executing our strategic plan to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Each member of our engaged and motivated global team is contributing to deliver on our plan and I know I speak for Ralph and the entire leadership team when I say that we are inspired and energized by their dedication and excellent execution every day. With that I'll turn it over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you Patrice and good morning everyone. Our first quarter financial results were in line with our expectations led by ongoing strength in Europe and Asia and growth in North America despite a more volatile retail backdrop. Globally our teams delivered solid top and bottom line results including operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth and we made progress against several of our key strategic initiatives globally. First quarter revenues increased 5% in constant currency and 3% on a reported basis. Our international business which represents about 45% of our sales delivered 7% top line growth in constant currency while North America delivered growth of 3%.  Adjusted gross margin was up 10 basis points in the first quarter on a reported basis and flat in constant currency slightly better than our expectation of flat to down in the first half. Gross margins benefited from favorable product, geographic and channel mix largely offset by increased promotional activity in North America. Total company retail comps grew 2% in the quarter, AURs were up 1% with low single-digit growth in international. This was partially offset by a 1% decline in North America AUR due to increased promotional activity in our bricks and mortar channels to move through excess seasonal fashion inventory from spring. Looking ahead we still expect to drive AUR over the next three quarters consistent with our guidance of low to mid single-digit growth for fiscal 2020 and longer-term.  AUR growth this year will be driven primarily in Europe and Asia by our ongoing strategy to elevate the brand, improve pricing and promotions, and accelerate product mix shifts such as an increased penetration of fleece and outerwear. We also expect positive albeit more moderate levels of AUR growth in North America as we one, rebalance assortments across core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion products; two, mix into higher priced product categories; and three, take targeted price increases in select categories based on competitive benchmarking and where we have a proven opportunity to play. Our guidance assumes that these North America AUR drivers will be partly tempered by a continuation of increased liquidation pressure in the near-term to clear seasonal fashion product for Lauren and select men's polo fashion.  We will continue to balance an appropriate level of promotional activity with our long-term strategy of improving quality of sales and elevating the brand. Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 12.2% up 110 basis points as our teams drove SG&A leverage on top line growth. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 14% to last year. SG&A expense declined to 52.3% of sales down 100 basis points to last year driven by top line leverage and cost reduction initiatives. Marketing spend increased 19% in the first quarter. We continue to make progress towards our long-term objective of increasing marketing to about 5% of sales while also focusing on productivity to achieve our operating margin expansion goal.  Our teams remain focused on driving operating efficiencies across our business. Some key areas of savings to highlight in the first quarter are first, our supply chain end to end remains an important opportunity for productivity. We reduced our Q1 air freight expense by 50% to last year as we optimized our ocean freight programs. We also realized opportunities on the products side. We reengineered our outerwear to use innovative, recycled materials in our jackets. This enabled us to upgrade an existing product to a more premium and sustainable version for the consumer while driving savings on raw material costs.  Our work on corporate expenses also continued. Our focus on reviewing and putting nearly all our vendor contracts out to bid is generating savings without compromising quality. We continue to see a double-digit reduction in associated expenses through our renegotiated contracts. In Q1 we reduced our media partners around the world from 12 agencies to 4 and consolidated our media buys under one global lead partner to drive scale and efficiency. We also completed the sale of our corporate jet in the first quarter and donated the entirety of the proceeds to the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation as we work to drive meaningful cultural shift in our organizations cost and corporate responsibility mindset. And we will continue to simplify our organization to improve agility and empower our leaders as illustrated by some of our recent changes. Moving on to our segment performance starting with North America, revenue increased 3% in the first quarter with growth from wholesale and newly renovated stores partly offset by weaker than expected retail comps. Adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, a 100 basis point decrease to last year largely due to gross margin contraction on higher promotional activity across channels. In the retail channel in North America comps were up 1% including about a 300 basis points of benefit from the Easter shift into the first quarter. Brick and mortar comps increased 1%, softness was driven by continued traffic, challenges and a modest decline in AUR due to increased promotions this spring to clear select seasonal fashion product and keep inventories healthy. In the first quarter foreign tourist traffic was down 3%. While traffic trends were disappointing in the quarter notably in May we were encouraged by improvements we implemented towards the end of the period including an outlet. Moving forward we will continue to test and implement additional measures to mitigate traffic challenges such as improved search optimization, marketing partnerships with our mall center operators, and more targeted signage. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were flat below our expectations. We believe this was due to a combination of two factors; first, we saw diverging trends between sales to domestic versus international shoppers in the quarter. Domestic sales which comprised the majority of our digital business were up in the quarter while foreign sales were down double-digits. Similar to foreign tourists declines at our U.S. brick and mortar stores, we attribute this decline to increased headwinds from FX along with more punitive import restrictions in key Asian markets. Second, last quarter we called out a few areas where we were over assorted including select Lauren and men's polo seasonal fashion styles. We're actively addressing these issues by rebalancing our product offering as Patrice discussed. We expect declines in international shoppers to continue pressuring our North America digital comps through the rest of fiscal 2020 based on FX and tighter import restrictions with the biggest decline in Q2. However, we expect improved trends from our domestic online shoppers starting in the back half of the year. Our teams are focused on driving higher conversion among domestic consumers through one, favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and two, investing in improved mobile functionality and personalization to drive more relevant content.  Moving on to North America wholesale, first quarter revenue was up 2%. Excluding off-price our underlying North America wholesale business was also up slightly in the first quarter. We still expect Q1 will be the strongest quarter of the year as the North America retail environment has become somewhat more volatile in recent months. Moving on to Europe, first quarter revenue was up 2% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margins expanded 100 basis points on a reported basis and 10 basis points in constant currency. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins.  In the retail channel in Europe comps were up 4% driven by a 22% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick and mortar stores. Our increase in directly operating European digital commerce business was above our expectations driven by solid merchandising execution and a strong double-digit traffic increase. Our sites benefited from platform enhancements and more targeted performance marketing and further localization of our Spanish and Italian sites in the quarter. Across our Europe direct to consumer channels our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the first quarter with AUR of 2% on top of a strong 9% increase last year. Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency in the first quarter and ahead of our expectations reflecting solid sell in trends and modest distribution growth with both digital and wholesale partners similar to the last few quarters. Turning to Asia, revenue was up 4% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency in the first quarter. We saw solid performance across nearly every market in Asia led by Mainland China sales growth of nearly 30% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to increase our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet, and engage with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 5% driven by 3% AUR growth and a strong contribution from our newer doors. We expect continued comp growth in Asia as we invest in our distribution network and increased our marketing initiatives to amplify and elevate the brand. Adjusted operating margin was up 150 basis points to last year driven by strong gross margin expansion.  Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to return capital to shareholders. We ended the year with about 2 billion in cash and investments and 692 million in total debt which compares to 2.1 billion in cash and investments and 587 million in debt at the end of last year's first quarter. We repurchased a $150 million in shares in the first quarter, we will continue to opportunistically buy back stock with about 600 million in repurchase plan for full fiscal 2020.  Moving on to inventory, at the end of the first quarter inventory was up 11% to last year. The highest growth rate was in Asia to support our strategic expansion of retail distribution in that market. This was followed by Europe where we started making investments to get back into normalized inventories in our Europe factory stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We still expect to anniversary these increases as we move into the second half of this fiscal year. And lastly inventory growth in North America modestly outpaced top line growth in the first quarter which was partially driven by our decision to accelerate select portions in inventory to get ahead of potential China tariffs. We continue to expect inventories in the second half to be more closely aligned to our sales outlook. In light of the dynamic trade environment particularly China and BREXIT we will continue to opportunistically evaluate our inventory shipments to North America and the UK and diversify our global supply chain.  Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and second quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility for macroeconomic and geopolitical events. For the full year fiscal 2020 we continue to expect revenues to be up 2% to 3% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have about a 90 to 100 basis point negative impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2020. We expect continued strength in our international businesses and a more challenging outlook for North America.  We continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2020 to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency driven by a combination of modest gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about a 10 to 20 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal 2020. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we expect revenues to be up about 1% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 90 to 100 basis points in the quarter.  Operating margin for the second quarter is expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency. Margin expansion is more weighted towards the first half of the year based on the timing of our marketing and new store investments. Foreign currency is expected to be about a 20 basis point headwind in the second quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately 300 million in fiscal 2020 focused on consumer facing initiatives that have demonstrated a proof of concept and healthy rates of return including stores and digital as well as our corporate office consolidation project. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be approximately 22%. Second quarter tax rate is estimated at 23%.  In closing we are committed to delivering on our next great chapter plan while navigating a more volatile global retail backdrop. We believe we have the key elements to achieve our long-term strategic targets, a strong balance sheet, a clear strategic roadmap, Ralph's enduring creative vision, and the passion and commitment of our 24,000 team members around the world. With that let's open up the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hey guys, good morning Jane and Patrice, thanks for all the -- a lot of detail there. Jane Nielsen : Good morning Michael. Michael Binetti : Hey guys, so if I tried some of the quarter looks like North America is still a little sluggish but your international business is very, very strong. Your reiterated guidance I would like to assume has taken into account better international trends. What gives you confidence your international regions will be able to carry the top line especially if North America backdrop remains sluggish like you said and then I had a quick follow-up if I could? Patrice Louvet : Good, let me answer that one first and we will do your follow up later. Michael Binetti : Sure. Patrice Louvet : Okay, well listen good morning. We are indeed pleased with our continued momentum both in Europe and Asia. If you kind of step back and look what the key drivers were for the performance there, they really center around the work our teams have done on brand, product, and distribution, alright. So let's actually start with product. Our product is actually resonating well with the Asian and European consumers and our team has done a very good job balancing our offering between core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion across all the channels as well as and this is important as we think through AUR plans as well as mixing into higher AUR categories like outerwear or fleece. On the brand front it is actually I find really inspiring to see the work that our teams are doing to elevate the brand and connect with our target consumers whether that's an existing consumer group or the new generation that we want to bring into the family. That's probably most visible in the recent highly impactful activation that the teams have done around Wimbledon in Europe and actually in parts of Asia as well and the unique connections that we've built with the key celebrities and influencers in China for example.  And then on the distribution front our teams are elevating our presence in existing quality distribution points while expanding both online and you heard a few examples through our prepared remarks and in full price stores leveraging our new Polo boutique formats both in Europe and in Asia. And all of that is translating into what we are working to build in key cities which is this consumer centric eco system which means the consumer wherever he or she wants to shop. So those are I would say three key drivers that have supported the Asian and European performance. As we look ahead we're actually really energized by the growth opportunities for the many years to come. If you just think about two simple data points right across Europe and Asia, first is we only have 36 full price stores across all of Europe. Once you benchmark that versus where the consumer opportunity is versus where the competitive set is significant growth opportunities. Second is China only represents today despite a good progress that the group has made there over the past few months, only represents 3.5% of our total global business. Again when you benchmark that with a number of our peers you get a good indication of the upside opportunities there. So were encouraged and excited about what's ahead in both Europe and Asia.  What's also really important is many of the success drivers that we're seeing in Europe and Asia actually were very relevant for us in the U.S. as we continue to work on stabilizing and pivoting this important market back to growth. And I think you've seen that we've made a number of organizational changes over the past few months that will enable us to rapidly leverage these learnings in North America. Michael Binetti : Sure, thanks for the detail. If I could just ask Jane back to your comments on AUR details that you gave, still positive globally but negative one in North America. You said you cleared some product, can you talk about the guidance, you signaled slight -- it seems like you're signaling a slight reacceleration of low to mid single-digits for the remainder of the year. In particular you mentioned some targeted price increases in North America. We haven't heard that from you in a while. Can you talk about where you see opportunity and maybe help us reconcile that with some of the ongoing expectations to stay competitive on the promotional backdrop in the North America industry? Jane Nielsen : Sure, well as we look at pricing Michael we really see opportunities that we've called out in the past. So we continue to work on sharper promotion, we are continuing to move into better product and category mix, and a better balance of our merchandising assortment which is going to be favorable to pricing as we move forward. And then as you noted we called out that we have done competitive benchmarking and looked at select opportunities to take to get pricing in targeted and select areas. It is a part of our overall pricing approach and will really start to play out for us in the second half. But we've incorporated that into our guidance, we expect that our AUR journey will improve as we move into the second half while being cognizant that in North America with our efforts especially in the second quarter to move through some of our spring products, there will be a little more pressure on that AUR growth although we do expect overall AUR growth to improve more moderately in North America. Michael Binetti : Okay, very, very helpful. Thanks again for all the details. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Matthew Boss : Thanks, a nice quarter in a tough backdrop. Jane Nielsen : Thanks Matt. Matthew Boss : Maybe Patrice on the North American Apparel landscape both at wholesale and your own retail, I guess what exactly have you seen change versus maybe three or six months ago and I guess in light of that any changes specifically in your strategy necessarily to navigate the underlying reaching at cross currents [ph]?. Patrice Louvet : Sure, so listen as we look at the overall picture actually the U.S. consumer remains relatively healthy, right, in our space. But we have taken a slightly more cautious view of the retail environment for the year ahead. We continue to clearly see challenges with brick and mortar traffic like both full price and outlets including foreign tourist volatility. And our focus now is really to make sure we offset this through higher conversion and accelerated efforts in marketing across channels in North America. Probably three things I would call out here, the first one is taking steps to mitigate the brick and mortar traffic and the promotional headwinds, right.  So if you look at the factory channel in particular we have a number of interventions underway. One is making sure we've got the right product mix and improving our offering across all the price points including elevated products as well as having the right entry price points. Two is working on our store marketing and particularly the window signage which is very important for this business. And then also working on marketing outside of the center to bring people into the center. So we're partnering with the landlords and leveraging all their platform probably more than we've ever done to really activate traffic and bring traffic into the center.  And then we were also raising the bar in terms of quality and targeting of our e-mail marketing. We have a very strong database that we can leverage and we're getting a lot more precise in terms of the messaging for the specific target group. So the combination of those factors we believe will lead to an improvement. And then you heard Jane talk about targeted price increases as well, right, where we believe we have largely driven by what we think the consumer reaction will be but where we believe we have pricing opportunities versus competition driven by I think the brand elevation work that we've done over the past few years. And the resulting increased value to the consumer. So let's say that's first intervention. Second intervention as we look to really control our destiny with DTC it is actually focusing on digital improvement. We were really pleased with the traffic performance in North America RalphLauren.com this quarter up a very healthy 20%. Alright, so we want to fuel that but we also want make sure we're also translating that into strong conversion. So a number of interventions underway here, investments in mobile, about two thirds of all of our transactions are in mobile so it's very clear that that's how the consumer wants to interact and we're investing in strengthening our mobile capabilities whether that's how the visuals show up, how quickly the downloads happen, and so on and so forth. But you'll see significant progress on this front. Investment and personalization which we know is highly effective and that's actually coming in on stream over the next few days and weeks. Working on our omnichannel capabilities, we are really connecting the website to our stores so recently we just launched find in-store which allows you to identify in your local store through the website what products are available, you can book appointments on our website for your local store, and so on and so forth. And then finally realigning as we talked in our prepared remarks our buys to be better balanced across core, seasonal core, and seasonal fashion. And then the other parts of controlling our destiny with DTC is the marketing activities that you've seen us do and you'll see us continue to do and accelerate in parallel with the increased investments and that's building exciting brand experiences with events like the upcoming U.S. Open, like limited editions we just dropped Polo Sport this past quarter which did very well both in denim and the silver edition. And then continuing to strengthen our connections and our activations of influencers and celebrities.  Then finally we are investing in kind of the store experience and also exploring new channels particularly in the digital front alright so new channels like [indiscernible] Rent the Runway we now have three of our brands on Rent the Runway; Lauren, Club Monocle, and more recently Polo Women's was launched on Rent the Runway and we're seeing very positive response, we're excited about progress we're making there. And obviously the whole social commerce platforms that are expanding across the country.  And then finally and this is a new thought, we've talked since we started the next chapter plan is really elevating our brick and mortar experience, investing in the overall store layout, in the lighting, in the fixtures, and in the overall experience we provide consumers both in wholesale, in factory, and in our full price stores. So the combination of these factors and this slightly more volatile environments give us confidence that we can continue to make progress in North America to stabilize the business and its growth. Matthew Boss : Great, and then maybe just a follow up Jane, help us to think about the components of the North American comp maybe between e-commerce and brick and mortar, if we were thinking about the second quarter versus the back half of the year? Jane Nielsen : Yeah I think on North America comp I think we're seeing that there will be some pressure on the digital compass we move through the year from these international flows that we called out in this quarter. But in the second half we believe that on digital some of the investments that we're making in personalization and driving better mobile conversion will start -- you'll start to see those pay out in the back half. And then in terms of the overall bricks and mortar comp you will see some improvement as we move through the year, again part of that is AUR led and so it'll be back more weighted in the second half as we move into the layers of pricing that we talked about. Matthew Boss : Great, best of luck. Jane Nielsen : And that's all Easter adjusted Matt. Matthew Boss : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is open. John Kernan : Hi, good morning Patrice and James. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to international, obviously a point of strength. And maybe go back to some of the targets you laid out at the Investor Day about a year ago. Can you talk about the $500 million in revenue you expect in China, it feels like there's obviously a lot of momentum there right now, maybe you can talk about both the digital and physical direct expansion that's going on there right now and then maybe have a follow up on Europe? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure, you will attack this one Jane. So yes our goal is to indeed get Greater China to $0.5 million in revenue. We're making good progress. Again this quarter Mainland China up 30%, Greater China up 12%, continuing to see a strong progress across both digital and brick and mortar. To your point on those different platforms, I mean our thinking is really six big cities [indiscernible] Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei, and Hong Kong. And we build omnichannel eco systems across all of these with both brick and mortar presence, some more iconic elevated presence, and some kind of hard working from the revenue productivity stand point with our new Polo Boutiques coupled with our work with pure players and we've got a really nice partnerships and momentum with JD, with Timor [ph] and with WeChat and then also some strong partnerships from the concession stand point. And we're continuing to drive where we are and expand.  So we expect from a brick and mortar standpoint to open about 40 stores this fiscal year so about one a week if you remove the holidays. And on our way to achieving what we talked about last year on Investor Day which is around 150 stores across Greater China and then we continue to invest in expanding our digital presence through existing platforms and new platform and take advantage of all the key events that are happening there. So, we participated in 618 recently and actually had strong performance across the board with our various partners on that whether that was team JD or others. And we're doing specific programs with WeChat. And just so in general we feel good about where we are relative to the guide path that we had laid out for ourselves on our way to $0.5 billion and we sometimes get the question are you seeing any changes with the consumer in China right now and the answer so far is no. But the brand continues to resonate well with consumers and we're actually pleased with the mix of consumers we're getting both from a gender standpoint men and women, pretty balanced and also from an age standpoint, we're bringing in a lot of young consumers into the franchise. Jane Nielsen : Hey John I would just add that we were very pleased with our digital commerce this quarter in China and across Asia. It was up 26% so a real comp accelerator. We expect that dynamic to continue. We were also pleased with what we saw overall in terms of the comp acceleration that was coming from our newer Polo Boutique stores that Patrice called out notably in China which has been the focus of our new doors. So that is durable and we're encouraged by that continued momentum. John Kernan : Just a quick follow up on Europe, your strength there both in wholesale, retail, and within digital as well. So just wondering how we should think about Europe as your frame of guidance for the rest of the year, I know there's some moving pieces in macro environment so just how should we think about the quarterly flow of Europe as we go into the rest of the year? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yeah, John what we've seen in Europe and let me just give you the component pieces, we still see the underlying trends for your wholesale as about mid single-digit. There are obviously some shipment timing that goes on in Europe but we've been talking about that as the underlying trend and we see that as sort of the ongoing underlying trend for Europe wholesale. On the bricks and mortar side you've seen us have a pretty steady positive comp. We'd expect that to continue especially as we are overlapping the investments that we made in our factory outlet channel. That overlap will start to -- the benefit of that overlap with the investments that we made in inventory will start to tail off in the second half as we anniversary that but we're still encouraged by our bricks and mortar comp in Europe. And then as we anniversary the replatform of our digital site in Europe the first half will be stronger than the second half as we anniversaried that overlap but positive trends in Europe in e-commerce. John Kernan : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Kate Fitzsimons : Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Jane my question is more on the cost saving efforts that you have done year-to-date. As you think about fiscal 2020 where do you see buckets of opportunities on the expense side as the year progresses, you spoke to some supply chain -- media buy here in Q1, any other movers [ph] you can share with us as the year progresses just in light of this more volatile environment that you're seeing? And then secondly, any update on the distribution center consolidation product or the headquarter relocation project, any update there would be helpful? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure, so Kate as we look to FY20 we do expect that the DC consolidation is going to be durable throughout this year in terms of the benefit that we got from consolidating those in addition to the activities that allowed which was inventory consolidation. So that will continue and are procurement work on indirect expenses is also durable through the year. So we take on obviously the largest vendor contracts first but we are systematically moving through nearly all of our indirect vendor renegotiations and those are paced through the year as those contracts expire and are renewed. So you can expect to see that continue through the year. And supply chain efficiencies that we are working with our wholesale partners on should also be positive as we move through the years. So not only just repacking our product, using cross stock activities but also some of the work that we called out on product suppliers where we can make products more sustainable and more cost advantaged is ongoing work.  In terms of and also just organizational agility, based on some of the work that we've called out recently that we've done to simplify our organization you'll see some of that come through the payroll benefits as we move through the year notably in divisional cost structures and headquarter cost structures. Our work in terms of our headquarter consolidation is going well. You will not see that impact come through the financials until FY21. This is the year as we move that we do have some double rent expenses but you will see that be a durable benefit as we move through and we're very pleased with the supply chain consolidation. I'd say it's right on track with our expectations. Patrice Louvet : If I could just add, we were also reworking the different capabilities we have externally. So, indeed you have seen the work on media going from 12 agencies to 4, doing that across all social and digital as well. We are getting nothing but better and cheaper so better capabilities and lower cost. Jane Nielsen : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. Your line is open. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On the last call it was noted that half of the operating margin leverage expected for us by 2020 will come from the gross margin. Jane is that still the case and how should we think about the GM progression by quarter of the year? And then on marketing spend up 19%, how should we think about the second quarter and the full year? Jane Nielsen : Yes, so let me take your gross margin progression. We still -- as we've maintained our guidance and we still expect about half to come from gross margin expansion for the full year and about half to come from SG&A leverage again for the full year. As we look at the second quarter Laurent I see more, about two thirds of the operating margin expansion will come from gross margin expansion and about a third from SG&A leverage. So that's how you can think about the quarter.  In terms of marketing expenses as we move through the year we had a strong first quarter and I would expect that second quarter will be slightly less robust in terms of marketing expansion as we anniversary a lot of our 50th anniversary activities. You'll see some leverage from marketing in the second quarter but then you'll see marketing growth in the third and fourth quarter. Patrice Louvet : We expect marketing all to increase ahead of sales again this fiscal year as we work our way towards marketing investments representing about 5% of total revenue. Laurent Vasilescu : Very helpful, thank you. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, last question please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Dana Telsey : Hi, good morning everyone. As you think about the digital business and the progress that you're making there, how do you dissect it by region and also the AUR progress on digital promotions versus full price by region? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : So in terms of digital progress as we talked we're very pleased with what we're seeing in Asia and the benefit that we've had from our replatforming in Europe and the growth of those markets. We are investing in North America. I think Patrice call highlighted some of the pressures from international and we expect those benefits to start to play out in the second half and we're encouraged by that. In terms of our AUR are progression on digital, a) our digital AURs will really follow what we're putting in place across all of DTC and so the second half as we take some targeted pricing will be more robust than the first half. And the first half is weighted by clearing out of some of our spring product. But you'll see those promotion and list prices go into effect more in the second half. Dana Telsey : Got it and then just lastly as you think about inventory levels, how do you see them progressing through the year, should we continue to see this rate of increase given the uncertainty with tariffs? Jane Nielsen : Starting in the second half you will see inventory that's closer aligned with our sales. We are trying to be quite flexible Dana as we manage BREXIT implications as well as China duty implications. And so we're going to be opportunistic as we were in this quarter and we accelerated some inventory into North America. So we're going to -- we're going to remain flexible on that but I think that as we move forward you will see inventory more closely aligned to sales. Dana Telsey : Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Alright, very good. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining this morning and we look forward to our next call early November. Have a great day. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you Corey. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We delivered second quarter results slightly ahead of our overall expectations including better than expected revenue, expanded operating margin and double-digit EPS growth. Our performance this quarter was driven by ongoing momentum in our international markets both Europe and Asia and balanced gross margin expansion and expense management. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in brand elevation and execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against a more volatile backdrop. As we indicated at the start of this fiscal year, we are monitoring the global retail environment closely, particularly around trade and macro conditions. Our teams remain intensely focused on managing through volatile industry dynamics and executing on our strategic plan to deliver long term sustainable growth and value creation. As I have shared before, the three principles underlying this work include putting the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevating the brand and balancing growth and productivity. During the second quarter, we continued to drive our performance across the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five-year plan. These include first, win over new generation of consumers, second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories, third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels, fourth, lead with digital across all activities and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We continue to invest in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely digital and social and are on track toward our long term marketing investment target of 5% of sales. In the second quarter, marketing declined 10% to last year due to timing of investments as we anniversaried our landmark 50th anniversary celebrations last fall. Our key marketing initiatives this quarter centered around our September fashion show experience, Wimbledon and U.S. Open Tennis partnerships as well as the Ralph Lauren and Friends collaboration. This September, we presented an exciting Fall 2019 collection through a one-of-a-kind immersive experience of fashion, hospitality and live entertainment we called Ralph's Club. Our jazz age inspired nightclub seamlessly integrated guests into the show itself as the multitalented Janelle Monae inspired us with a performance for the ages. Influencers and celebrities from around the world from Taylor Hill to Cate Blanchett, Mandy Moore to A$AP Ferg, Henry Golding, JJ Lin and Luodan Wang joined in the evening. It was our most viewed live stream to-date. As we continue to leverage our global digital reach, we have more than 10 billion total media impressions around the event. In Asia alone, we generated over 32 million live and video views of the show. Moving on to our sports engagements. We closed out our summer sports program with our official sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships here in New York. The U.S. Open, combined with our high visibility Wimbledon partnership earlier in the summer, drove over 17 billion media impressions globally. Building on the April release of our Earth Polo shirt made entirely from recycled plastic bottles, the official ballpeople were outfitted in uniforms using the same innovation. The tennis ball cans collected from the tournament this year will be used to produce mix-use uniforms. This is a great example of our Design the Change sustainability strategy coming to life across our products. To further amplify our sponsorship, we partnered with TikTok, the social media platform beloved by GenZ becoming the first luxury brand to drive a digital commerce campaign on the platform. Our campaign leveraged influencers and custom content to drive more than 0.5 million views and significant click-through to ralphlauren.com. And lastly, we finished up quarter with our Ralph Lauren and Friends 25th Anniversary capsule collection in September, a playful ode to lead character Jennifer Aniston's fictional work experience at Ralph Lauren. Featured exclusively at Bloomingdale's and on ralphlauren.com, the campaign generated over one billion media impressions alone. Finally, as you may have seen, we recently celebrated the upcoming HBO release of Very Ralph directed by the award-winning Susan Lacy. The documentary follows Ralph's journey from his childhood in the Bronx to building an iconic lifestyle business and becoming an emblem of American style around the world. I hope you will all watch it live on HBO on November 12. Moving on to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. In the second quarter, Ralph and our design team continued to drive excitement in core product categories while also leveraging the halo of limited edition releases and expanding into high potential underdeveloped categories. Top-selling categories for Fall 2019 to-date have included lightweight down jackets, windbreakers, fleece and casual woven shirts, including Oxford shirts. We continue to work to consistently get the balance of core, seasonal core and fashion right across each brand and distinct channels. This quarter, we released a limited-edition draw, Indigo Stadium, in September inspired by our original 1992 Polo Stadium collection. Pieces included signature silhouettes such as our popover jacket, windbreaker, tearaway track pants and fleece updated with indigo dye treatments. The release was available exclusively on our Polo app, influential specialty accounts like Opening Ceremony, Fred Segal, HBX and Bodega as well as select Ralph Lauren stores and retailers internationally. Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive youth oriented capsule collaboration with ASOS available globally online and the special collections celebrating our 35th Anniversary of Polo Ralph Lauren in Korea. We continued to make solid progress this quarter on our five underdeveloped categories as well. These include denim, outerwear, Wear To Work, footwear and accessories. Denim sell-out outperformed our total topline trends in the second quarter. And as we approach the upcoming winter season, outerwear sell-in are strongly outpacing our overall sales trends. Meanwhile, our Ralph Lauren and Friends collection leverage our expanding Wear To Work initiative with modern pieces for both men and women rooted in the Ralph Lauren aesthetic. In fragrance, we launched the latest iterations of Romance for women and Polo Red for men. Focused on reaching a new generation of consumers, the campaign featured our Ralph Lauren ambassadors, Taylor Hill for Beyond Romance and Ansel Elgort, Polo Red Remix. Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. Our long term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive brand elevating Ralph Lauren experience across our retail, wholesale and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. During the second quarter, we opened 20 new stores and concessions globally and closed 21 locations. This included 15 openings in Asia. We also completed door refreshes in key markets around the world, including our Place de la Madeleine flagship store in Paris and factory door renovation in North America and China, where we continue to elevate our fleet across every touch point. Our consumer centric ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter with China Mainland sales up more than 20% in constant currency, driven by comp growth and new stores. Total China sales were up modestly to last year in constant currency including Hong Kong headwinds, which Jane will discuss in her remarks. In Europe, we opened four owned and partnered full price stores. While we are making good progress, we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 40 full price stores across Europe with all of this complemented by our successful digital commerce expansion. Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce increased low teens in the second quarter in constant currency. The strong performance was driven by more than 30% growth in international. While this was tempered by more modest growth in North America, our North America digital sales were positive and ahead of expectations improving sequentially from first quarter trends. Starting with Europe. Digital sales were up double digits in the quarter with strong performance across each channel. We added 17 new wholesale digital partners including La Redoute, one of the largest digital pure players in France. Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw continued momentum delivering 13% comp growth this quarter. Recent enhancements included optimizations to our mobile site and checkout process and a new digital commerce flagship for Ireland as we continue to drive our localization efforts by market. We also recently launched Instagram in Europe. In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also solid led by China. We added five exciting new digital partners in the second quarter, including Secoo, a luxury e-commerce platform in China, GS Shop, the number one multimedia retailer in Korea and Marui, a leading omnichannel retailer targeting younger consumers in Japan. We also continue to elevate our presence with key digital pure players like Tmall during the quarter. Turning to North America. Second quarter comps on ralphlauren.com were up 2% and better-than-expected. Similar to the first quarter, we continued to experience declines from international consumers on our U.S. site due to FX headwinds and increased import regulations in key Asian markets. However, sales to domestic shoppers were up single digits and slightly better than first quarter trends as we started to improve our mobile user experience and drive more targeted email marketing. Under our new global merchandising effort, we are also rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products going forward. Our digital performance should start to reflect these initiatives, along with further improvements in mobile and personalization to drive conversion more in the back half of fiscal 2020. Lastly, we continued to build partnerships with new digital platforms in North America, which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the second quarter, we launched men's polo sportswear on revolve.com and its sister site, FWRD. We also launched Lauren ready-to-wear and dresses on Nuuly, the new subscription service from Urban Outfitters, targeting our next-generation consumer. Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to fuel growth. In the second quarter, we continued to challenge every cost and improve our efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points exceeded our expectations, driven by gross margin expansion, disciplined expense management and lower marketing spend in the quarter. This cost discipline enabled continued expansion of our global retail presence while increasing operating profit and operating margin. Looking at our supply chain. Year to date, we have continued to increase its flexibility and efficiency. With the enactment of this List 4 tariffs from China in the quarter, we have continued our multipronged effort to mitigate the cost impact. This includes, first, working with our existing partners within China to drive increased productivity. Second, further diversifying our supply chain outside of China. Over the past two years, we have reduced our U.S. exposure to China from over 40% to about 22% by the end of this fiscal year and moving to approximately mid-teens for fiscal 2021. And third, while we are focused on driving the first two strategies to mitigate as much of the tariff headwind as possible and minimize the direct impact to the consumer, we are also planning targeted global price increases. As previously discussed, the central part of our next great chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North American outlet channel in late September. Our North America full price wholesale and direct to consumer doors will reflect targeted price increases, starting with our Spring 2020 assortments. Leveraging the success we have had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and are focused on the value proposition for our consumers. Jane will provide further detail on AUR and the expected financial impact of tariffs in her prepared remarks. In closing, in the context of a more volatile environment, we continue to deliver solid progress on our next great chapter plan. Ralph and I are proud of our teams' execution this quarter as they delivered across each of our strategic pillars with passion and excellence. Together, we remain focused on driving each of these areas to deliver long term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Jane and I will join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you Patrice and good morning everyone. Our teams delivered solid top and bottomline results in the second quarter with expansion in both gross and operating margin driving operating profit growth and double digit EPS growth. Globally, we also continue to make progress against our key strategic initiatives in the quarter with encouraging early signs of progress in our direct to consumer business in North America, our largest market. These included positive brick-and-mortar and digital comps in North America as well as Europe and Asia, sequential AURs improvement on top of difficult compares and inventory more closely aligned to our topline growth. Second quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Our international business, which represents about 45% of our sales, delivered 7% topline growth in constant currency while North America was down 1%. Total company retail comps grew 2% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the second quarter on a reported basis and up 80 basis points in constant currency. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 2% with favorable channel and geographic mix, coupled with pricing, promotion management and product assortment. All three regions delivered positive AUR growth. Looking ahead, we expect second half AUR to be incrementally stronger than the first half of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single digit AUR growth for fiscal 2020. This will be driven by, one, targeted price increases in select channels and categories based on competitive benchmarking and where we have a proven opportunity to play, two, accelerated product mix shifts such as an increased penetration of fleece and outerwear for fall holiday which are already resonating well with consumers and three, our ongoing strategy of pulling back promotions to improve quality of sales and elevate the brand globally across each of our distribution channels. While we are closely watching the broader competitive environment and in-season trends, we are pleased with our inventory position and remain focused on managing our inventory with discipline in order to mitigate promotional risk. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 14.9%, up 100 basis points on a reported basis and up 130 basis points in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 8% to last year. SG&A expense declined to 46.6% of sales, down 30 basis points to last year, driven by cost reduction initiatives and lower marketing expense. Marketing decreased 10% in the quarter as we anniversaried last year's higher investments around our 50th Anniversary show and related events. However, we continue to expect marketing spend to grow ahead of our sales for full year fiscal 2020. Our teams remain focused on generating operating efficiencies across our business. Some key highlights from our second quarter include, first, we realized continued efficiencies across our supply chain including incremental productivity with our existing strategic sourcing partners, reduced freight cost contracts and lower air freight cost, all contributing to mitigating the cost of List 4 tariffs. On the product side, we reduced product cost in outerwear while also improving our on-time delivery rate by over 30% in order to drive sales and margin in this high potential underpenetrated category. At the same time, we also improved our overall value proposition by significantly increasing the use of sustainable materials in our outerwear production. Our continued work on corporate expenses delivered a 10% reduction in corporate overhead. This includes our ongoing vendor renegotiations process where we are addressing over 100 global indirect spend contracts this year, driving savings of about 15% from our previous contracts and we continue to digitize the way we work to drive both productivity and a better consumer experience. We recently completed the successful transition of our order management system for ralphlauren.com in North America, which will enable the implementation of new omnichannel functionality and improved mobile experience, personalization and more, all at a significant saving to our previous provider. Moving on to our segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 1% in the second quarter, as growth in our retail business was more than offset by our wholesale revenue declines. Adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, a 100 basis point decrease to last year with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by gross margin contraction and SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales. In the retail channel in North America, comps were up 2% as both brick-and-mortar comps and sales on our own digital commerce site, each grew 2%. Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by a 2% increase in AUR. In the second quarter, we tested targeted email offers, improved outlet window signage and leveraged page search optimization to mitigate traffic challenges. At factory, AUR and comp conversion both improved in the quarter and we continue to focus on driving better traffic trends through increased marketing, refreshed store experiences and product improvement, including expansion in underdeveloped categories like outerwear. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were up 2% above our expectations. Positive growth from domestic consumers was partially offset by lower sales to international shoppers on our U.S. site, as Patrice discussed. We expect to reduce sales to international shoppers to continue to pressure our North America digital comps through the rest of fiscal 2020. Through the second half, digital sales to our domestic online shoppers are expected to improve. Our teams are focused on driving higher conversion among domestic consumers through, one, favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear or fleece and two, investing in improved mobile functionality, site architecture and personalization to drive more relevant content. Moving on to North America wholesale. Second quarter revenue declined 6%. Excluding off-price, our underlying North America wholesale business was down high single digits in the second quarter, as expected. While our market share increased slightly in our men's polo business, we continue to see modest share declines in women's as Lauren underperformed the market. We continue to work on improving our product mix while also driving a return to core categories in Lauren's women's. Additionally, we continue to improve the consumer experience in the wholesale channel through in-store refreshes, expansion into underpenetrated categories and increased marketing. With North America now mobilized under new leadership at both wholesale and regional level, it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these improvements. Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margins expanded 170 basis points on a reported basis and 220 basis points in constant currency. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. In the retail channel in Europe, comps were up 3%, driven by a 13% increase in our own digital commerce sites and a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores. The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectation, driven by solid merchandising execution and traffic increases. Our sites continue to benefit from platform enhancements, more targeted performance marketing and further localization of regional sites. Across our Europe direct to consumer channels, our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the second quarter, with AUR up 6% on top of a strong 8% increase last year. Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 7% in constant currency in the second quarter and also ahead of our expectations. The strong performance reflected solid sell-out trends driving stronger reorders particularly with our digital pure play partners, modest distribution growth with both digital and wholesale partners similar to the last few quarters and a shift in timing of shipments to a key digital pure play account from the back half of fiscal 2020 into Q2. Turning to Asia. Revenue was up 4% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency in the second quarter. We saw solid performance across nearly every market in Asia including China Mainland sales growth of over 20% in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region and we continue to increase our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet and engage with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia increased 1% with positive AUR growth and a strong contribution from our newer doors. In Hong Kong, where we have several important retail doors, heavy protest disruption drove the equivalent of 48 full days of store closures during the quarter. These closures, along with significantly lower tourism, drove declines in our Hong Kong business and negatively impacted our total Asia comp by about three points. While we expect Hong Kong to remain a near term headwind, we are encouraged by continued momentum in the rest of Asia and we still expect positive fiscal 2020 comp growth for this segment as we invest in our distribution network and drive marketing to amplify and elevate the brand. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to last year driven by strong gross margin expansion. Moving onto the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to return capital to shareholders. We ended the year with about $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $693 million in total debt which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $684 million in debt at the end of last year's second quarter. We accelerated our share repurchases to $250 million in shares in the second quarter. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for fiscal 2020. Moving on to inventory. At the end of the second quarter, inventory was up 2% to last year, improving significantly from up 11% at the end of the first quarter. Inventory growth was driven by Asia to support our strategic expansion of retail distribution in that market. North America inventory growth was moderately above sales trends, but improved sequentially. And Europe inventories were down significantly as we started to anniversary last year's investments in our factory stores. We continue to expect second half inventories to remain relatively aligned with our sales outlook. Now I would like to turn to guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. For the full year fiscal 2020, we are maintaining guidance of 2% to 3% revenue growth in constant currency introduced at the beginning of this year, but now expect results closer to the low end of this range. Foreign currency is now expected to have about 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. We are maintaining our operating margin guidance for fiscal 2020 of 40 to 60 basis points expansion in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 20 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal 2020. While these topline expectations are still within our original guidance, our outlook now incorporates intensifying headwinds and some continued temporary door closures in Hong Kong, pressuring both Asia comp and retail expense leverage. Nevertheless, we are maintaining our full year operating margin guidance despite the headwinds from Hong Kong along with increased tariff related startup costs as we buildout new regional sourcing operations and our initiatives to prepare for a potential Brexit. Based on the tariffs enacted to date, our guidance includes about $10 million in negative impact to our fiscal 2020 cost of goods. Meanwhile, we have maintained our commitment to accelerate marketing investments to position the company for sustainable long term growth. We now expect other income of approximately $10 million for the year, down to the prior year, as a result of lower interest rates and accelerated share repurchases, reducing our interest income. For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be flat in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by 70 to 90 basis points in the quarter. We expect disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact revenue by about $10 million in the quarter. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be flat to down 20 basis points in constant currency. This is primarily due to the timing of SG&A investments with our highest dollar marketing in the third quarter this year and temporary duplicate rent as we consolidate our New York headquarters, more than offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter. Foreign currency is expected to have a minimal impact on the operating margin in the third quarter. Third quarter tax rate is estimated at 21%. In closing, we continue to be vigilant regarding the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and we are committed to maintaining discipline on costs and inventory as we elevate the brand and return the company to sustainable growth and value creation. We are proud of the work our teams around the world are doing to execute on our next great chapter plan. Guided by Ralph's creative vision, our teams are executing with agility and a passion for the brand. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Paul Trussell : Good morning and congrats on quite solid results. Patrice Louvet : Good morning Paul. Jane Nielsen : Thank you Paul. Paul Trussell : There are a number of notable headwinds in the marketplace, some of which have led your peers to reduce their go-forward expectations. In your view, what drove your performance in Q2? And what are you seeing in the business that enables you to maintain your earnings guidance for the full year? And on North America specifically, could you speak to your surprising positive comps and the outlook for the region? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Hi. Good morning Paul. Thanks for your question. The first thing I really want to say is, I am really proud of the way our teams executed this quarter because, as you mentioned, we were able to exceeded expectations while dealing with a wide range of challenges from tariffs, the Hong Kong situation, the Brexit uncertainty and the further acceleration of our supply chain moves. This coupled with the organizational changes that we talked about over the past few months really gives us confidence that we should just continue to running the play through our next great chapter plan, obviously with a higher degree of agility that's required in today's context. On the specific drivers of this quarter's performance that we believe are sustainable, there is probably four I would call out. The first one is the fact that we are seeing brand momentum both with new consumers and with current consumers and we have had, I think as you have heard during our prepared remarks, a number of high impact marketing activities during the quarter. One I would highlight is the application we did on Wimbledon globally through celebrities and influencers around the world. Second driver is product, right. I think we have seen this quarter is the beginning of a better balance between core, seasonal core and fashion product, coupled with exciting growth in outerwear as we go into the holiday season. Third area is distribution. And one of our big priorities is to continue to elevate the brand presence, the shopping experience for consumers wherever they shop, be that in brick-and-mortar or in digital. And we are also continuing to expand both in Europe and Asia and have significant growth opportunities moving forward in those two regions. And the final point is, while we are investing behind all these initiatives, we are continuing to drive operating efficiencies and cost discipline. Now specifically to your question on North America. We were very pleased with the comp performance this quarter of 2%. The key thing I would highlight here is the during progress we made in our full price stores were the result of marketing and really bringing consumers into the store, the result of engagements with our VIPs and the change we made in our compensation structure to really drive a total team push in our respective stores has really played out very nicely. We are also encouraged by the progress we are making on our website, particularly with domestic consumers and also continued to see good progress in our factory outlets. Jane Nielsen : Yes. I would say, Paul, that we were really pleased with Q2 and our ability to maintain our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we look at some of the headwinds that we named, from Hong Kong to tariffs to Brexit, it's about $0.25 to $0.30 to EPS. And what we have really been able to do is to have our teams react in a very agile fashion and what we are seeing is that continued momentum on AUR, plus our brick-and-mortar conversion improvements that we are seeing in our stores, notably in North America and continued strong performance across Europe and Asia are what's enabling us to hold our overall operating margin guidance and our revenue guidance through the year. So really proud of the teams. And we see those drivers as durable throughout the rest of this year. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for our questions. I add my congrats on a good quarter, specially the North American comp. I know it's the best number you have seen in a while. Patrice Louvet : Thanks Michael. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Michael Binetti : Any initial response to those U.S. price increases would be helpful. But I did want to talk about the outlook for second half for a minute, Jane. The guidance you give us implies the operating profit growth rate to slow and even potentially turn negative on a year-over-year basis at the end of the year. The 20118 Analyst Day guidance assumes operating profit growth each year. Can you give us some high level thoughts on how to think about the lower, even negative, growth rate at the end of this year? And how you see that starting to improve into next year, in particular North America where your operating margins have been negative on year-over-year basis? I think it's really a sentiment of the ongoing declines in wholesale and you guys make very good money in that channel. So those losses are profitable. Can you speak to how you look at North America margins in the second half? Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Sure. In terms of the first part of your questions, which is U.S. price increases, we are still in early days. As you will recall, Michael, we set first tranche of prices in late September, early October. While it's too soon to call, we are encouraged by what we saw through back to school and through the early days of the work that. So that is sort of guiding our own guidance for AUR growth in the low single digit range for the full year and an increase in AUR as we move through the back half. While we anticipate some headwinds in third quarter from an OI margin perspective, we still are guiding and maintaining our guidance for OI expansion for the fiscal year, which puts us in line for continued operating margin expansion through the course of our next great chapter plan. As we laid out the guidance, we knew that some things would respond better than others. With their puts and takes we are certainly encouraged right now by our gross margin progress that we are making. And then other things would take longer to turn like North America wholesale. We are just really focused on our pressure areas, the Lauren brand, the Polo brand is performing in wholesale. Were back to investing in marketing with our wholesale partners and are really focused on sell-out in that channel. That will be the ultimate metric pf performance in that channel. And so we still feel good as we look to our five-year guidance with that mid-teens operating margin target that we laid out over a year-and-a-half ago. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Matthew Boss : Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Patrice Louvet : Thanks Matt. Jane Nielsen : Thanks Matt. Matthew Boss : So on the gross margin, maybe Jane, what was the break down of the 80 basis points constant currency expansion in the second quarter? How best to think about puts and takes for the back half of the year? And then as we think multiyear, I guess maybe Jane again, how would you rank the buckets of continued gross margin expansion opportunity versus any headwinds to consider as we are thinking beyond this year? Jane Nielsen : Sure. So let me lay out what happened in this quarter first because I think it provides good context to the back half of the year. As I look at pricing, promotion management and assorting in to higher AUR and gross margin overall product, that is a little over half of the benefit that we saw from gross margin expansion. We also got some benefits from channel and geographic mix. As you know, we expect those to be durable through the course of the plan with greater and lesser puts and takes. And obviously, we called out the pressure points from FX and some ongoing tariff benefits, which is small today based on the tariffs that were enacted in Q2, but we expect to be the biggest point of increasing pressure as we move through the back half of the year. Now counterbalancing that as we move into the back half, we expect that some of our pricing actions will start to kick in. And we go in with tighter inventory positions and edited but improving assortments that should improve our excess positions as we move through the back half of the year. So an encouraging start, a little ahead of where we thought we would be but a driver through the remainder of FY 2020. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Ike Boruchow : Hi. Good morning everyone. Let me add my congrats. Two quick ones for Jane, I think. Could you just help us understand what's embedded in the North America wholesale plan for the back half and if there is any variability between Q3 and Q4? And then any color around off-price versus the traditional U.S. wholesale within that? And then just really quickly, you had commented I think that the Q2 digital comp had some benefit from timing from a very big partner. Should we be expecting the digital European comp to be much less robust in the back half or any specific quarter? Just trying to understand what's going on there. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure. A multi-part question. All right. Let me start with the first part which is what's embedded in our back half outlook for North America wholesale. We don't guide regions and certainly not channels but I can tell you, Ike, that what we see today with our sell-out trends down mid to high single digits, we are expecting that to continue through the back half of this year. We are focused on our sell-out trends. We believe that we will be making some edits into the spring that will be better. But until we have better sell-out trends, that's our expectations for the revenue that we will report which is sell-in and so that's our expectation and that's embedded in the back half of the year. Always working to improve and we think that you will start to see that as we maintain a new leadership set but that will be closer to the start of our next fiscal. If you think about the color on overall North America off-price, this quarter off-price, especially in North America, was essentially about flattish. We had a pullback in some of our cut it business that we, in order to keep our inventories clean, had some flow of overall excess. I expect that that trend, as we use it as an excess channel, it will be a little choppy as we move through the back half of the year. And then on Q2 and back half European digital trends, we did in preparation for holiday accelerate a little bit of shipments into Q2 to one of our larger customers and that we expect that for fiscal 2020 digital comps will be at a more normalized level following last year's replatforming in the second half. But the total ecosystem will be a low double digit comp for the year. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Kate Fitzsimons : Yes. Hi. Good morning, I will add my congratulations. I wanted to dig a bit more into the North American digital comp plus 2%. Can you just speak to what drove that sequential gain? It sounds like you saw some resonance with some mobile investments domestically. So just wanted to hear more about what changes were made in the quarter and what gives you confidence that business can continue to improve go forward? And I guess when you benchmark your digital and mobile experience relative to peers, where do you really see as the opportunity go forward on as we look to 2020? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So we had a number of things that kicked in, in the quarter and we continue to see it raise the bar, right. So for me, it's a continued journey. First intervention is the mobile dimension which you touched on. So optimizing the mobile experience through both better site navigation and better search functionality. The second piece is, we launched Apple Pay, right. And we want make sure that we have all the payment approaches that our target consumers want to use. The third area is, as we looked at our email segmentation, we were more precise in our email targeting and so we are seeing some benefits from that and I expect that to actually strengthen over time. And then the last one, which is important because we want to make sure we provide great customer service, we moved to actually 24/4 customer service call support during this quarter and obviously we are going to continue to do that. And then as you look at the next phases of capability that we are building on the site, continuing to build out the mobile functionality, personalization, big focus areas for us. And then the whole connected retail piece, whether it's buy online, find in store and buy online store, pickup in store. So those have been drivers that have helped our business this past quarter. The progress was, remember last time we talked about how there is a bifurcation between our domestic consumers and our international business. So our domestic consumer progress was solid this quarter. Our international business continues to be pressured because of the foreign exchange dynamics and because of the import restrictions, particularly in China and in Korea. Jane Nielsen : Yes. I would just add that we expect that some of that international pressure will continue through the balance of this year. Patrice Louvet : Will continue, yes, right. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Dana Telsey : Hi. Good morning everyone. And I also want to say congratulation on the nice progress. As you think about Hong Kong and obviously the uncertainty there, how you are planning that going forward? The down 27% that you had this quarter, how do you see that progressing? And then on new channels of distribution that you mentioned, Patrice, how do you balance out new channels with wholesale? Where do you see the endgame winding up with wholesale as a percent of sales and perhaps some of these new channels? And is there a margin differential? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Dana, why don't I start on Hong Kong and then I will turn it over to Patrice. So as we look at Hong Kong this quarter, it was about a three point pressure to overall Asia comp. As we look forward to Q3, we are expecting that pressure to accelerate and it will be about four to five points of negative impact on Asia comp as we move forward. We have seen like many others, the tourist falloff has accelerated and door closures due to protest, we don't expect to improve. And it's embedded in our guidance for Q3. Patrice Louvet : And then on the channel play. So listen, we have a very simple principle. We want to be where the consumer wants to shop us. And it's clear that there is new model that consumers are excited about where we want to play. So rental, subscription, retail, all right. So on rental, I think we have actually been on rental runway for several months. We just started on Nuuly. We are excited about that. And there are other platforms that we are looking at. Initial results are quite encouraging. So very early days, but encouraged by the progress. Subscription, whether that's Stitch Fix or Trunk Club, are also performing well for us and we want make sure we are there and we play to win there. And then we are starting on retail. We had an activity with Depop in the U.K. where results were quite encouraging. And obviously given the nature of our brand, timelessness, basically more style driven than seasonal fashion driven, more focus on quality, we think we are actually very well-positioned to play to win in that segment. Listen, your crystal ball is going to be as good as mine, Dana, on this one in terms of what share of the business it will be down the road. The consumer, I think, will tell us that based on their behaviors and the services that we can offer. But our mindset is, we want to build an ecosystem that's consumer centric and within that ecosystem wholesale still has a very important to play, both brick-and-mortar and.com. And so we want make sure we are where the consumer expects us to be. We are well set up for success in those channels where the brand can show up in the right way as well as in the developing new channels. I think the key thing from me here and I am very proud of the work that the teams are doing here, is the agility that the organization is demonstrating because typically we wouldn't necessarily be as nimble on some of these new opportunities. And I think there has been a lot of wonderful work done internally to take advantage of these opportunities and to have a bit of a first-mover advantage on some of them. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Last question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Co. Your line is open. Rick Patel : Good morning and well done managing the tough environment. I had a question on marketing. So it sounds like some of the efforts to leverage the targeted performance channels are working very well. Should we expect more of this in the back half? And does that mean that you will move away from some of the brand-building investment you have made in the past? Or should marketing grow across all channels? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Thank you Rick. Well, listen, first of all, our end goal is one-to-one marketing, right. I mean that's where we want to go. Now that's probably a few years away still. But that's certainly the personalization journey we are on across all elements of our marketing. So you will see, no, we are not going to get down to quarter-by-quarter specifics on this, but you will see us continue to increase personalization focused both mobile, on our site and in our email activities, so that the page that you get when you sign on to our site is dramatically different than the page that I get when I sign on. That will not be done at the expense of overall brand-building activities like our shows, like our partnerships with sports, like our limited editions. But it's really about being more efficient in the way we spend our money. And I think what we will find with personalization is actually we will be able to be a lot more effective and efficient with each dollar being spent. We are still on the trajectory to get to 5% of sales expense in marketing by the end of the five-year phase. We expect marketing to continue to grow ahead of revenue this year as well, just like we had over the past two fiscal years. So think of us playing across the pallet of marketing tools, but indeed with a deliberate focus on ultimately getting to one-to-one marketing. Jane Nielsen : And expect marketing dollars to grow in the second half, Rick. Patrice Louvet : All right. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our third quarter fiscal 2020 results with you in early February. And in the meantime, have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. We continue to make strong progress on our Next Great Chapter plan with third quarter results, ahead of our overall expectations, including better-than-expected revenues, operating margin and double-digit EPS growth. Over the important holiday season, our teams consistently executed across each of our strategic priorities, enabling us to elevate our brand and deliver for our consumers across every touch point. The solid foundations we've put into place to reposition and elevate our brands, helped to drive positive comp growth across all three regions, excluding the impact of Hong Kong this quarter. We were also encouraged by AUR growth of 6% as we invest in brand elevation through our products, marketing, distribution and unique consumer experiences. At the same time, we continue to execute key initiatives to stabilize our North America business against an evolving retail landscape. As I've shared before, the three principles underlying this work include, putting the consumer at the center of everything we do; elevating the brand across all consumer touch points and balancing growth and productivity. And we are doing all of this while managing through volatile industry dynamics, including the recent coronavirus outbreak, which we are actively monitoring. Our top priorities are to keep our employees and consumers safe and to heed the advice of local and international health authorities. The situation is a dynamic one and we will continue to assess the implications for our business across retail, corporate and our supply base. Our thoughts are with the many impacted by this virus. During the third quarter, we drove our performance across the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our five-year plan to deliver long-term, sustainable growth and value creation. These include, first, win over a new generation of consumers, second energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories, third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to show growth. Starting with win over a new generation of consumers. We're investing in media channels that matter most to consumers today, namely, digital and social and remain on track towards our long-term marketing investment target of 5% of sales. In the third quarter, marketing increased 16% to last year as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period. We are encouraged by consumer engagement across generations through our campaigns and programs. Notably, our total social media followers surpassed 40 million in the third quarter, a double-digit increase to last year led by a 30% organic increase on Instagram. Let me touch on some of the highlights from our holiday campaigns this quarter. First, we launched a fully integrated holiday campaign across social media, television, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments, which we called Every Moment is a Gift. Among the exciting activations online, we drove strong engagement through our Snapchat holiday shopping filter and our first ever global digital game, The Holiday Run where our iconic Polo bear dash through the streets of New York City, Paris and Tokyo to collect festive bubbles and signature Ralph Lauren products. We also launched a digitally-targeted campaign for our Lauren women's ready-to-wear business in North America this season, featuring supermodel and mom, Lily Aldridge along with her family. It was the first dedicated campaign for the brand in many years that had significant media support behind it. We were encouraged by the early consumer response as we work to get the Lauren women's business back on a positive trajectory. On our North American mobile app, we drove a successful 7Days/7Drops program, featuring limited edition releases and one-of-the-kind experiences. A highlight of the week was our 5 Horseman Rugby shirt, which sold out in just 15 minutes online. And congratulations to Ralph Lauren Golf Ambassador Justin Thomas. He captured his 12th career win at the Century Tournament of Champions last month, wearing RLX to capture the number one spot in the FedEx Cup standings. Moving on to our second key initiative energize core products and accelerate high-potential underdeveloped categories. In the third quarter, Ralph and our design team drove excitement in core product categories, while also expanding into our five high-potential underdeveloped categories. While we were pleased with the overall performance of these categories, our outerwear and fleece programs were the clear standouts this holiday outperforming our total sales trends on both the sell-in and sell-out basis. Popular styles included heavyweight parkas, quilted car coats, light and midway down jackets, windbreakers and sharper styles. Other successes this season included woven shirts, sweaters and denim. In addition to the holiday drops in our mobile app, we released our limited edition Polo sports outdoors collection in November. The products retailed on our own digital commerce sites North America app and select flagship stores around the world. We also partnered with influential specialty retailers including Bodega, Fred Segal, Essence, Browns in the U.K., and Beams in Asia. Other exciting projects this quarter included an exclusive holiday capsule with Zalando, the Polo Sport collaboration with Musinsa, one of the largest fashion online retailers in Korea, and the Wechat mini program for Singles Day, in China. Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions, and channels. Our long-term expansion strategy remains focused on building a cohesive, elevated Ralph Lauren experience, across our retail, wholesale, and digital commerce presence in key cities around the world. During the third quarter, we opened 48 new owned and operated stores and concessions globally, and close 31 locations. This included 37 openings in Asia. We also continue to invest in door refreshes across our own stores and wholesale partners in key markets, as we work to elevate our fleet across every touch point. Our city-by-city ecosystem approach drove strong results in the quarter, with Chinese Mainland sales up more than 30% in constant currency, driven by comp growth, and new stores. Total China sales were up 6% to last year in constant currency, despite headwinds in Hong Kong, that we discussed last quarter. In Europe, we opened six owned and partnered full-price stores, including Polo boutiques, in Covent Garden in London, Torino, Exxon Province and Lisbon. We're making good progress, but we still have significant expansion opportunities with only 46 full-price stores across Europe, with all of this complemented by our successful expansion into new specialty wholesale accounts and digital commerce growth. Which brings me to our fourth key initiative, lead with digital. Our global digital ecosystem including our directly operated flagship sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased low-double digits in the third quarter in constant currency. The strong performance exceeded our expectations across all three regions. This was driven by double-digit growth in Europe and Asia, with North America up high-single digits, improving from flat performance in the first half. Starting with Europe, digital sales were up high-teens in the quarter, with solid performance across both owned and wholesale digital accounts, led by digital pure-play retailers. We added six new partners, including LuisaViaRoma in Italy, SockShop in the U.K. and Brown Hamburg, in Germany. Our directly operated digital sites in Europe also saw further momentum, delivering 15% comp growth this quarter. Highlights included the November launch of Polo mobile app in the U.K., our first app launch outside of North America, and the new digital commerce flagship for Switzerland, as we expand our localization efforts by market. In Asia, digital ecosystem sales were also up double-digits, led by the Chinese Mainland. We launched new partnerships this quarter with, Myer in Australia, as well as Tmall's luxury selected platform in China. Lastly, our digital growth in China accelerated on the launch of buy online, ship from store fulfillment to leverage our store inventories. These omni-channel orders contributed to roughly half, of our digital growth in the quarter. Turning to North America, third quarter comps on ralphlauren.com were up 6%, largely in line with our expectations. We saw softness from international consumers due to FX and import restrictions in Asia, similar to the first half of the year. However, sales to domestic shoppers grew single-digits as we started to drive improvements in mobile, tight personalization and rebalancing our buys to emphasize stronger selling core and seasonal core products. Lastly, we continue to build partnerships with newer digital platforms in North America, which are extending our reach to new and younger consumers. In the third quarter, we launched Women's Polo on Daily Look, the premium subscription-based personal styling service; and Men's Polo on Simmons, a specialty designer boutique online. We also added kids to Rent the Runway joining our Lauren, Women's Polo and Club Monaco brands on the platform. Touching on our fifth key initiative, operate with discipline to show growth. In the third quarter, we focused on challenging every cost and improving our efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points, slightly ahead of our expectations with stronger than expected top-line growth, partly offset by the planned timing of higher investments around holiday marketing and new stores. One important margin driver for us and a central part of our Next Great Chapter strategy is raising AUR to elevate the brand globally and create value. We're using multiple levers to realize AUR increases, including lower discounts, elevated product mix, geographic and channel shifts and strategic ticket price increases. We began phasing in strategic ticket price increases in our North America factory outlet channel in late September, followed by our North America full price wholesale and direct-to-consumer doors in spring 2020. Leveraging the success, we've had implementing this strategy in Asia and Europe, these ticket increases reflect our competitive benchmarking analysis and our focus on providing a superior value proposition for our consumers. We were encouraged by the impact of these initial price increases this fall. While traffic was still a headwind for our factory business, we were able to drive positive comps in this channel through an 8% increase in AUR in the quarter. This was on top of 8% AUR growth last year and well above our expectations. Though it is still early in this journey, we are focused on elevating our brand positioning in the North American market and globally as part of our AUR-led strategy. And finally, I want to provide an update on our journey to further integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. More than 50 years ago, Ralph built our company based on the idea of timelessness, creating products that are meant to be worn, loved, and passed on to the next generation. This continues to inspire everything we do as we build the business to deliver value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for the next 50 years. As part of this work, in December, we announced a new commitment to power all of our globally owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We also took the Arctic shipping pledge committing to reroute shipping to avoid the environmentally delicate Artic area. Driving diversity and inclusion across our business is another important piece of this work, and we are pleased to report that we have achieved our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than three years ahead of our target. In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's execution over the important holiday quarter and we are encouraged by the progress we are making on our Next Great Chapter plan across the business. While we are mindful of the challenges across our markets globally, we are intensely focused on delivering on the commitments we have made across every aspect of our business as we look to drive long-term, sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. And before I turn it over to Jane, sadly I want to note the recent passing of our longtime board member and friend, Arnold Aronson. On behalf of Ralph and the entire organization, I want to express our deepest gratitude for his kindness, wisdom and service to our company over nearly two decades. Now, over to Jane and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season and our team's agility and navigating a dynamic global, geopolitical and retail environment. We delivered top and bottom-line growth and good progress across key metrics, including 6%, AUR growth, double digit growth in digital commerce and growth and operating margin expansion, coupled with solid inventory control. Third quarter revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. Every region posted positive revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit constant currency growth in Europe and Asia despite the ongoing headwinds in Hong Kong, as well as slight growth in North America. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong, total company topline grew 2.5% in constant currency and every region delivered positive comps as we work to elevate our brand across every consumer touch point, drive product quality, reduce promotional levels and enhance our digital presence. Adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points in the third quarter, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross margins benefited from AUR growth of 6% on better pricing, lower promotions and elevated product mix, along with favorable channel and geographic mix, these more than offset investments in product elevation and sustainability and diversification of our supply chain. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the early results of our fall pricing actions and expect our AUR strength to continue through the rest of the year, driving our full year expectation of low single digit AUR growth for fiscal 2020. Our inventory positions for both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses are current and well controlled coming out of this holiday season. And we remain focused on managing our inventories with discipline and leveraging our supply chain agility and responsiveness. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 14%, up 10 basis points on a reported basis and in constant currency. Adjusted operating profit dollars grew 3% to last year. Adjusted operating expense increased to 48.2% of sales, up 50 basis points to last year was on a reported basis and in constant currency. Marketing was the key driver with spending up 16% in the quarter, as we shifted investments back into the key holiday selling period versus last year's focus on our 50th anniversary show and related events in the second quarter. We still expect marketing spend to grow ahead of sales for the full year fiscal 2020 as we invest behind our brands with an emphasis on digital media. Excluding marketing, our adjusted operating expense leveraged 20 basis points to last year as our teams generated operating efficiencies across our business.  Some key highlights from third quarter include : first, we continue to drive efficiencies across our end-to-end supply chain including incremental savings across facilities, labor, airfreight and consolidation of materials, all contributing to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This work is also delivering an improved experience for our consumers including faster delivery speeds on digital orders. Over the peak holiday period for example we more than doubled our penetration of orders delivered in two days or less over the prior year. We also piloted a new fast track model in the quarter where we were able to meaningfully accelerate the development of special product concepts from design to shelf. Leveraging our investments in digital product development, we designed, produced and delivered an exclusive fleece sweater to a key wholesale customer in just 16 days, right in time for Black Friday. While just one early example, we expect this model to be a growing part of our supply chain as we continue our progress toward our three, six, and nine-month lead-time targets. Moving on to segment performance starting with North America. Revenue increased slightly in the third quarter as strong growth in our retail business more than offset wholesale revenue declines. Adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, a 30 basis point decrease to last year with operating margin expansion in our retail businesses more than offset by SG&A deleverage in our wholesale business on lower sales. In the retail channel in North America comps were up 4% and ahead of our expectations driven by 4% brick-and-mortar comps and 6% comps on our owned digital commerce site. Brick-and-mortar comps were driven by an 8% increase in AUR on top of 7% growth last year. This strong growth reflects our targeted price increases and a reduction in promotions along with an improved product offering, new marketing activations and rebalanced assortments towards stronger selling core and underpenetrated categories. We also made key operational improvements such as the roll-out of RFID technology across our fleet to improve out-of-stock replenishment sales. In addition, new staffing optimization tools in our stores drove productivity and improved service in peak periods. Our factory business led our AUR increase in North America with improved conversion. While traffic continued to be a headwind in the channel, we are focused on driving better traffic trends through enhanced digital marketing and refreshed and differentiated store experiences. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business were up 6%. Our investments in mobile, personalization and site navigation drove positive growth from domestic consumers in the third quarter. Our digital business also benefited from favorable product mix towards categories like outerwear and fleece along with a timing shift into the third quarter as we saw higher sell-through in the holiday period, versus clearance period, in Q4. Excluding this shift, we still expect second half comps to improve incrementally compared to first half comps. Sales to international shoppers purchasing on our U.S. site and shipping to U.S. addresses remained soft, in the third quarter and should remain a headwind through the rest of fiscal 2020. Moving on to North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations. Excluding a decline in off-price sales, our underlying North America wholesale business was also down high-single digits. However, our full price sellout improved from recent trends. In the near-term, we are focused on improving the consumer experience in the wholesale channel, through in-store refreshes, expansion into under-penetrated categories and increased marketing. Our inventories in the wholesale channel are clean and down, on a year-over-year basis. We are driving a more favorable product mix, emphasizing core categories and testing targeted brand marketing, for Lauren Women's. We continue to expect, it will take some time for our wholesale business to start reflecting these strategic improvements, which have shown success in our direct-to-consumer channels. Moving on to Europe, third quarter revenue was up 3% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. Adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points both a reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin expansion was driven by strong gross margins and SG&A leverage. In retail channels in Europe comps were up 3% driven by a 15% increase in our own digital commerce sites. And a 2% increase in our brick-and-mortar stores. The increase in our directly operated European digital commerce business was above our expectation, driven by strong AUR growth, solid merchandising execution and traffic increases along with the shift in seasonal product sales, similar to our North America site. Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand and improve product mix, continued in the third quarter, with AUR up 10% on top of an 11% increase last year. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization, in the marketplace. Wholesale revenue in Europe was up 5% in constant currency and also ahead of our expectations. Similar to Q2, the strong performance reflected solid sell-out trends driving stronger reorders, particularly with our digital pure-play partners. Turning to Asia, revenue was up 5%, on both a reported and constant currency basis in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of Hong Kong where protest-related store closures and tourism declines were an ongoing headwind, Asia revenues were up 9%. This solid performance was driven by several markets in Asia, led by Chinese Mainland sales growth of over 30%, in constant currency. Our product and marketing initiatives are resonating well in this region. And we continue to drive our digital efforts, expand and elevate our store fleet. And engage with local influencers and celebrities. Comps in Asia decreased 1%, with slight AUR declines. Excluding Hong Kong, Asia comps were up 2%. Store closures and traffic decline to Hong Kong remained a challenge in the third quarter, but we were able to partially mitigate some of this impact by pulling forward a friends-and-family event in our factory stores. We continue to expect Hong Kong to remain a near-term headwind, especially with the emerging impact of the coronavirus, as Patrice mentioned. Adjusted operating margin was down 50 basis points to last year on a reported basis, and down 70 basis points in constant currency driven by SG&A deleverage in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, margins were up 130 basis points in constant currency. Moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $687 million in debt at the end of last year's third quarter. We repurchased $98 million in shares in the third quarter for a total of $498 million in repurchases year-to-date. We will continue to opportunistically buy back stock and remain on track to complete our target of about $600 million in repurchases for full fiscal 2020. Moving on to inventory, at the end of the third quarter inventory was down 1% to last year and flat in constant currency. We still expect to end the year with inventories relatively aligned to our sales outlook. Now, I'd like to turn to guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this guidance excludes restructuring and related charges, and reflects our best assessment of the global retail landscape in the context of increased volatility from macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Specifically, our outlook still incorporates the impact of tariffs, Brexit and protest-related business disruption in Hong Kong. At this early stage, our guidance does not include potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak given the dynamic nature of the situation. However, we are monitoring developments closely and will be transparent about the expected impact providing updates if needed. For full year fiscal 2020, we still expect revenues to be in the range of 2% to 3% growth in constant currency. Based on a better than expected holiday, revenue should be slightly better than the low-end of the range we guided to last quarter. Foreign currency is expected to have about 110 to 130 basis points of negative impact on revenue growth based on currency shifts. We now expect operating margin expansion at the high-end of our previous range of 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion and slight SG&A leverage. Foreign currency is estimated to have about 10 basis points of negative impact on operating margin in fiscal 2020. Based on the timing of shipments, our guidance now assumes a little less than $10 million of negative tariff impact to our fiscal 2020 cost of goods. We expect the majority of this impact in our fourth quarter. However, based on our supply chain diversification out of China and recent tariff reductions, we estimate tariffs will have about $12 million to $15 million of total impact in fiscal 2021. We now expect our full year tax rate to be about 20%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be up slightly both on a constant currency and on a reported basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 50 basis points in the quarter. We expect protest disruptions in Hong Kong to negatively impact our Asia comp by about five points in the quarter. Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be up slightly in constant currency and on a reported basis. Similar to Q3, this is primarily due to timing of SG&A investments with our highest number of new store openings weighted to the back half of the year, largely offsetting gross margin expansion in the quarter. Fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 26% above our full year expected rate based on our expectation of discrete onetime items. We look forward to sharing the details of our fiscal 2021 guidance when we report our fiscal year-end in May. In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion, our teams around the world demonstrated this holiday quarter. Guided by Ralph's vision, our teams elevated our brand, delivering comp AUR and profit growth, all while maintaining disciplined on inventories and costs. While we are navigating and watching the challenges in the broader environment closely, we are first and foremost committed to the safety of our employees', partners and consumers. We believe we have the right strategy and team to deliver across our strategic priorities and create value for the long-term. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays Capital. Adrienne Yih : Good morning and congratulations on continued progress in a very tough environment. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Adrienne. Thank you. Adrienne Yih : Good morning. So Patrice, I wanted to -- you gave such great color on sort of the AUR and what was driving the pricing increases. It's accelerated in the back half of the year from the first half despite the tougher compares. Obviously, you talked about where you were taking selective price increases. What have you learned about the price elasticity particularly in North America? And does this give you confidence in your ability to continue to take pricing up over the next year or so? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Great. Thank you for your question. Well, let me just step back a little bit to kind of give you the overall with how we're thinking about this. The first thing I would say is, brand elevation is really at the core of our strategy, right and AUR is obviously then a key component to that. The second point on AUR is we have four drivers for AUR that we're working on. One is pulling back on promotional support. And actually in the last quarter, we reduced our promotional pressure. The second is leveraging product mix and you saw us invest in categories that had higher AUR like outerwear and fleece. The third is obviously leveraging geographic and channel mix. And then the final point is indeed targeted pricing. Now we've actually started this journey of taking target pricing in the context of this broader AUR strategy. In international I'd say past 18, 24-months and we've been pleased with the results that we've achieved there. But it's really important to understand that it isn't just pricing in isolation. It's the result of work that we've done on elevating the brand across all the touch points. The work we've done on inventory, on product, on brand from distribution that enables that. We are at a stage now where we think the conditions are set for us to execute that in North America. So as you mentioned we now have about a quarter under our belt in the factory outlet channel which is where we started. We're encouraged both by the way the teams have executed, they've done a terrific job, and the consumer response across the board because we saw significant AUR growth. Now AUR growth in isolation doesn't make any -- growth that needs to drive comps and we're pleased with the 4% comp growth that we achieved in North America. In terms of then expanding this across the ecosystem for North America the plan is actually to do that now. So, literally as we speak, we are implementing pricing for the consumer on the floors both in our full-price stores that have wholesale, leveraging the learnings that we've picked up in our execution in factory outlets. And we're at the very beginning of this journey we were quite encouraged by what we've seen so far. And to the point on your guidance long-term relative to our expectations for AUR growth, we continue to expect AUR to grow low to mid-single digits throughout the lifetime of the plan. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Let me start with congrats on a really nice quarter and what sounds like a tough holiday. Patrice Louvet : Hi, Michael. Jane Nielsen : Hi, Michael. Michael Binetti : I want to ask you in North America wholesale down 8% -- was a bigger decline than we've seen since maybe fourth quarter last year and you were going against big off price correction in the fourth quarter last year, lapping a negative 10. I kind of -- if I add this to you know some comments you just made on now starting to raise prices in wholesale. I am trying think how you guys think about the North America wholesale numbers going forward from here obviously the compare gets easier, you\u2019ve got some pricing but then, due you think we are a point where we can -- you can see turning a corner on North America wholesale turning positive yet at some point during the course of fiscal 2021? And then I also want to ask you about how you're thinking through all the dynamics you just laid out about margins for next year. It sounds like you're happy with how the increased marketing is going. Obviously, the results are there on the top-line. But I'm wondering how your thinking about gross margin as well for next year, which has been a nice contributor for several years now. I mean you did say AUR should keep moving in the right place you're happy with ticket. So, I'm wondering if we can -- if you still think the gross margin and SG&A dynamics we've seen in the first two years the plan should be similar next year. Jane Nielsen : Yes, Michael, it's Jane. So, let me answer the AUR gross margin question first and then I'll go to North America wholesale. So, we're really encouraged with we saw in North America in Q3 from a gross margin standpoint, led by the AUR increases with comp growth. Those AUR increases really reflected our ability to both continue our discount reduction journey. We are starting to see a nice contribution from product mix and the elevation of products. Better assortments, better rebalancing in the core the things we've been talking about. So early stages, but we're starting to see that in this quarter. And then the consumer response to, the ticket increases were also very positive. So, that's what's giving me confidence, in continued gross margin expansion. Obviously, we've guided that for Q4. But I do think that the things that we've called out as durable, reductions in promotions, targeted consumer value-oriented price increases, product mix benefits. And then, some tailwind benefits from geographic and channel shifts, those things are durable. And we're able to manage some of the cost inflation. And tariff impact through the work -- through working those levers. So, I continue to remain optimistic that gross margin is a driver for us today. Obviously, we have guided to for the future. But it's also durable to the plan. Now the magnitude will have -- we're pretty clear on our guidance. But I'm encouraged and I think its strength for us. So, good progress there. Then, if I turn to your North America wholesale question, I would tell you that again off-price was down, I would say meaningfully more than our full-price business, so double-digit decline last year, double-digit decline this year. And again, the flow of off-price is related to excess flow. Our inventory is clean. And so we're really I think looking at that channel from a strategic standpoint than where it should be which, is the good partners to us. They're an opportunistic way for us to liquidate excess. And that's what you're seeing come through. In terms of the timing of North America wholesale covering, we know that that will take some time, right? So what is encouraging to us is that we're on the right track, strong comp growth in DTC in North America, this quarter. The underlying trend is encouraging. Well, I still think quarter-by-quarter there will be some choppiness, the underlying trend is encouraging and we believe that we're taking the right actions wholesale, as Patrice called out in terms of rebalancing assortments, focusing on sell-out which we did see improve, this quarter. And we're starting some targeted marketing within the channel, that's showing some very early signs of positive trends. So, we're pleased with that. And we're overall pleased with our marketing investments. And the way they're enabling our brand elevation and price increases. So, still encourages how that will flow through on OI margin. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank You. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Patrice Louvet : Thanks, Matt. Matthew Boss : Maybe Patrice and I know this is somewhat higher level. But, as we think about differentiated versus undifferentiated retail, I guess maybe what inning overall do you see the brand today in North America? So, maybe if you could touch on wholesale distribution, how you feel about your existing department store doors, maybe the number and the quality of the doors that you're in. I know Jane just touched on off-price. And then at retail, where you see the opportunity from a footprint perspective in terms of what you have today and the opportunity that you have going forward? Patrice Louvet : Jane is very happy that we're back to baseball analogies. So listen, on the differentiation front, I think we're in the very early innings in North America actually, right. So, if you'd ask me for a number, I'd probably say two out of nine. I think we see opportunities to actually in the context of the brand elevation strategy to increase our presence in higher end wholesale where we see opportunities both in North America and actually around the world. We're also in kind of the current wholesale footprint you know we've reduced it significantly already, right. We're down 25% from where we were about three years ago to make sure that the brand shows up in the right place. We continue to assess the locations on a very regular basis working closely with our partners. So, this is also a dynamic process. As far as DTC is concerned, we believe we have opportunities obviously to continue to fuel our dot-com operations right, which is a very important factor of the DTC part of our business. And also similar to our thinking internationally with the introduction of Polo boutiques, we believe there is an opportunity in North America to expand our DTC footprint smaller format stores. So that won't happen tomorrow morning. But as we look at kind of the next few years and where we want to take the brand and how we want to drive interactions with consumers across the country, we do believe there are opportunities to expand the footprint so that the brand is better represented in a more dispersed way across the entire country, all guided by our brand elevation strategy, right. That's really the filter that we use to decide where we should be and then how do we ensure the differentiation is very clear by channel for the consumer both online and brick-and-mortar, so that he or she knows exactly what to get in which location and how the brand will show up differently based on the different environments. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks. I\u2019d add my congratulations, nice quarter guys. I appreciate all the information. Patrice Louvet : Thanks Omar. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask a follow-up on the sales guidance. You obviously a really strong quarter your comps accelerated. You came in above your number. You kind of kept the full year guidance the same. Are there any timing issues going on? Especially with all the AUR upticks, it feels like an easier comparison in the fiscal fourth quarter. It feels like there could be some opportunity for revenue upside there. Is there something I'm missing? And then, a follow-up on the coronavirus and maybe it's related. We're hearing stories of double-digit million population cities that are like ghost towns right now and some pretty significant comp declines. Wondering if you're seeing any meaningful impact in your business in real time? And is there anything on the supply chain side we should think about in terms of disruption there potentially? Thanks. Jane Nielsen : All right. Why don't I unpack your question in terms of the guidance first and in terms of revenue upside? What we are seeing, and I think we called it out in the script is obviously Hong Kong will have a more meaningful impact as we head into the fourth quarter. We've seen travel bookings deteriorate from the third to the fourth quarter and this is obviously a big quarter for Hong Kong, given that it was a Lunar New Year. And so we called out that we had about a three-point impact to Asia comp in the third quarter that leads to about a five-point impact in the fourth quarter. So, that's one factor this going into that. And then we called out some digital commerce that we had a very big stronger-than-expected digital commerce. As we look at that and underneath the covers of that in both Europe and in North America, what we saw is that we sold out stronger at full price. We had less inventory seeding clearance in the fourth quarter. That's a good quality of sales move and we're pleased with this. And so, you'll see some of that sitting on our digital comps in the fourth quarter as we move forward. We also have some -- given the shorter holiday season. We move to fulfill demand to make sure consumers had a good service experience. And we'll have slight -- we'll have some more process returns in the fourth quarter and we were less promotional at the end of the third quarter. So, those are some things that are sitting in digital. So those two things are the biggest things that are guiding our fourth quarter revenue call. Patrice Louvet : And then on the coronavirus and obviously, it's a highly dynamic situation, right? But if we take a snapshot, today for us in China, we have about half of our fleets closed. So about -- we are about 110 stores, so roughly half of that is closed as we speak today. Obviously, we monitor that very closely. As far as supply chain is concerned, well first the other thing I would say relative to our business penetration in China just for the benefit of the whole group is, while the China opportunity is a massive growth opportunity for us to some extent, it's a blessing to be underpenetrated today because our business today China represents less than 4% of the total company business. Now, we still are very bullish about our ability to win long-term in that region and very excited about what we can do there. On the supply chain front, I'd say same thing on a very dynamic situation. We have been working as you know over the past year, two years to diversify our supply chain, so that we're less dependent on one market, less dependent on China. So we have a greater ability to leverage a footprint that's much broader and much more flexible. We're in the middle of the Lunar New Year vacation. We'll need to see and which has been extended by week. We'll need to see how employees return to the various factories post the vacation. So we're watching it. We are working on being as agile as possible and we'll make sure we make the best of the situation that we're dealing with. The priority in all of this right because this is a human -- we can't lose sight of the human dimension of all. This obviously is to make sure that our employees are safe, our consumers are safe and that we follow very closely the guidance both from the local and the global authorities on this health crisis. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great, thanks, good morning. Just a couple of questions for me. I guess Patrice, just on the speed to market opportunities you gave that 16-day example. Could you just talk a little bit more about where that product was produced? And as you assess the opportunity, how repeatable is this process? And then, just a follow-up for Jane on the North American wholesale, can you talk a little bit more during the quarter of what did you see with Men's Polo versus Lauren within the full price business? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : So Erinn, I just took note of that example. That's actually really good. You know -- it was a pilot exercise for us. It was a sweat shirt that we developed with one of our wholesale partners. And we did execute it from ideas to delivery to the partner in 16 days. We're not going to move our entire supply chain to 16 days. What's key our lens is to understand what is the timing required to be well-positioned to win a specific category, in a specific geography, in a specific channel? So we still have kind of our nine, six, three-month lead-times. And then there are some projects where we want to have this ability to react in the span of days. The specific project Erinn so sweatshirt I believe manufactured in Mainland China. And something that's replicable which is why we shared it as an example. It's a pilot, but I think it's an indication also that our organization is becoming more agile, more aggressive in terms of how we manage time lines and also more creative. So, I think you're going to continue to see from us faster lead-times not just for the sake of lead-times also just to understand what's required to win in the marketplace. Jane Nielsen : And Erinn, I would just add that we remain confident in the -- in achieving the goal that we laid out at Investor Day that we will get to more than 50% of our product on a six-month or less lead-time and we're making great progress on some of our key categories in moving almost 80% of our quarter on to six months or less and even working on faster track. So great progress by our supply chain in that area. And then to the second part of your question, regarding what we're seeing -- what we saw on Polo and the Lauren brands. We did see across the company that the Polo brand really drove our -- and we saw -- and it's specifically in North America wholesale we saw the Polo brand be stable and a driver for us. The Lauren brand -- we're seeing some positive times, but they're very early based on the marketing that Patrice called out and some targeted work that we're doing with our wholesale partners that one makes us believe that the Lauren opportunity is an opportunity in North America wholesale that our consumer is still there, and that when we assort into the right categories with the right product quality and right consumer value that the consumer will respond. And so we saw some encouraging trends there. I'd say too early to call the turnaround. It will take some time but it's an encouraging sign. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Alex Walvis : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Alex. Alex Walvis : You commented on some pretty strong performance in the outerwear segment through the quarter which was a tough category for some others. So some good progress there. I wonder if you could share some comments on the other underdeveloped categories. And you mentioned denim was strong. Any comment on where we are in the progression for accessories, but where -- wear to work and so forth? Patrice Louvet : Sure. Yes, we were actually really encouraged by the growth on outerwear. And frankly, I'm becoming even more bullish on the size of price on that part of the business as we build capabilities in-house. So, good momentum on outerwear. Denim also performed well for us. And that actually contributed to the solid trends, on our men's business. I think the team is doing a very good job, in terms of understanding the customer we want to serve, developing product that resonates, and then finding a way to communicate and execute it in-store, in a way that really connects with the consumer. We're making good progress on wear-to-work. Probably the key thing to highlight here is the way we are complementing our line on -- particularly on Polo Women's. And some of the work that's also underway on Lauren, to really make sure that we have the right offering, to meet that kind of wear-to-work consumer need, so good progress there. And if you remember, this is an oversimplified. But we really want to shift to being a kind of seven day brand solution as opposed to maybe two or three days, a week, both for men and women. So I'm encouraged by the progress we're making there. As far as footwear and accessories, so we had talked about the fact that Investor Day that footwear and accessories progress and impact would be more back loaded in the five-year program, which is why you're seeing further acceleration on outerwear and denim first. But we are making good progress on footwear and accessories. Job one, first is really building capability right, working with Ralph, and having the right design talent both on bags and on shoes. We brought some extraordinary talent from key players in this space that have joined us over the past year, year and a half. So, that we make sure we've got people that really understand fundamentally, how these categories work. And then, now working on bringing these products to life, in the market, these things take a bit of time. So, I expect the impact to be most visible in the outer years of the plan. But we're starting to see some encouraging signs on different parts of the portfolio, that give us confidence that we're making, the right progress and that we will see the benefits that we expect from those two categories, as well. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Last question please, Angela. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Rick Patel with Needham & Co. Rick Patel : Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me, and I'll add my congrats as well. I was hoping you could provide some more color on Europe wholesale. You reported some nice growth there despite the negative impact of some timing shifts. Is there anything to call out aside from digital wholesale accounts? And how sustainable is this growth as we think about the run rate for this segment? Jane Nielsen : I think we're encouraged. We've been consistently calling out our Europe wholesale underlying trend is being in the range of what we called out for the long-term sort of in that low to mid-single-digit growth. Obviously, our pure-play partners are leading that growth. But we're also encouraged with what we're seeing in our core bricks -- more traditional bricks-and-mortar partners in terms of their trajectory both on a comp basis. So store -- same-store sales growth within those areas and some distribution expansion that we're seeing on a more regional basis with partners that we've had for from a number of years, so that's very encouraging to us. I think we see this as durable growth. And we're encouraged by the progress that we're making, and where the brand sits within the wholesale European ecosystem. I think it's elevated. The pricing is accretive to our overall portfolio. And our inventories are in good shape there. So, we're very pleased with the progress in that business. Patrice Louvet : Good. So thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our fiscal year end results and fiscal year 2021 guidance with you on our next call in early May. Between now and then, have a great time. Thank you. Bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Corinna. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. The spread of COVID-19 around the world has been devastating, and our thoughts are with the many impacted by the virus. The pandemic has not only affected our organization and recent financial performance, but it has had unprecedented consequences on the communities we operate in around the world. Under these extraordinary circumstances, our teams have responded to the call with agility and resilience working tirelessly from their living rooms and kitchen tables across time zones. Ralph and I want to recognize and thank them for their dedication and commitment. Our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. And before we review our recent financial performance, I want to spend some time on the actions we are taking to ensure we not only endure through this crisis but are positioned to thrive long-term. From the start of the outbreak, we moved quickly to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees, consumers, and communities. This included widespread store and office closures led by Asia in late January, followed by Europe and North America in March. Like many of you, we are working in new ways across the company, including working from home, and we've implemented new health and safety measures where that is not possible. We also took proactive steps to ensure the long-term financial health of our business, including expense reductions, further strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity, and pivoting our supply chain to adjust inventories to changing demand. Meanwhile, we accelerated efforts to drive sales to our digital ecosystem as consumers stayed home. On the expense side, we've been addressing our most significant fixed cost around the world. This includes ongoing work with our landlords to negotiate rent relief and pausing all new store build-outs. We reduced corporate expenses, including a freeze on our global travel and hiring during the crisis. And in April we announced pay cuts for executives, Board, and me along with furloughing or flexing down a significant number of our employees across the company. Ralph is foregoing his bonus for fiscal 2020 and his entire salary for fiscal 2021. We have also focused on delivering on our purpose in the communities in which we operate. For example, in March we donated $10 million toward emergency COVID relief through our Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation. These funds will support the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, our longstanding partners in cancer care, our employee relief fund to support Ralph Lauren employees in need, and the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund for COVID-19 relief. We also mobilized our teams and supply chain to deliver 250,000 masks and 50,000 isolation gowns to support medical staff. And we are providing 1.5 million units of comfort apparel, hundreds of meals and even Ralph's Coffee for frontline workers across many of our key markets. Next, I want to share some perspective on our experience managing through COVID in mainland China over the past few months. As we prepare to reopen markets around the world, we're applying learnings and strategies from China where the recent recovery gives us confidence that we are making the right decisions now to position our company for long-term, sustainable growth and value creation. We started the quarter with strong, continued momentum in mainland China, our fastest growing market, with sales up more than 35% in January driven by all of our direct-to-consumer channels. By early February, we closed nearly all of our stores in the market due to COVID. We took early strategic actions across marketing and distribution in China, which we have applied in our other markets as the pandemic continued to spread. First, we quickly shifted our marketing to focus on optimistic messages around family, togetherness, and giving, values that have always been an authentic part of who we are. We partnered with celebrities like J. J. Lin, Jim, and Wang Leehom to amplify our messaging. This content resonated well with our consumers across Asia, driving over 124 million video views and a 33% increase in positive brand mentions on social media in Q4 versus Q3. Second, we accelerated our digital and omnichannel capabilities in China in the fourth quarter to better serve our consumers during the store closures and beyond. We were excited to launch digital clienteling, with virtual appointments and customized filing recommendations based on shopper's previous purchases. This program helped to mitigate traffic declines and leverage store inventories while consumers stayed home. We expanded our Buy Online-Ship From Store program to provide greater convenience and limit face-to-face interactions as stores reopen. These initiatives, combined with our digital marketing, drove a 76% increase in China digital sales in the fourth quarter, significantly outperforming the broader apparel industry in February and March. These programs are being tested and rolled out in North America and Europe. And over the coming weeks, we're exploring other contactless options like curbside pickup and self-checkout in many locations. As our China stores reopened in early March, we implemented new safety measures across our stores, offices and distribution centers to protect both our employees and consumers. Store measures include frequent deep cleanings, providing masks for employees and strongly encouraging them for shoppers, and limiting capacity inside our stores to ensure social distancing. While our digital business led the recovery in Mainland China with a return to pre-COVID growth rates in March, we were encouraged by the recovery in our brick-and-mortar stores resulting from these omnichannel and in-store programs. We saw steady improvement in Mainland sales from high-double-digit declines in February at the peak of our closures, ramping back to positive growth in early May. We expect Mainland China to return to pre-COVID growth trends by Q2.  Although we expect the shape and timing of recovery curves to look different in each market, our experience and lessons from China are informing our actions across the rest of Asia, Europe and North America. Despite challenging conditions around the world, I strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more agile, and ultimately take market share. All of this is enabled by the strength of our balance sheet and our brands, coupled with the ingenuity and commitment of our diverse global teams. Turning now to fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results. While COVID-19 was clearly the biggest headwind we faced this year, we were encouraged by our underlying progress on our Next Great Chapter plan prior to the pandemic with our business on track to exceed top and bottom line targets. Our brand elevation work, inclusive of product, marketing, and distribution, came together to deliver positive AUR growth across all three regions for both the quarter and the year. And while the future remains relatively uncertain, we are confident that the key strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan still hold true. Let me touch briefly on a few of these areas. First, in our efforts to win over a new generation, we have created unique and lasting connections with consumers over the first three years of our plan. And we believe that now more than ever is the time to build on this momentum and solidify our iconic brand leadership. Globally, Ralph Lauren brand consideration accelerated through the fourth quarter and into April, outperforming our benchmark peers in each region. Our total social media followers surpassed 43 million in the fourth quarter, a double-digit increase to last year. This was led by very strong increases on TikTok, one of the fastest-growing social media platforms for Gen Z. While we only launched TikTok last summer, we were encouraged that we've already established ourselves as one of the top three luxury brands on the platform. Going forward, as markets reopen, we will continue to focus on the type of values-based messaging that is resonating with consumers across geographies. This work will be underpinned by the targeted personalized marketing that we started earlier this year to drive higher quality of sales. Our brands are defined by values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. We will continue to tap into these authentic values to drive momentum across digital and social channels in fiscal 2021. Second, we continue to energize our core products and accelerate our high-potential, underdeveloped categories this year, led by outerwear and denim. Starting with Ralph's original vision, it has never been just about one category or one item, but rather it's about a lifestyle, which means we can credibly flex across our breadth of products and categories as consumer behaviors change. And with the emergence of COVID, we have seen consumers gravitate towards the simple and true luxuries in life : family, togetherness, the outdoors. Within our assortments, this has translated to stronger sales of comfort categories such as loungewear, athleisure and home. In addition, the competitive advantage of our well-established core is becoming even more evident. Over the course of this year, we had rebalanced our assortments towards core products, which have faster lead times and less markdown risks versus seasonal fashion items that only live for one season. As the industry grapples with excess spring inventory due to COVID, our increased penetration of core gives us more strategic flexibility to work through our inventories and drive AUR growth. With regards to our third key initiative, targeted expansion, we continue to build out our ecosystem approach of a cohesive, brand-elevating Ralph Lauren experience across retail, wholesale and digital commerce around the world in fiscal 2020. Prior to COVID, we opened 25 net new stores and concessions globally. This included 18 net openings in China, our fastest-growing market. While we are carefully evaluating our footprint across direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels in this rapidly evolving environment, we continue to see significant long-term opportunities for our brands in underpenetrated markets, led by China and parts of Europe. Our fourth key initiative is lead with digital. Earlier, I talked about how we accelerated digital and omnichannel initiatives in China this quarter, which are now being implemented in other parts of the world. In addition, we continue to expand our global digital commerce presence across new platforms and partnerships, including our April launch on Instagram Checkout, our first social commerce platform in North America, and we are launching our digital commerce site soon in Japan. We're also making meaningful strides in digitizing how we work, which is an important part of our journey to drive faster lead times, minimize physical waste and reduce costs. In fiscal 2020, we launched our digital library and 3D design studio. This represents a major milestone for our company as it will eventually enable us to digitize our entire end-to-end process from product development all the way to how we communicate with our consumers. We started this process by digitizing all of our Polo core styles, raw materials and trims onto a digital library. Starting in fiscal 2021, we will create 3D prototypes for all of our core Polo products, replacing traditional physical samples. We've already created thousands of 3D prototypes in fiscal 2020, and it's only the beginning, especially as our teams learn to work in new ways from home. And lastly, touching on our initiatives of operating with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline across our organization. This has come into even greater focus in the context of COVID as we drive deeper near-term expense reductions and align our cost structure and inventories through a shifting retail landscape. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of continuing our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business. We started this fiscal year by launching our Design the Change strategy, outlining our commitments to create more sustainable products, reduce our overall environmental footprint across our operations, and support and empower our teams and partners around the world. Some key achievements this year included reaching our gender parity goal of equal representation in our leadership positions at the VP level and above more than three years ahead of our target; the launch of our Earth Polo shirt made entirely from recycled plastic bottles; a new commitment to power all of our globally-owned and operated offices, distribution centers and stores with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. And building upon that, we are now in the process of setting science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which we will detail in this June's annual Design the Change report. In addition, as suppliers around the world struggle with large-scale order cancellations in response to COVID, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay for all finished goods and goods already in production this spring. We are working with our partners to develop new sources of support and long-term job security for factory workers as we look to strengthen our supply chain partnerships not just for the upcoming season, but for years to come. In closing, over the course of more than 50 years, our company has endured many challenging times, and the current crisis will certainly not be the last. Our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style rings as true today as it did when Ralph started this business. And it will continue to guide us in these moments as we make tough decisions in the short term to protect the integrity and health of our brands, so that we emerge from this challenging period in a position of strength. The foundational work that we have done to put the consumer at the center of everything we do, elevate our brands and balance growth and productivity all while maintaining a strong balance sheet, has positioned us well to manage through the current environment. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. This quarter's performance was a study in contrast. We started the spring season with strong continued momentum on our brand elevation journey, with AUR and margins exceeding our expectations as we delivered improved merchandising, expanded digital capabilities and elevated marketing and continued the rollout of targeted pricing increases across channels. This was followed by a very sudden decline in sales as we closed stores across Asia, followed by Europe and North America in accordance with guidelines from government and local health authorities. While our teams remain committed to our long-term strategy centered around brand elevation and targeted expansion, we are focused on managing through the near term so that we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it and pivot quickly back to growth. We started by leveraging some key strengths : a healthy balance sheet, strong liquidity, focused execution, all made possible by our passionate and agile teams. Now more than ever, our strong balance sheet is a source of competitive advantage, giving us resilience and flexibility to continue executing our plan and elevate our brand during challenging times. We ended fiscal 2020 with $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt, which compares to $2 billion in cash and investments and $689 million in debt at the end of last year. Given the uncertain environment created by COVID-19, we announced several measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity. Building on what Patrice shared, these include : First, flexing our costs where possible to align to our top line and carefully managing ongoing expenses and investments to a variable demand outlook. We are currently evaluating what the right operating cost structure and distribution footprint should be across retail and wholesale as we enter a new normal. Second, a reduction in planned capital expenditures to approximately $175 million to $200 million in fiscal 2021. Third, in order to maximize our liquidity, we have temporarily suspended share buybacks. We will also temporarily suspend our dividend following the April payment that was declared in early March. This is a proactive measure to preserve cash, and our Board will revisit this quarterly as we move through the pandemic. And lastly, we drew down $475 million from our revolver in the quarter and are considering additional capital measures to bolster our cash balance. Net inventory at the end of fiscal 2020 was down 10% to last year. The decline largely reflected a significant increase in inventory reserves of about $160 million to keep our inventories aligned with demand and continue our brand elevation as we move forward. Our teams are managing an unprecedented situation, but we are confident that we are taking the right strategic approach to work down excess spring 2020 product while also positioning the company for future growth. Similar to our previous practices, we will also take a targeted approach to clearing excess merchandise. First, with the majority of the traditional spring 2020 selling season lost to COVID closures, our merchants are taking the opportunity to better align our assortments to consumer behavior. As stores reopen, we will extend the season to focus on Wear-Now Styles from June through August in order to maximize full price selling and mitigate markdown risk. This includes shifting some of this season's product to warmer weathers markets. Second, we plan to reassort a portion of our finished products into upcoming seasonal collections, including full price and factory channels. A key benefit of our classic timeless aesthetic is that many of our iconic styles resonate with consumers season-after-season. This merchandise is in pristine condition in our warehouses and has not yet been seen by consumers. While requiring us to hold some inventories longer than usual, this should drive strong AURs and margins once these products are brought to market and enable us to drive our AUR growth trajectory as quickly as possible. Third, we will utilize the full range of our channels to clear product, including targeted markdowns where product is already on selling floors, our factory stores and off-price wholesale. We have also committed to 1.5 million units of product donations to support medical workers across our three regions. We anticipate this process will take longer than a broad strokes end-of-season liquidation. However, our inventory reserve process aligns our inventories to expected demand. This was evident in our reserve actions in the fourth quarter. This process allows our teams to move strategically through inventories while protecting the health of our brands. And lastly, as we look forward, our work to reduce lead times has been a benefit under the current circumstances, enabling our teams to cancel a substantial portion of our shipments for the fall season, about 2/3 of our seasonal buys. Our shorter lead times on core product and fast-track capability launched last holiday will enable us to get quickly back into inventories as demand returns, while limiting our exposure to additional excess inventory risks. Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter revenues declined 15% on a reported basis and 14% in constant currency. Prior to COVID, our business was on track to deliver positive revenue and comp growth for both the quarter and the full year. Our digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated flagship sites, department store dot-com, digital pure plays and social commerce, increased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the full year in constant currency. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe for both periods. Meanwhile, North America improved from flat performance in the first half to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year, as planned, all despite COVID-related disruptions. Adjusted gross margin was 59.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 60.1% last year. Continued improvement in pricing and promotions was more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and unfavorable geographic mix due to lower sales in Asia and Europe. AUR growth of 8% continued to exceed our expectations. SG&A declined 2% to last year on lower selling expenses and marketing and a modest amount of rent relief achieved in the quarter, primarily from Asia. Adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter was $43 million compared to operating income of $96 million last year. Marketing declined 8% in constant currency as we shifted the timing of investments back into the Q3 holiday period and reduced performance marketing while stores were closed. For the full year, marketing growth of 3% continued to outpace our top line growth as we work to win over a new generation of consumers. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 11% to last year. Retail comps declined 13%, driven by a 15% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps and a 7% decline in our own digital comps. Brick-and-mortar comps were impacted by significant traffic declines as foreign tourist traffic slowed and we closed all stores in March. Prior to the outbreak, however, the full price and factory comps were trending up mid- to high single digits in January and February, driven by AUR growth and improved product assortments. AUR for the quarter was up low double digits across our brick-and-mortar fleet, driven by our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases, reduced promotional cadence and stronger product mix. Comps in our North America directly-operated digital commerce business were down 7%. Traffic and conversion were negatively impacted by two proactive decisions on our part. First, with the onset of COVID in March, we suspended all promotional activity and performance-driven marketing to our site as our employees and consumers focused on their safety and well-being. Second, we temporarily closed our U.S. distribution center in late March for deep cleaning and new safety protocols. While our site was still technically operational, delayed order fulfillment negatively impacted our conversion rates. As we resumed our marketing activities and limited DC operations in April, we saw a meaningful improvement in both digital traffic and comps. In North America wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 12%. Prior to store closures in mid-March, our sell-out performance was improving slightly on a year-over-year basis to down mid-single digits, driven by rebalanced assortments and improved product offering. The additional declines were driven by order cancellations in the last few weeks of March as our customers closed stores due to COVID. Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue declined 19% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency. Europe retail comps declined 16%, driven by an 18% decrease in our brick-and-mortar stores and a 2% decrease in our owned digital commerce sites. Across our Europe direct-to-consumer channels, our ongoing effort to elevate the brand and improve product mix continued in the fourth quarter, with AUR up 10%. This is consistent with our long-term strategy to drive higher quality of sales and price harmonization in the marketplace. Digital commerce comps on our own site were pressured by a temporary closure of our distribution center and a pause on product-driven marketing due to COVID, similar to North America. Total digital ecosystem sales grew double digits in constant currency, driven by performance in both wholesale.com and digital pure plays. Europe wholesale revenue declined 18% in constant currency, driven by COVID-related pressures at bricks-and-mortar stores. These declines were partially offset by strong double-digit growth in our digital pure play and wholesale.com businesses. Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 22% on a reported basis and 21% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. AUR increased high single digits as our product and marketing initiatives continue to resonate well in the region. While performance varied by market, we saw the biggest percentage declines in Mainland China, the epicenter of the pandemic, where the majority of our stores were closed for about five weeks. Brick-and-mortar sales trends improved sequentially from trough levels in February turning positive in early May. Despite significant challenges from store closures across Asia, we were encouraged by continued momentum in our digital businesses in the quarter, with our digital ecosystem up high teens driven by strong momentum in China and Korea. Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain, first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. Due to the high level of uncertainty and the evolving situation surrounding COVID-19, we are suspending future guidance. We expect our financial results for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021 to be significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic. In the near term, we are focused on positioning the company to get back to sustainable growth and value creation as quickly as possible. This includes preserving balance sheet strength, aligning our cost base in inventories to the new normal and optimizing our distribution, all while protecting the health of our brands. Though the timing and path of recovery in each market presents many uncertainties, we have developed scenarios through which we plan to safely return our businesses to growth. As Patrice outlined, China was our first market to emerge from business closures, laying out a path to normalization, and we will leverage many of these key learnings as we reopen around the world. In closing, we are proud of the focus, agility and passion our teams have demonstrated through personally and professionally challenging times. We believe the Ralph Lauren brand has momentum. We have the right strategic priorities and the discipline to manage through this period and emerge in a position of strength. Now as ever, we are proud to have an iconic brand and to be led by Ralph's creative vision. This has endured the test of time. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning everyone. Hope everyone is safe and healthy. Jane Nielsen : Good morning Dana. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Dana. Dana Telsey : Good morning. One for Patrice and one for Jane. Patrice, as you think about, how are you adapting your Next Great Chapter strategy to the new global retail environment and the changing behavior coming out of COVID? And then one for Jane. Can you please help me put together the first quarter into context for us or provide any assistance with the cadence on the rest of the year? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Great. Dana, thank you for your question. So let me start by saying that, fortunately, we actually entered this crisis in a position of strength and with momentum, right? We have a solid balance sheet and cash position. We've been expanding our direct-to-consumer and digital presence. We've created a more flexible and diversified global supply chain. And we have a brand that credibly flexes across categories, underpinned by values that are really resonating in this moment. Think timelessness, optimism, togetherness, trust. We've also done a lot prior to the crisis to build agility and resilience in our teams, and this is obviously now more relevant than ever. So given the solid foundation, we believe we ultimately have an opportunity to gain market share as we emerge from this crisis. With respect to our Next Great Chapter strategy, the strategic pillars of our plan completely hold true today in the current environment, but there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities. Let me give you three examples. There are many more, but the three I would highlight are : first, continuing to accelerate digital, right? We transformed our digital selling platforms over the last three years, new e-commerce platform, new OMS system, mobile personalization and connected retail streams. So we have a strong infrastructure in place when it comes to digital commerce and connected retail. We're fast tracking and scaling new digital capabilities like digital clienteling and other forms of virtual selling. And we're encouraged by our progress and early reads so far, including understanding what we've done in China recently. The second thing I'd call out is assessing our store footprint. So we still believe in the role of the store, and we're encouraged by the early connected retail interventions like curbside pickup, for example, but we're going to continue to review our store portfolio in the context of our omnichannel strategy. And especially within North America wholesale, this means continuing to concentrate on our most productive brick-and-mortar doors, which are generally the top doors of our wholesale partners anyhow, as we also grow select wholesale.com opportunities. And the third example I would call out, Dana, is around scaling new ways of working for us. And we've been able to do things in weeks and days that typically would have taken us months or years to do. This includes our ability to work remotely around the world, continuing to digitize our end-to-end value chain and also driving a culture of cost discipline, which is obviously critical in the current environment that we're in. So the strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan still hold true in this environment. We are feeling actually quite good about that, but there's a clear opportunity to accelerate some of the priorities, some of which I just called out for you. And then I think, Jane, you will cover the Q1 question. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Dana, we're not giving guidance for Q1, but let me just give you some color and shape about how we're thinking about it. We expect right now that Q1 will be the quarter with the most significant impact from COVID as we see it now. On an order-of-magnitude basis, consider Q1 in contrast to Q4. In Q4, we had two weeks of closures approximately versus about eight to ten weeks of closures in Q1. And even after opening stores, we've seen a gradual and elongated recovery period. As you look across every region, we expect the impact of COVID to be most pronounced in Q1. I think that's probably very clear for North America and Europe, where we were closed almost the entirety of April and May, with stores just starting to come back online. Today, a little less than 50% of North America stores are now open. And in Europe, which is a bit further ahead, about two thirds of the stores are now open, but all with \u2013 operating with reduced hours, reduced traffic and with new social distancing requirements. Compared to our experience in Mainland China and Korea, we do expect a more prolonged recovery with improvement over time. And obviously, this is going to vary by market. In Asia, which was ahead of the curve and where we're 90% open, we still will see the biggest impact in Q1 where markets like Japan, Southeast Asia and Australia and even parts of China saw large COVID impacts in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the way that the digital sales are leading as infrastructure opens, and our teams are very clear that opening stores is the first step to getting back to comp growth. So we're all focused on that and prioritizing that. And just as you think about expenses in FY2021 from a cadence standpoint, from a cost perspective, as you saw in our 8-K, we took substantial actions as we closed out the fourth quarter. We furloughed about 80% of our workforce in April, and this will continue through June. And as we begin to ramp back up, employees and infrastructure to support sales in late June, and we'll stage \u2013 we'll stage that with \u2013 as demand stabilizes. But our largest SG&A reductions will be in Q1 and a little bit over 25%, and then it will moderate for \u2013 the reductions will moderate there as demand stabilizes. So a little bit of color on the quarter and our expectations in what we're seeing in the market for the year. Dana Telsey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Jane Nielsen : Hi Matt. Jane Nielsen : May be we\u2019ll go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Jane Nielsen : Good morning Heather. Heather Balsky : Good morning. In terms of my question, there's a lot now regarding the wholesale channel and how you're partnering and responding both right now. And as you look to the back half of this year and into 2021, calendar 2021, can you just talk about how you see that channel potentially ramping in terms of the recovery and what you can do to manage through the additional uncertainty in terms of them closing stores and tightly managing inventory? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So as I step back and we look at kind of our long-term plan and strategy, we expect the bulk of our growth to come from direct-to-consumer and wholesale.com. As far as brick-and-mortar wholesale is concerned, our focus is really on making sure, as it has been over the past couple of years actually, that we are in the right locations in a way that is brand-enhancing and financially attractive, right? So this will likely mean that as we work through the year with our partners, we will be calling some of the smaller doors, working with them. Importantly, for all of you on the call, these recent bankruptcies from JCPenney's and Neiman Marcus actually don't impact us. Our business is nonexistent at JCPenney's and relatively small at Neiman Marcus. But I'd say, Heather, our emphasis is really, when it comes to the wholesale space, wholesale.com, which has got nice momentum, and we're building capabilities with our partners and then making sure that we have the right footprint going forward in that space. Jane Nielsen : And what we've seen is that as we closed out in March together in partnership with our wholesale partners, we stopped a number of shipments to make sure that our inventory levels remained in good balance, knowing that they would face closures as we did. So we feel good about where our inventories are. We are planning conservatively as we move into the hot fall season. But the good news is as demand develops, because of our case capabilities and our ability to refill from core, we feel we have the flexibility to meet demand with our wholesale partners as it evolves without needing \u2013 without \u2013 while managing inventories tightly and maintaining a good full price selling environment. Heather Balsky : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. Will try this again. Patrice Louvet : It works. Good morning, Matt. Matthew Boss : Patrice, maybe as we think about and measure the strength of the Ralph brand as you see it today, what are you seeing in April and May e-commerce trends as we think about the U.S. and Europe? Jane, I think you talked about a meaningful improvement. Have you seen trends return to positive territory? And then with more than half of your stores now reopened, what kind of initial productivity are you seeing at brick-and-mortar so far to start back in the reopening process? Patrice Louvet : Good. So I guess starting at high level on brand perception. We've actually been really encouraged by how our performance on consideration has increased during this crisis. So quantitative measures, both in Asia, Europe and North America, where across all three regions we've seen brand consideration scores go up over the past few weeks. We attribute that to all the work that we've done on values communication and also all the philanthropic work that we've done across the region. So feeling that we've got good tailwinds there. As far as e-commerce is concerned, we \u2013 let me start east first. I guess, we're feeling very good about the performance in China. I think you heard us say February, March, up 76% while the overall sector was down, so we were gaining share in that environment. We can give you some color on the specific weeks for March and April, which Jane will give you. But I think overall, with all the new capabilities that we've put in place, whether that's digital clienteling, whether that's all the connected retail capabilities, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on dot-com. And I was joking with the team last week that actually, at this point, given the stores are not fully opened yet, we are, to some extent, a digital pure player because that's our biggest business today. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Matt, let me give you some color on what we've seen on a quarter-to-date basis across the regions. APAC, as we said, we closed out Q4 very strong across Asia on our e-commerce business, and that has only built. So April and into May, we've seen very strong and positive e-commerce trends closing out in the \u2013 sometimes, we've seen rates of triple-digit growth in APAC, so very strong. In Europe, while we did see some \u2013 we reported down 3% on our own platform in Q4. As we've come out and especially as we closed out April, and I think people saw the end of the crisis, we've been seeing very strong trends across Europe. So we've had double \u2013 solid double-digit growth in Europe on a very high quality of sales number where we're seeing double-digit growth in AUR on our e-commerce site in Europe. So strong quality of sales and strong momentum. North America, which is probably the furthest behind in regions in terms of store openings terms of store openings and recovery, we reported down 7% in the fourth quarter. And it's really been in May that we've started to see e-commerce back to solid and double-digit growth, but it's been building on a week-over-week basis, so encouraging there. So we do see, as our stores open, digital leads and it starts to build over time. As we've gotten \u2013 we're sort of in the early days, if you will, in terms of store opening productivity, 50% open in North America and really very early on that journey, two-thirds open in Europe. Still early days on that journey which makes our experience anecdotal. I can tell you, in China, as stores reopened, traffic remained weak in the initial weeks but with strong conversion. So buyers who are coming to the store were motivated and ADTs, average daily transactions, average value transactions were up strongly. Conversion was up strongly and AUR has continued to be up strongly. I can give you some \u2013 we're not \u2013 it's early days, but I can tell you, as we think about our trajectory in \u2013 overall in Asia, that it will be different in North America. But coming out of January, we saw \u2013 if I think about the Asia, we were up strongly in January, up 40%. February saw the biggest declines, down well over 80%. March, we started to recover, digital sales started to come back. In April, sales were down high single digits. And so far in May, we're really encouraged by the improvements. Everything was turning positive in early May as Beijing and other larger cities' restrictions lifted, and we expect to be strongly back to growth in Q2 of this year in Mainland China. So encouraged by that trajectory. Don't expect to be a cookie-cutter approach across the regions, but that's what we've seen so far. Matthew Boss : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Best of luck. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Matt. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Sussie. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys Thanks for all the details. I want to ask you two things. I guess, first on the inventory and the write-off and the decision to exclude some of that from the gross margin line in the quarter. I think that's a little different than how we've seen some others in the sector treating it. So maybe a little bit on how you got to the $160 million number. How did that inventory get treated on the P&L as you sell-through it? And maybe just a little bit of help on how to think about what we're going to see as you move through that in the first quarter. And then separately, on the AUR, I guess, a longer-term question, but this has been the real engine behind your revenue and gross profit dollar growth for several years. You've mentioned it a lot of times today. Now the apparel world is about to go on a huge sale, given what we've heard around the space. I have no doubt you'll tell me the AUR story continues to be critical to the long term. But maybe you could just help us think about what adjustments you need to think about in the near term given the state of inventory in the channel, the level of markdowns that seem like they're coming across the space, the store closures we know about in the brick-and-mortar world, et cetera. Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Sure. That's a power-packed question, so let me take it one layer at a time. Let me step back and tell you why we decided to report both our NRV reserve and our bad debt as a non-GAAP item. We believe that it is entirely related to the experience of COVID, where we lost a selling season. So it's not a business as usual NRV reserve. It was significant. The process that we went through as a team was we took stock of all of our inventory flows, our commitments at suppliers on a fabric basis, and then went back to our strategy and said, what can we reasonably move through to continue our quality of sales journey with our own liquidation channels, with stretching the seasons while moving into warmer-weather channels and reassorting the line in coming seasons? And then what do we remain with? And how do we reserve appropriately to protect the AUR and gross margin progress that we've done to date. So we really looked at it, a complete life cycle view. That's not a different process. We've been doing that process for well over two years. The magnitude and the onetime impact was greater. So we \u2013 that's why we reflected it. If our NRV reserve is too small or too great, we will take that on what we reserved, we will take that also on a non-GAAP basis below the line, so that you and our investors can track our true progress on gross margin as we move through this COVID environment. So that's our rationale. We'll take \u2013 if there is better selling, then you'll see an adjustment on a non-GAAP item in NRV. As a good vendor, I want to remind you that we know that we have made a commitment to pay for products that were perhaps cut but we did not have ownership of in Q1. There will be some reflection of that in Q1. The magnitude we'll disclose in Q1. As I look at overall the \u2013 your question on the AUR story, you're exactly right. You know me well. We are continuing this AUR journey. And that is \u2013 and that was really behind some of the actions you saw us take in the fourth quarter. We're committed to it. And so we took an inventory reserve that protects that. I think the good news is that the long-term drivers of AUR growth are still intact. We're elevating our product, we're elevating our marketing, and we're elevating our shopping experience. We have shown that we can take strategic price increases and have a positive consumer reaction. That \u2013 Q3, we posted 8% AUR. Q4, we were able to maintain 8% AUR. I'm not guiding, but I expect that our AUR journey that's consistent with our long-term guidance in FY 2021, low-single-digit to mid-single-digit will continue through this year. Will it be more variable? Perhaps, but we have a clear idea of what we need to do to move through our inventory positions. Part of that will be that we are keeping inventory in our warehouses to reassort it into the line that our designers are working on right now. So that we have a cohesive line in spring and get full price sell through on some of that product. And we're really having success in targeting promotions more effectively and more efficiently. We've been able to reduce promotion days. And this personalization is proving highly effective as a lever to drive AUR. North America in the fourth quarter had AURs up 10%, so really significant and positive growth there. So we have every intent to continue that journey. So we are excited about that, know that there's some variability, but we feel our actions in the fourth quarter and our plans for this year are completely consistent with our continued AUR journey. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow : Hey, good morning, Patrice, Jane, Cory. Glad, you're all doing well. Jane Nielsen : Thanks, Ike. Patrice Louvet : Hi. Ike Boruchow : I guess just two from me. So you gave a lot of helpful color, Jane, on the U.S. reopening \u2013 I think \u2013 just maybe more enclosed mall. I don't know if you have enough of a sample size, but I'm kind of curious if you have differing results on reopening volume there. And then you talked about off price exposure, kind of coming up a little bit. You guys have spoken about bringing that down for the past couple of years. Does the new world we're in right now kind of change your thought process on that? Do you kind of need to go back to the off-price channel in a bigger way because of what's going on in the wholesale channel in the U.S.? Would love your thoughts there as well. Patrice Louvet : Good. So let's start with your first question on open-air malls versus kind of closed malls. Yes, we have seen a difference between open-air malls and closed mall. Open-air malls, obviously, rebounding faster. And to \u2013 just to give you a sense of the split of our business with kind of open-air malls and open-air stores versus closed in North America and in Europe, the vast majority of our stores are actually an open-air environment, I think 85% to 90%. So I think from that standpoint, we're actually well positioned as consumers are more comfortable shopping in that space. And then over time, they'll become more comfortable with the closed space, but the vast majority of our business is in open-air. And then in off price, Jane, over to you. Jane Nielsen : Yes. So I got you. In this quarter, our off-price sales were down on a year-over-year basis. And so that's a combination of working with our partners and we had some excess liquidation. But as I move into next year, we see that that channel will continue to be an opportunity for excess liquidation and it will not be a part of our growth trajectory. I expect it to decline this year on a year-over-year basis. And we worked through \u2013 how we're going to work through the inventory by leaning into what we talked about in terms of reassorting the line, extending wear-now season, charitable donations and of course liquidating some excess through, off price, but I don't expect it to be a growth area of our business. Next question, please. Ike Boruchow : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Thanks so much. I have two questions. One, Patrice, you mentioned at the top of the call, you're focused on denim this year. A lot of people have been talking about categories like denim maybe \u2013 have been a little bit less popular with consumers focusing on, things to wear at home or things to exercise in. And so can you maybe just tell us a little bit more about how you think this pandemic will change consumers\u2019 outlook on denim? And then secondly, given that a lot of talk about the wholesale channel and maybe some store closures out there, how do you feel about your full-price store model in the U.S.? I think instead of rolling out more full-price stores, do you feel comfortable that you have a plan to do that if you need to at this point? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure. Good morning, Jay. So let's start with the product categories. We are tracking very closely kind of consumer interest across different categories. And you're right that we've seen an acceleration in loungewear, an acceleration in athleisure, we've also seen an acceleration in the home business. The good news with our brand is we're a lifestyle brand, right? So we're not focused only on one category. We actually have a broad range of offerings. And I think we're credible across a broad range of categories. So we will \u2013 we have actually started to pivot. If you go on our website, you will see that we've pivoted to a more emphasis on loungewear and athleisure. I don't think we're going to move away from the focus on denim because we expect over the mid to long-term that that continues to be a growth category. But I talked a lot about agility earlier and that's critical for us as we think about consumer behavior. And that's both true in how we engage with consumers in terms of messaging, but also where we put the emphasis from a category standpoint. Jane Nielsen : Yeah, Jay, we continue to believe that we have a significant opportunity to build stores for FY 2021. We're expecting to open approximately 90 to a 100 stores. We are very happy with our model in Asia and we've been working on penetration in Europe and we're still working on the North America model. We do believe that there's an opportunity but we know that the role of the store is changing. And so we're evaluating our footprint with \u2013 to reflect these consumer changes. But we do think that there's an opportunity for us to pivot to DTC, and it remains an important part of our strategy. Next question please? Jay Sole : Got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Good morning, Patrice and Jane. Thanks for taking my question. Patrice Louvet : Good morning. John. Jane Nielsen : Good morning. John. John Kernan : Nice job, managing through a difficult environment. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Thank you. John Kernan : I wanted to take your thoughts on how we should think about the wholesale channel in North America with some of your full-price partners and how they're planning the back half of the calendar year. We've heard orders down in excess of 30%, 40%. Just wondering if the environment ends up being better than what some people have planned to date. Can people chase into that and can you see better trends than maybe some of the numbers we're hearing from the wholesale community to-date? Jane Nielsen : So with our wholesale partners, we are planning conservatively with them and aligned to what they've indicated in terms of their fall holiday demand. So I think that we are focused on our AUR journey, focus on keeping our inventories well controlled and healthy. So we're planning conservatively, but consistent with our wholesale partners planning. As they move forward, we still see digital as an opportunity for growth there. And we're pursuing that. We were able to cancel about two-thirds of our fall holiday orders, take stock of where we were on an inventory level and then fill in to make sure that we have fulsome assortments for fall holidays that are better aligned to demand. So we've been working on this as we saw the crisis emerge, but we're fully aligned with where our wholesale partners are indicating and conservatively plan. Patrice Louvet : And I think on your question, John, relative to our ability to chase, which we spent a lot of time on. So we feel that we're in a good place. We've done a lot of work to increase the responsiveness of our supply chain. We have the digitization that I referred to earlier, has obviously been a key enabler to that. The other thing that I think really separates us from many of our peers is core is such an important part of our business, right? And we are known for the number of core iconic SKUs. Now the good news is the core SKUs are the easier and faster SKUs to chase into, right? And we've also platformed fabrics. The team has done a wonderful job platforming the fabrics and various trims and others. So we have the ability on core to go fast. And then finally, and I don't know if you remember when I referred to this, I think it was like two or three quarters ago. We've developed a fast, what we've called the fast track capability internally. I think I gave you the example of this sweatshirt that we had developed with one of our wholesale partners from idea to shipment, 16 days, right, coming from Asia. And I think at Ralph Lauren, sometimes we're known for more longer lead times and days. Sometimes we've been talked about months rather than days. This capability we've scaled up since we developed it. So this fast track capability is \u2013 will be a fantastic platform for us to react to what we see in the market as we work with our wholesale partners. John Kernan : That\u2019s helpful. Patrice Louvet : All right. Well listen, thanks to all of you for joining our call today. On behalf of all of us here at Ralph Lauren, we wish you and your families, the best of health and safety, take good care. And we'll talk to you in a few months, have a great day. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please, go ahead. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's first quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release, and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations' website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. The past few months have marked a period of extraordinary challenge, but also resilience, agility and hope. Our financial performance this quarter reflects an unprecedented three months of COVID-19 related impact around the world. We're taking the opportunity to leverage this period of disruption to accelerate our core strategic focus areas, drive new areas of growth and we aligned our resources accordingly. Building on the strong foundational work our teams had done prior to COVID, over the past few months, they have executed with incredible agility and speed to strengthen our connected retail capabilities, further rationalize our North America brick and mortar wholesale presence, and continue to build our brand through personalized consumer engagement and more values based messaging, all while pursuing our brand elevation journey as evidenced by our strong AUR in gross margin progress. Since, Ralph started our company more than 50 years ago, his focus on the long-term and the spirit of timelessness has enabled us to not only survive times of uncertainty, but drive lasting authentic connections with our consumers. To that end, we have a responsibility that goes well beyond the products we sell. And I first want to take a moment to address the persistent, systemic racial injustice in the U.S. and around the world. We've been listening to our teams and a few of the many actions we've taken over the past couple of months include : one, we committed to elevate more black and African American talent into our leadership ranks. We will interview two underrepresented candidates for every open leadership role, and we are committing to ensure that people of color represent at least 20% of our global leadership team by 2023. We are examining how we portray the American dream in the stories we tell, the creators we champion and the faces we elevate, and we've also undertaken a review of our marketing and media partners to ensure that these channels operate in a way that aligns with our values. And three, we are instituting a set of diversity expectations for our partners and vendors to hold our network accountable as well. This is only the beginning, and on behalf of our entire leadership team, Ralph and I want to be clear, to our black and African American colleagues and people of color, both in our Company and in our communities, we hear you, we stand with you, and we commit to do better by you. Moving to COVID. We experienced our first full quarter of impact from the pandemic in Q1, with widespread store closures across all three regions. In this difficult environment, our teams launched several new digital initiatives, accelerated new customer acquisition, and delivered compelling engagement in product categories that resonate with consumers today all while meaningfully reducing our expenses. As I've said before, our objective is to emerge from this period stronger than we came into it. We are constantly learning and taking action to ensure we not only endure through this crisis, but are positioned to thrive long-term. I'll start with an update on our path to recovery in each region. Following our store closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, our doors were closed an additional 8 to 10 weeks across many of our largest markets in Q1. This drove a 57% comp decline in the first quarter, slightly better than our expectations. By region the largest declines were in North America and Europe, where stores were closed the longest on average, with brick and mortar comps down more than 70% in each region. Asia comps were down 33%. Earlier recovery in Korea and Mainland China was more than offset by closures in Japan, our largest market in Asia, where the government drove shutdowns in early April. By channel, the path to recovery in each region has been led by our digital businesses where we resumed targeted consumer marketing and accelerated our online capabilities while stores were closed. Owned digital comps were positive in all regions this quarter, led by 68% growth in Asia, and 44% growth in Europe. North America also returned to positive digital comps. Global momentum in our digital channels was followed by our store re-openings across geographies. As of today, we are pleased to report that nearly all of our stores were opened in Asia, Europe and North America. But we are watching resurgences closely, and our priority remains the health and safety of our teams, and our consumers. As stores reopened, we experienced significant traffic and comp declines initially, with strong growth in conversion rates and average basket size. In the weeks that followed, we saw sequential improvement in brick and mortar traffic and comps, although both metrics were still negative as we exited the quarter. Our Europe and North America comp declines in June were roughly half the rate we experienced in April. And Asia comps improved from more than 50% declines in April to a single-digit decline in June. While we remain cautious on the pace of recovery, as CVOID continues to develop around the world, we are encouraged by our progress this quarter on our long-term journey of brand elevation, enabled by our inventory discipline pre-COVID, and early actions taken since the start of the pandemic, we generated double-digit AUR growth and significantly lower discount rates in our own retail channels in Q1. We also drove lower markdown allowances at wholesale, which brings me to our wholesale performance through COVID. We have experienced a similar trajectory to our own stores, with our wholesale brick and mortar partners close for a comparable period in the quarter. On a sell-out basis, we've seen encouraging sequential improvement, led again by strong growth in digital. At brick and mortar wholesale, our sell-out declines have moderated on a month-by-month basis, though we're still down double-digits in June. As we noted on our last call, we're taking a number of key actions to ensure that this channel is well positioned as we emerge from the crisis. First, on a sell-in basis, we stopped shipping spring-summer products to nearly all wholesale accounts in March. This enabled our partners to continue selling through products received prior to closures, while preventing the buildup of excess inventories in the channel. Second, we also proactively reduced our fall holiday orders by two-thirds at the start of COVID in order to reintegrate existing product into upcoming collections. While we continue to diligently manage our inventories through the pandemic, we've selectively filled in key programs to ensure appropriate seasonal assortments. And as of June, we resume shipping a very limited quantities of replenishment product, and are working with our partners to take a carefully monitored approach to fall holiday. While these reductions are driving significant declines in our first half selling to wholesale, they are a critical step to realign our inventories to expected demand and continue enabling our strategy of brand elevation. And third, we're utilizing this period to accelerate shifts in our wholesale distribution, particularly in North America brick and mortar. Working with our partners, we exited more than 200 lower performing wholesale doors this spring in order to focus on our most productive locations. While these closures represent less than 5% of our sales to the channel, we are working to not only recapture these sales, but also grow share in our remaining businesses. This is a two-pronged approach, focus on increasing productivity in the brick and mortar doors we are moving forward with, and deliberately shifting sales towards digital. To this end, we are activating highly targeted marketing in the relevant wholesale consumers, a program we successfully tested prior to COVID. That takes us to my next update, leading with digital. Through the pandemic, we have accelerated the rollout of connected retail programs and leveraged high impact digital marketing as we shift toward a true omni-channel model. New connected retail capabilities in the quarter included finding store, virtual selling appointment, live stream selling, digital catalogs, and expanded Buy Online Ship from Store. Consumer response to these initiatives has been encouraging so far. In North America factory stores, for example, virtual appointments have driven double the spend versus our average consumer transaction. We also continue to rollout targeted, personalized consumer engagement, including tailored marketing and promotional offers. This will enable us to drive more effective marketing along with a lower level of overall promotions and better product recommendations over time. While I'm energized by the successful rollouts in the midst of COVID, there remains a lot of opportunity to deepen and expand our digital connectivity and omni-channel capabilities. We will also continue to digitize how we work. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms, which we successfully rolled out from men's Purple Label last month, and continuing to expand our digital product creation. Turning now to our marketing and brand elevation journey through COVID. Since the start of our next great chapter plan in fiscal '19, we've added an average of more than 5 million new consumers per year to our brands through our direct-to-consumer channels alone. This is consistent with our plan to win over a new generation, and we believe we have an opportunity to take share in this environment. In the first quarter, we resumed marketing activities. These included targeted email campaigns with predictive AI, and high-reach paid social media aimed at acquiring new consumers, driving traffic and conversion to our channels. And through our campaigns like RL-at-home and Pride, we continue to tap into our authentic values like optimism, quality and togetherness, which are especially relevant in the current context. These initiatives have resonated well with consumers. Globally, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic, and our total social media followers reached nearly 44 million in the first quarter, a 9% increase to last year led by double-digit growth on Instagram and Tik-Tok. Critically, we have also continued our work to both elevate and protect the health and integrity of our brand through the current crisis, consistent with our long-term strategy. These actions include : one, reducing our total penetration in off-price and bottom wholesale brick and mortar doors, while driving faster growth in our direct-to-consumer and wholesale.com businesses. Two, bring discipline in inventories to reduce the need for discounting and heavy promotions. And three, we continued improving our product offering, and resetting our price value proposition across each channel in the marketplace. We were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts, reductions in promotional activity, and strategic price increases. Moving onto our initiatives to operate with discipline to fuel growth. A key element of our long-term plan has been to balance growth with productivity, which includes driving a culture of cost discipline and working in new ways across our organization. Since the start of the pandemic, we have made hard choices to reduce near-term expenses so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it, and pivot quickly back to growth. We're also in the process of reassessing our long-term operating structure to align our resourcing and investments to our strategic priorities, and a shifting retail landscape, while also building more flexibility into our cost structure. Jane will discuss this in more detail in a moment. And lastly, I want to highlight the continued importance of our journey to integrate citizenship and sustainability across our business. We were proud that parity.org recently named us among the best companies for women to advance. And I hope you've all had a chance to check out our annual Design the Change report published this June. The report delineates clear target dates around our commitments, new science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, and our new commitments to reducing water consumption across our value chain in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund. In closing, Ralph and I, are proud of and grateful for the dedication, commitment and agility our teams are demonstrating as we navigate through highly challenging conditions around the world. I've said this before, but I still strongly believe this crisis is creating opportunities for our business to emerge leaner, more nimble and, ultimately, take market share. We are using this time to proactively deliver the products, channels and authentic brand connections that consumers crave in this rapidly evolving environment. And while the effects of the pandemic appear to be far from over, we have strong foundations in place to manage through the continued uncertainty, including remote and flexible working, new connected retailing capabilities, a strong digital marketing proposition, and a clear inventory management strategy. And we are privileged to have one of the greatest assets of all, the strength of our timeless global brand, which we will steadfastly protect and build through this period and beyond. And before I hand it off to Jane, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Darren Walker, who joined our Board of Directors last week. Currently the President and CEO of the Ford Foundation, we believe Darren's experience and philanthropy, and business will not only complement our Board's existing expertise, but will bring important new perspective. I'd also like to thank departing directors Joyce Brown and Robert Wright for their leadership and valued contributions to the Company over many years. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, to discuss our financial results. And I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. This quarter was undoubtedly one of the most challenging periods in our Company's history. All of our reportable regions and physical channels faced retail closures and consumer self-distancing on a mass scale. As we started reopening stores with new safety protocols, reduced hours and capacity restrictions, consumers remained cautious, as expected, but we were encouraged by the sequential improvements across each region. During the quarter, we continued to leverage our key strengths, starting with our balance sheet, which is a real competitive advantage through this crisis, and gives us the flexibility to continue to execute our plan and elevate our brand. We ended the first quarter with $2.7 billion in Cash and Investments, and $1.9 billion in total debt, which compared to $2 billion in Cash and Investments, and $692 million in debt at the end of last year's first quarter. Building on our actions in Q4, we took additional precautionary measures to preserve cash and strengthen liquidity in the first quarter. These actions included, first, the issuance of $1.25 billion in debt in June with proceeds going towards the pay down of our revolver August 2020 notes, and the remainder held for general corporate purposes as we continue to manage through COVID. Second, we continue to reduce our cost to align to our top line and better align with our long-term strategy, with first quarter SG&A down 30% to last year. Third, we reduced our wholesale footprint by more than 200 doors this quarter and we'll continue evaluating our presence as we move forward. We also worked closely with our wholesale partners to reduce our outstanding receivables by more than half since the start of the crisis. In addition, we have improved our working capital and cash conversion cycle from the start of the crisis through a combination of lower accounts receivable and extended days payable, despite the challenging global retail conditions. Second, we are aligning our resources to support future growth and profitability as we accelerate our core strategic focus areas. As a part of this, we are in the process of determining the right organizational and operating structures to support this growth. Our work will focus on six key areas : team organizational structures and capabilities, enterprise-wide processes and new ways of working, our distribution center and corporate office footprint, our own DTC and wholesale door presence as we assess the role of each store within the ecosystem, all discretionary expenses such as travel and sample costs, and lastly, our brand portfolio. These plans are beginning to take shape, informed by both our growth objectives and the constantly evolving consumer context, and we will share more with you in the coming months. Net inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 22% to last year with double-digit declines across all regions. Our strong AUR and gross margin performance this quarter gives us confidence that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess spring '20 product, while also positioning the company for future growth. Moving on to our first quarter performance. First quarter revenues declined 66% on a reported basis and 65% in constant currency. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 57% as Patrice mentioned, driven by COVID related store closures across all regions and gradual recovery rates as doors reopened. The brick and mortar comp decline was partially offset by a 13% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. And more importantly, we accelerated digital profitability with Q1 digital operating margins expanding more than a 1,000 basis points in all three regions through a combination of higher-quality sales and SG&A leverage. With digital representing our fastest growing channel in the company driving profitability in this business is not only critical to our long-term margin accretion, but also for our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Adjusted gross margin was 71.8% in the first quarter compared to 64.5% last year. Approximately one-third of this expansion was driven by our continued improvement in pricing and promotions while about two-third was driven by unusual geographic and channel mix shifts due to COVID. The COVID factors were, first, we reported significantly better topline results in Asia this quarter compared to Europe and North America, which were largely closed during the period. In addition to being the earliest region on the path to recovery from COVID related impacts, Asia is also our highest gross margin and AUR market across the three geographies. Second, our gross margin mix benefited from a lower contribution from factory stores and off-price due to physical store closures, combined with a higher relative contribution from full price digital commerce in the period. We expect these mix distortions to moderate significantly beyond Q1 as our other regions and factory stores have gradually returned to operations. However, we still expect to expand gross margins going forward with improved pricing and promotion continuing to be the most durable driver, along with a more normalized level of geographic and channel mix benefit. First quarter AUR growth of 25% exceeded our expectations in a promotional competitive environment, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID related mix impacts just noted, underlying AUR still grew high single-digits to last year. This is consistent with our recent trajectory and above the low to mid single-digit growth we guided for fiscal '21, as we continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduce promotional depth and breadth and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America. SG&A expenses declined 30% to last year on savings from employee furloughs and store rents, as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating loss for the first quarter was $174 million compared to operating income of $175 million last year. Marketing declined 34% as we shifted some activities later in the year. We also pivoted investment from in-store and event based engagements toward longer-term brand building activities focused on digital and our values based messaging. We still anticipate that SG&A declines were moderate as we move through the year as we bring an appropriate level of infrastructure and staffing back to support reopened businesses. Moving onto segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 77% to last year. Retail comps declined 64%, driven by a 77% decline in bricks and mortar comps, while our own digital comps increased 3%. Brick and mortar comps were primarily impacted by store closures for a majority of the quarter across the region, and an absence of foreign tourist traffic in the quarter. In addition, as stores have reopened, we have seen moderate sequential improvement as reduced mall opening hours and restrictions on customer capacity further impact performance. Beyond Q1, we continue to plan cautiously given a high level of uncertainty around broader macro-trends as well as evolving consumer behavior. AUR for the quarter was up double digits in both our full-price and factory stores, driven by reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticketing price increases. Comps in our North America directly operated digital commerce business grew 3% compared to 7% decline in the fourth quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to high-teens growth in the quarter, while sales to international and [Diego] customers declined double digits to last year, as planned. Growth in our domestic traffic and comps improved as we turned performance-driven marketing back on in mid-April, following an initial quiet period due to COVID. Our digital marketing work generated a 65% increase in high-quality new consumers this quarter, driving our full price sales penetration higher. These comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions aimed at reducing our lower margin sales to international customers and driving higher quality of sales overall. As a result, gross margins for our North America digital commerce expanded 500 basis points to last year. Going forward, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international shoppers. In North America wholesale, first-quarter revenue declined 93% as we parked nearly all shipments to North American wholesale partners starting in the fourth quarter due to COVID. However, we were encouraged by wholesale.com sell-out trends up mid-teens. Our sell-out rate in both wholesale.com and brick and mortar wholesale are significantly outperforming our sell-in as stores reopen. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next several quarters, as we continue to realign inventories to demand, and carefully monitor regional resurgence of the virus. We also continued reducing our penetration to the off-price channel in the quarter Moving on to Europe. First-quarter revenue declined 67% on a reported basis and 64% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 62%, with a 75% decline in our brick and mortar stores' comp, partly offset by a strong 44% increase in owned digital commerce. Across Europe, our brick and mortar comps were impacted by COVID related store closures for about two-thirds of the quarter, similar to North America. However, AUR was up 15% to last year led by our ongoing efforts to elevate our factory channel. Like North America, we continue to be cautious on the pace of bricks and mortar recovery in Europe, based on a number of uncertainties. Our own digital commerce comps were up 44% in the quarter, as we quickly pivoted our marketing, focused on new consumer acquisition, and accelerated Buy Online Ship from Store to leverage store inventories. Europe wholesale revenue declined 68% in constant currency, driven by our plan to reduce shipments during COVID to rightsize inventories in the marketplace. However, similar to North America, we saw continued momentum in wholesale.com and digital pure play sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year. Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 34% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency in the first quarter. Asia retail comps were down 33% to last year, with a 35% decline in our brick and mortar stores, partly offset by digital comps of 68%. Our performance in Korea and the Chinese Mainland continued to improve throughout the period, with Q1 sales up high single-digits and mid-teens to last year, respectively. Japan was the biggest headwind in the quarter, with Q1 sales down nearly 60% on government mandated store closures in April and May. Since reopening all of our stores in early June, the market appears to be recovering relatively well due to a loyal existing consumer base, largely mitigating pressure from weaker tourism. Other key markets, especially those with high levels of tourism like Hong Kong are on a more prolonged and variable recovery. Overall momentum in our Asia digital businesses continued through the quarter, even as stores reopened, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites, digital pure plays and wholesale.com. We drove a successful 618 campaign in Mainland China, including our first brand live-stream event on Timok. Looking ahead, as we navigate the current environment, we remain first and foremost, committed to the safety of our employees, partners and consumers. We continue to suspend guidance due to the high level of uncertainty and evolving situation surrounding COVID-19, including possible resurgences and additional economic shutdowns. Based on the current trends, however, we still expect Q1 to be the most significantly challenged quarter of the year on both the top and bottom line basis. While revenue decline should moderate gradually as we move through the year, we continue to expect second quarter revenues and operating profit to be down meaningfully, as well as full year fiscal '21 due to the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery. As Patrice mentioned, as we move through the pandemic, we are continuing our strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving profitability as we reposition the Company to return to sustainable long-term growth and value creation. In closing, we are operating in an incredibly dynamic environment and our teams are facing the challenge with real agility. We will continue to face headwinds, but our purpose, strategy and objectives are clear. And led by Ralph's enduring vision, we believe our discipline alongside a clear focus on continuing to elevate our iconic brand will enable us to emerge from this time in a position of strength. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Patrice, Jane, as you can see realized during and post-COVID, where are you focusing your Organization's energy to remain on the offense and winning in this new environment? You referred to upcoming adjustments to your strategy and the operating structure, can you provide more color on key considerations guiding this work? And for Jane, I understand you're not giving guidance, but what do you feel is not currently understood by the investment community as we try to model out the next few quarters? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Laurent. Welcome back. And thank you for your question. So listen, we are determined to win in this very dynamic environment, and as I look at our core strategic choices, which you know well, we believe they are broadly still relevant today. But obviously, the landscape is shifting rapidly and we're proactively evolving our strategy to remain on offense, which includes accelerating certain strategic choices over others. So, I thought I'd share a few examples of how our teams are working with agility and resilience to bring all this to life. First on winning over a new generation, we're putting even more emphasis on purpose and values based communication, and you saw some of that with our Pride campaign, recently, coupled with targeted, personalized digital marketing which - both of which are actually resonating quite well with current consumers, and new consumers, and you'll remember our ambition is to get to one-to-one marketing, ultimately. Within our product assortment, one of the thing, I think, that really stands out for Ralph Lauren relative to the number of players in our peer group is the fact that we are a lifestyle brand. We are now attached specifically to one product category or another, we truly have this incredible ability to flex across categories. And so, we're leveraging this to put more emphasis on areas that are resonating most with consumers right now. For example, that is both our focus on the core, and also new under-developed categories that we are focusing on now, like Home or Loungewear, for example. Within our ecosystem, so you'll remember, we're looking to build holistic omni-channel ecosystems in a limited number of big cities around the world. That's our go-to-market strategy. We're putting more emphasis on connected retail and refining how we integrate these capabilities within this ecosystem strategy. So connected retail, if you're familiar with all the capabilities that are available in this space, and I am actually really pleased with the work our teams have done over the past few weeks and months to ramp up Buy Online Pickup in Store, Buy Online Ship from Store, curbside, digital client selling, virtual appointments, book appointments online, and so on. And I think, probably, the Chinese Mainland situation is probably our best example of bringing all that to life, but it's actually been very energizing to see how this has been expanded across all of our regions. Fourth thing I would call out is related to this, actually, is really taking a digital first lens to everything that we do, whether that applies to how we interact with consumers, how we interact within our teams, virtual showrooms; we had our first Purple Label virtual showrooms a few weeks ago that was very successful, or 3D designs. And then finally, our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth, which is our fifth pillar, obviously doesn't stop here. With the changing environment, we're actively looking at our complete operating structure, where we are allocating resources and where we can drive more flexibility, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks. Now, of course, all of this work will require reshaping of our organization and footprint that align with these updated and accelerated strategic choices, which we look forward to talking to you more about in the coming months. Jane Nielsen : I'll take the second part of your question. And we're glad you're back. Let me try to give you some comments as you think about the next few quarters. Like many competitors we're watching changing regional dynamics and resurgences very carefully. But I think there is a second dynamic at play, which is the cadence of our business recovery, which really ties into our continued strategic focus on elevating our brands and driving quality of sales even during this pandemic. The way we're thinking about it based on what we know today is, I think, it's reasonable to expect that Q2 revenue will continue to see an improvement, but then our recovery will proceed at a more moderate pace than our Q1 exit rate, where we had the initial benefit of store re-openings. I think the most significant, uncontrollable is traffic, where we still expect it to be a pressure point as we move forward, along with the broader macroeconomic environment. However, what we can control are the proactive decisions that we are making to elevate our brands and position them to return to healthy and sustainable growth. Now that will play out on the wholesale side, in that, we expect our reported sell-in to continue to be heavily pressured as we prioritize healthier sell-out, and healthy inventory level. Our sell-out trends are encouraging, thus far, and our inventories were down meaningfully at the end of Q1, but we intend to continue this journey, especially through Q2. And on the DTC side, while nearly all of our stores are open, we expect the pace of recovery to be more gradual as we leverage this period to prioritize quality of sales, and meaningfully improve profitability in our DTC channel, especially our digital channel, where operating margins expanded by a 1,000 basis points in every region in Q1. Now, I know that these decisions in the short-term will temper the speed of recovery in our reported sales, in both DTC and wholesale, but it will better position our brands to return to more normalized trajectory as we move beyond this period. But we're analyzing this day-by-day, and really leaning into our strategic choices. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So, on North American wholesale, maybe - what's the best way to think about the pace of recovery as we think about North American wholesale in the second quarter or the back half of the year, relative to the 93% 1Q decline. And with that, Patrice, coming out of the pandemic, is there any way, maybe, just to elaborate on initiatives, or opportunities you see to re-map demand for the overall brand over time in the face of the partner door consolidation that we're seeing today? Jane Nielsen : Yes. Why don't I give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about North America wholesale, at least in the coming few months. We are, as I said, encouraged by the week-on-week improvements that we saw in Q1, although our trends were still negative as we exited the quarter. And we do expect that indoor and mall environment could remain challenged through the coming quarter. But as we move into fall holiday, we are very clear that we're going to continue to prioritize inventory management, which could be headwind to sell-out if demand picks up, but it is really important for our long-term strategy. But as we expect trends to improve as we move into fall, at that, when we expect to start to close the gap to get to more normalized levels that were pre-COVID as we enter into spring '21, we're still taking a cautious approach, but I think that that spring '21 starts us get to - starts - all things holding, start to get us back to that exit rate that we saw before we went into COVID. That said, there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, but we feel good about our position today, Matt. Our inventories are clean, we're keeping them that way. We're happy with our sell-out that we're seeing in the environment, but obviously, the environment has some uncertainty that we're watching. Patrice Louvet : And then, to the second part of your question in terms of re-mapping demand, and our focus is, specifically, I guess, on North America. If you look at our go-to-market strategy going forward, it has a few components. First, we want to focus on key cities, all right. And actually, which is to fund in the U.S. as we have a lot of white space opportunities from a key city standpoint. Second is, within each of these key cities, we want to make sure we have a balanced omni-channel ecosystem. And likewise here, we believe there are opportunities to rebalance it. So, what are the key components of it. First is our DTC, second is digital commerce, all right. And digital commerce is four components in our minds. It's ralphlauren.com site, and you heard Jane talk about all the work we're doing to elevate AUR, strengthen profitability, better connect with consumers moving forward. There are pure players, those - the presence is more limited in the U.S., but that business is developing, obviously, much stronger in Europe and in Asia. The third area is wholesale.com, which is very good momentum in the U.S. We're actually very pleased with the progress that we're making with our partners there. We're investing disproportionately additional capabilities with them to further accelerate our performance and enhance brand presence. And fourth is social commerce which is still nascent. So think of this as Instagram checkout, for example. We are now available on Instagram checkout. I think a little anecdote is we're are the first home business actually on Instagram checkout. We expect to see significant growth from these four components of digital commerce. And then, the third element of this plan is the top doors of our wholesale partners. And you've seen over the recent announcement that we have further reduced our footprint in wholesale to really focus even more on those top performing doors where we can both project the brand in a way that's consistent with the image we want to build and also drive the type of profitability that we know we need to achieve within this space. So, that's how we're thinking about it, we're going to leverage targeted marketing in order to guide consumers from those channel - those parts of the business that we are exiting to bring them into the parts of the business that represent the future of the company. And I have to say, over the past few months, we've ramped up our capabilities in terms of CRM consumer segmentation, consumer targeting, and we feel quite good about our ability to leverage this as a way to build our business and get back to growth and value creation in the long term. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : What should we think about it - just a quick modeling question. What should we think about as a sustainable run rate that we should expect for gross margin through this year? And then I have a follow-up, if it's okay. Jane Nielsen : Well, Michael - well, as you know, we're not giving specific guidance, but I think as you can think about the underlying gross margin expansion, if you look at Q1 in terms of gross margin, about two-thirds of the 730 basis points wasn't almost entirely channel and geography related due to COVID impact. So one-third was really driven by pricing and promotions, and underneath the covers, if you looked at AUR growth, we had our AUR growth in Q3, Q4 and into Q1, was exactly the same. So sort of the eight points that we called out in Q4, we - continued Q3, Q4, Q1, continued. So, we expect gross margin expansion for the year. I do expect there to be some volatility in underlying gross margin as we move through, and we move through some inventory management as we cycle through the year, but we are still calling for gross margin expansion for the year, with the benefits going to the - major benefit is going to be pricing and promotion work that we continue to do, the elevation work that we're doing, and continued benefits from geography, but they're going to be much less significant than what you saw in Q1. Q1, obviously, because of the impact of COVID was out stated. There are some offsets, in terms of FX, was a pressure, and I expect that to continue through the year because of our hedge positions. And some of the liquidation and excess that we move to factory has a higher cost and that has some pressure on gross margin as we move through as well. But those are the dynamics at play. We're very encouraged by our gross margin progress and expect to see it continue. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question. Operator : The next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Alexandra Walvis : Thanks so much for taking the question here. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the digital momentum and the digital operating margin. So firstly, can you talk in a little bit more detail on the drivers of that very strong digital operating margin, and where that margin now sits versus the stores and the wholesale? And then, my second question on digital, the North America growth number was a little weaker than the growth in international. I understand that part of that was the discipline that you're showing on pricing and promotions. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about balancing that going forward? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure. So, Alex, the number one driver of profitability across the regions in digital was our progress on AUR. We had extremely strong AUR, double-digit growth, AUR growth in Q1, led by AUR growth very strong in North America and across Europe. So, very positive, and the largest driver. Obviously, with the digital momentum we saw, we also saw nice SG&A leverage, especially, on our digital commerce sites in EMEA and Asia, where as we called out the comps were up in the 40s, and over 50% in Asia. So, very strong growth leveraging SG&A. We really worked to drive AUR by significantly reducing site wide promotions. We were down 43 days on a - to the quarter last year and the work that we're doing that Patrice called out in terms of personalization, and specific consumer targeting and personalization, we're very encouraged by that. And I think that those results are most notable as you look at into our EMEA results. As you called out, the pressure point in North America for us is our continued work on quality of sales which has pressured our international or Diego consumers, they were down over very strong double-digits. And that was counterbalanced by high teens growth in our domestic consumers. But as I pull apart the performance differences across region, really it is that international consumer that is the challenge point in North America. But very encouraging, over a 1,000 basis points of profitability improvement, led by gross margin and SG&A improvement across all the channels. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question. Operator : The next question comes from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Simeon Siegel : Hope you're both doing well through all this. Jane, congrats on that AUR and gross margin. Just - so as you look at that ability to drive those numbers on lower ads, did anything change in how you're thinking about the health and size of the business longer-term. And then, Patrice, just as you think about the marketing spend to your earlier point about being able to take share and being well capitalized, just curious on your thoughts on go-forward, how you're going to approach marketing. And then in this hopefully transitory period of meaningful revenue compression, how do you measure the return on marketing during the current period? Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Yes, I think that our continued progress, and I'm really calling out underlying AUR growth, gives us even more confidence in our gross margin story, over the long-term, and that the strength of our brand gives us confidence that this continued AUR story is durable over time and into the long-term, and just gives us conviction that we're doing the right work to elevate the brands and elevate our distribution. So, I think it just strengthens our confidence in our future, and the strength of the strategy. Patrice Louvet : And then, on marketing, specifically, if you see - obviously we're brand builders, first and foremost, right. We're storytellers, that's at the heart of this company, so we wanted to continue to invest in marketing. You've seen our progress over the past few years, progressing from kind of 3% of sales, on our way to at least 5%, and I'd like us to go beyond over time. So we're going to continue that, this year, based on our forecast where you will see a continued progression of marketing investment relative to sales compared to the prior year. When we look at how to structure the marketing activities, I think we're becoming even clearer now based on what we're seeing with consumers and what they're responding to, that this two-pronged approach is really working well for us. First element of the plan is really the storytelling around purpose, values based communication, whether that's first Polo, Pride, the flag stores picked activities that we did, recently, the support on diversity and inclusions, we're going to continue to drive that. And then, coupled with very targeted TRM digital marketing, and again the ambition here is to be able to do ultimately one-to-one marketing, so that the message you get, the way the site looks when you get on it is perfectly tailored to you, your profile, your history with us, your centers of interest, and I think we're making good progress there. In terms of measurement, which is near and dear to my heart, we've made good progress on a few capabilities. First of all, ROI, obviously, is the first lens that we look at, all right. And in some activities it's easy to calculate, on others, it's a little more complicated. So we couple that with new measurement that we have now on awareness, brand consideration, and purchase intent scores, which we're able to track in all of our core markets for ourselves versus the past, and versus our competitive set. And I actually feel very good, one, about our ability to measure. And two, about the progress that we are making based on what we saw this past quarter on all three of those metrics. Jane Nielsen : And Simeon, I just wanted to add some context to marketing spend, down 34% this quarter. But let me tell you, we remain very committed to increasing our marketing investments and growing our marketing investments faster than sales growth. In Q1, while our marketing declined, we anticipate that some of - that much of that is a shift as some of our key marketing events such as the Olympics and Wimbledon shifted out. So, you will see some of that shift for FY '21, and it will underscore our commitment to growing marketing faster than sales. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask about career, tailored, dress-you looks. Ralph Lauren's obviously a brand that has quite a heritage of tailored. Have you talked about the percentage of total trends in that business given what's happening with work-from-home? And then, Patrice, did you say in your comments around racial injustice that the company is thinking about evolving how it represents the American dream? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : So, product categories, first. Yes, obviously, we're selling less tuxedos and evening gowns right now, then maybe, we were prior to the crisis. Here's what we're excited about, Omar, is we are a lifestyle brand, right. So we're not pigeon-holed into tailored clothing or pigeon-holed into evening attire. We have the ability to play credibly across athleisure, across home, across - wear-at-home categories. And I think, we've been able to flex during the past quarter and as we look at our investments moving forward, we're obviously being very close to where the consumer behavior and where the consumer interests are. And making sure that we align perfectly to that, and I think we're able to do it in a way that's incredible. So, I feel good about that, and I think we will be able to navigate this crisis by flexing up and down based on where the consumer is really interested in going. As far as portraying the American dream is concerned, absolutely. I think, obviously, all the conversations we've had with our Black African-American colleagues inside the company, since the murder of George Floyd, and the discussions on racial injustice, and systemic racism, along with the conversations we had with the communities that we operate in, clearly, encouraged us to evolve how we project the American dream. How do we - what are the stories that we tell, what are the creators that we portray, how do we show up in a way that's really core to who we are fundamentally from a value standpoint, but evolve the execution to make sure that everywhere we connect with consumers, it is relevant in a 2020-2025 world. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Last question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from Erinn Murphy of Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : My question is around the wholesale channel. I think you referenced that you closed 200 lower performing doors in the quarter. Can you just expound upon what doors you've closed. And then, as you reassess your wholesale footprint, are there further points you see yourself pruning, not just here in North America, but also in U.S. Thank you. Patrice Louvet : So, our guiding principle, in terms of wholesale presence is really the combination of - and the brand show up in a way that is consistent with the image we want to build, and is the location financially attractive. So yes, as you mentioned, we've closed a bit more than 200 different locations in the U.S. over the past few months. It's pretty spread out, Erinn, across the different partners, right, including the one that declared bankruptcy, yesterday. But fully generalized, really looking at what are the top doors at our key partners and that's where we want to disproportionately focus. And then, we also want to work with them to accelerate even further digital commerce performance. As far as, what does the future entail, listen, we're going to stay agile, we're going to stay close to the market, we're going to stay close to our consumers, and we'll adjust as needed. We are finding that this significant intervention is what's needed at this point. So, I don't anticipate a major change in the coming months. But, obviously, we know in this time of uncertainty and disruption, the agile and the resilience are the ones that win, and we want to be part of that group. Erinn Murphy : Thank you. Patrice Louvet : All right. Well, listen, thank you to everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing our second quarter fiscal '21 results with you this fall. And in the meantime, take good care and have a wonderful day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn over the conference to our host Ms. Corinna Van Ghinst. Please go ahead. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Corey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our second quarter performance reflected solid progress on our path to return to growth. Our results were overall in line with our expectations with better-than-expected earnings driven by gross and operating margin expansion. While COVID-19 is still impacting physical store traffic and consumer behavior, we continue to take proactive measures to get ahead of these shifts and position our business to emerge from this crisis stronger than we came into it. These measures include accelerating our connected retail offerings globally, delivering high-value new customer acquisition, expanding key categories and international markets and realigning our cost structure. Throughout this period, we remain steadfastly focused on elevating our brand, and we were encouraged that underlying AUR growth outperformed our expectations this quarter, which is reflective of more personalized communications, reductions in promotional activity, geographic, channel and product mix benefit and strategic pricing increases. This acceleration of core strategies in the quarter remains consistent with the five strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan. These include : first, win over a new generation of consumers. Second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels, fourth, lead with digital across all activities, and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these areas in a moment. But first, let me review a few highlights related to our recovery this quarter. Overall, we were encouraged that our performance improved sequentially in each of our geographies led by Asia and across our digital channels globally. Nevertheless, while we are confident in our strategy to return to growth, we remain cautious as our path to recovery may not be linear over the next few months, given meaningful traffic headwinds and a significant amount of uncertainty in the global environment. Looking across our regions. Asia is the furthest along on the path to recovery. This was driven by positive sales in the Chinese Mainland, which returned to pre-COVID growth levels of more than 30% as government restrictions were lifted as well as in Korea. Strong sequential improvement in our North America and Europe comp trends in the second quarter, and we continue to monitor each of our markets closely, by channel. While our brick-and-mortar performance was still challenged due to store traffic headwinds, we reported solid digital comps in all three regions this quarter. This was driven by expanded connected retail offerings and an emphasis on product categories like home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today, with notably less focus on formal tailored workwear and occasion dressing. Within our Wholesale business, we were also encouraged by sequential progress across regions this quarter, particularly on a sell-out basis and led by wholesale dot-com. Our sell-in continues to improve, but is lagging our recovery in direct-to-consumer as planned, as we exited department store doors in the first quarter and focus on prioritizing inventory management in this environment. This near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation and long-term equity of our brands. Next, I want to spend a moment digging a little deeper into our digital transformation, which cuts across everything we do from how we create the best possible experience for our consumers to new ways of working as a company and with our partners. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is central to our recovery and return to growth. We now have a comprehensive offering of connected retailing options, enabling our consumers to interact with the world of Ralph Lauren in new and more personal ways. These include virtual client selling and appointment booking, buy online, pick up in store, curbside pickup, mobile checkout and contactless payments. We launched our pilot Ralph Lauren virtual store experience this quarter, bringing our Beverly Hills flagship store experience, online through a mix of multimedia and augmented reality capabilities wherever you are in the world, you can shop and interact with this unique store experience through your device. Along with our expanded connected retail options, we plan to roll out more virtual flagship shopping experiences, this holiday and beyond. In addition to our consumer facing enhancements, we also continue to digitize how we work as an organization. This quarter we began to roll out our digital value chain initiative that will streamline how we bring products to market and make it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile. Some key components of this include, implementing 3D digital product creation and virtual fittings, rolling out digital showrooms and expanding our stepwise buying capabilities, enabling us to make purchase decisions closer to market. While I am encouraged by these successful rollouts in the midst of COVID. We still have significant opportunity to continue integrating digital into how we work to enable greater effectiveness and efficiency. Turning out to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the second quarter, we continue to ramp-up our personalization initiatives, including targeted email campaigns with predictive AI and high reach paid social media, helping to drive traffic and conversion to our channels. We added more than a million new customers to our direct to consumer platforms alone in Q2. And as consumers are learning to live and work in new ways, we are likewise developing new ways of inspiring and engaging us. Let me share a few of the highlights from Q2. First, we were the first ever fashion brand to enable consumers to mix and match branded garments, inspired by real life designs on Snapchat, through our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji collection. Over 10 million users dress their Bitmoji and Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 250 million times this quarter. Our 360 degree marketing campaign included influencer and celebrity partnerships with a live stream concert by Chance the Rapper from our Chicago flagship and augmented reality portal on Snapchat. Successfully connecting with Gen Z audiences, Ralph Lauren reached leadership share a voice on social media, through this launch. We also announced the winner of our Polo design for good contest in Q2, entitled, Just Let Me Breathe, by artists Michelle Smith. This was a great example of how we are engaging with our super fans who submitted their artwork for display on an exclusive polo shirt with the campaign generating more than 300 million PR impressions. It also connects to our core values, which Ralph established more than 50 years ago when he started this company with all proceeds of the winning shirt going to COVID-19 relief. Other high impact activities to recruit new consumers this quarter included our partnership with the popular Netflix show Elite outfitting BTS\u2019s as official music video for Dynamite, a campaign supporting the Wimbledon foundation in the absence of this year's tournament and our continued sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis and PGA Championships, as we further strengthen our position in the world of sports globally. These initiatives help to deliver an acceleration of our global brand awareness and purchase intent since the start of the pandemic, particularly with next generation consumers. And our total social media followers exceeded 44 million in the second quarter, led by our expansion on TikTok, as well as double-digit growth on Instagram. Looking ahead, our upcoming holiday campaigns will focus more than ever before, on digital experiences from the expansion of our virtual stores to our PolarBear game with a live stream gaming event on Twitch. Our campaigns will also feature a much greater emphasis on gifting this holiday across all of our channels. This represents a key opportunity globally with 74% of consumers we surveyed recently highlighting Ralph Lauren, as a brand that is great for gifting. I also want to touch on our work to operate with discipline secure growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth, with productivity has been an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure, so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major action related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan, the simplification of our organizational structure. This is designed to enable our teams to move with even greater agility and focus on what matters most, including our digital transformation. Another element of our strategic review process we discussed last quarter was an assessment of our brand portfolio. Today, we announced that we are transitioning our Chaps business to a fully licensed model. This shift is consistent with our long-term strategy from several aspects. First, it will enable us to put even greater focus on elevating our core namesake brands in the marketplace. Second, it will reduce our total direct exposure to the North America brick-and-mortar department store channel, notably the more moderate tiers. And third, this move will create incremental value for the company by setting up chats to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner in the sector that is focused on nurturing the burn. We are making good progress on our multi-pronged realignment plan, which gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do.  Q2 marked the kick-off of our participation in the CEO action for ratio equality fellowship, focused on advancing ratio quality and social justice in public policy. And the McKinsey Black leadership Academy aimed at developing and empowering our next-generation of black leaders on a global scale. On the sustainability front, we were excited to announce a minority investment in natural fiber welding, a leading sustainable material science start-up that has revolutionized the use of natural fibers and reuse of cotton waste into patented high-performance materials. Our investment will help to expand the market and ecosystem that supports the use of recycled cotton. In closing, Ralph and I want to thank our teams for their incredible resilience, dedication and agility as we continue to navigate through challenging conditions around the world. In this unprecedented environment, we recognize the opportunity to accelerate key strategic priorities and continue to deliver Ralph's iconic vision in an elevated way to all of our consumers across all of our channels. And before I turn it over to Jane, I want to extend a warm welcome to our newest Board member, Valerie Jarrett, Valerie's breadth of experience across the private and public sectors and unparalleled expertise in government, law and business will bring great perspective to the boardroom. And Ralph and I are confident that her experience and leadership will be invaluable.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ms. Nielsen, your line is open. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Angela. And good morning, everyone. We were encouraged by our team's execution and continued business progress in the second quarter. In the midst of a still challenging operating environment, we delivered sequential improvement across all regions, expanded our gross margins through continued AUR growth and brand elevation and reduced expenses across the company. Importantly, our balance sheet is very strong with $2.4 billion of cash and investments, enhanced by ongoing working capital efficiencies. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and in the channels that matter most to consumers today, notably, an increased emphasis on our digital transformation. We continue to be cautious about the pace and regional variability of COVID recovery as well as consumer behavior, especially with the rise of restrictions, with the resurgence of COVID cases, notably in Europe. We are intensely focused on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the global pandemics. This includes elevating our powerful lifestyle brands and maintaining a strong balance sheet, while also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. To achieve this goal, in September, we announced the first stage of our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan, designed to support future growth and profitability while creating a sustainable cost structure. Our full strategic review process includes the evaluation of our team organizational structures and ways of working, our real estate footprint and related costs across distribution centers, corporate offices and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors and our brand portfolio. We announced actions related to the first initiative, reshaping our organization to align to our strategic growth priorities. These are estimated to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $180 million to $200 million. We anticipate a substantial portion of these savings will flow through to the bottom line beginning in fiscal 2022. In connection with the organizational reshaping, we expect to incur a total pretax charge of approximately $160 million. The majority of this charge was recorded in the second quarter. As Patrice mentioned, we announced today that we are transitioning our North American Chaps menswear and womenswear business to a fully licensed model, starting in the second half of fiscal 2022. Although the change is not material, we look forward to updating you on the business transition and progress in the coming months. Moving on to second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues declined 30% compared to a 66% decline in Q1 with performance across all three regions, still adversely impacted by COVID. Total direct-to-consumer comps were down 28%, while global Wholesale revenues declined 37%. Our bricks-and-mortar comps were down 33% following a 66% decline in the first quarter. AUR improvements were more than offset by traffic declines of more than 40% versus last year and limited store operating hours, due to health and safety regulations, consistent with the broader environment. Looking ahead to holiday, we are proactively working to drive traffic and comps through multiple levers, which include increasing high ROI performance marketing, expanding personalization and social commerce program and leveraging our connected retail capabilities, including new features that will be rolled out for holiday. Our brick-and-mortar declines were partially offset by a 12% comp increase in our owned Ralph Lauren digital commerce business. And more importantly, our digital profitability continue to improve with Q2 digital operating margins expanding more than 1,000 basis points to last year through a combination of higher quality of sales and SG&A leverage. With digital representing our fastest-growing channel in the company, driving profitability in this business remains important, not only to our long-term margin accretion, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Second quarter AUR growth of 26% was above our expectations, led by double-digit increases in North America and Europe. Excluding the COVID-related mix impact, underlying AUR still grew more than 20% to last year. This underlying AUR growth represented an acceleration from the first quarter and is above the low to mid single-digit growth we guided to for fiscal 2021. We plan to drive further AUR growth this year as we elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotional depth and duration, drive favorable mix and take targeted pricing increases, particularly in North America. Our confidence in this brand elevation strategy is reinforced by our continued improvements in full price penetration rates, basket sizes and better-than-expected conversion, even as we reported higher AUR growth. Adjusted gross margin was 66.5% in the second quarter, up 500 basis points to last year. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong AUR improvements and favorable geographic and channel mix shift, as our higher AUR gross margin Asia business recovered faster than North America and Europe. Approximately two-third of our gross margin expansion was driven by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions, with the remainder driven by mix shifts that were outsized given COVID impacts. SG&A expenses declined 19% to last year on savings from employee furloughs, store rents and government subsidies as well as lower selling and marketing expenses. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 12.6%, down 230 basis points to last year. Marketing declined 31% as COVID canceled or limited the activation of key events like Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and Fashion Week. And we shifted some demand creation activities later in the year. We also continue to pivot investments from in-store and event-based engagements toward longer term brand building activities focused on digital and our values based messaging, as Patrice discussed. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Revenue decreased 38% to last year. Retail comps declined 32%, driven by a 40% decline in brick-and-mortar comps, while our owned digital comps increased 10%. Brick-and-mortar comps were primarily impacted by a steady but measured recovery in retail traffic, including a significant decline in foreign tourist sales in the quarter, consistent with the broader market. AUR for the quarter was up over 20%, driven by significantly reduced promotions and our continued rollout of targeted ticket price increases in factory stores. Our digital commerce comps accelerated to 10% from 3% growth in the first quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers, high teens while sales to international and daigou [ph] customers declined double digits to last year, as planned. Stronger sales to domestic consumers were driven by our investments in connected retailing, such as buy online, pickup in-store and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. Our digital marketing work generated a 37% increase in new customers this quarter, driving our full-price sales penetration higher. Similar to last quarter, these comp gains were tempered by a significant planned reduction in promotions to drive higher quality of sales, while also serving to reduce lower-margin sales to international daigou customers. We reduced our total site-wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year period. As a result, our digital AUR was also up over 20%, and gross margins for North America digital commerce expanded more than 1,000 basis points to last year. Through this fiscal year, our plan is to continue driving stronger profitability in this channel, while on the revenue side, balancing strong domestic growth with a steady reduction in sales to international promotion seeking shoppers. In North America Wholesale, second quarter revenues declined 46% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realign inventories to demand. The decline was partially offset by a modest shift in timing of shipments to rebalance inventory before holiday. At the end of Q2, our inventories at wholesale were clean and well-positioned, down more than 40% at North America wholesale. We are encouraged that our sell-out rates in wholesale are still significantly outperforming sell-in. However, we expect further pressure on reported sell-in over the next few quarters, as we continue to manage inventories carefully. Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue declined 25% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 29%, with a 35% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by a strong 26% increase in our owned digital commerce.  Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar comps were impacted by traffic headwinds similar to North America. However, AUR was up over 20% to last year, led by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel.  We continue to be cautious on the pace of brick-and-mortar recovery in Europe based on the growing intensity of second waves of COVID, along with other macro uncertainties. Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comps was driven by our new consumer acquisition up 30%, along with new site functionalities, connected retailing initiatives and enabled by the launch of our new brick-and-mortar, I will say new back-end LMS platform in the quarter. We were also excited to go live on Farfetch this quarter with a marketing campaign launching in time for holiday.  Europe wholesale revenue declined 27% in constant currency as we continue to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. However, we saw continuing momentum in wholesale.com and digital pure plays sell-out performance through the period, with strong double-digit growth to last year led by key platforms such as About You, Asos and Zalando.  Turning to Asia. Revenue declined 7% on a reported basis and 8% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps improved from on a 33% decline in the first quarter to an 11% decline in Q2. Brick-and-mortar stores were down 12% partially offset by digital comps up 32%.  We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese Mainland is back to pre-COVID levels of more than 30%. However, Japan continued to be the biggest headwind in the quarter, with sales declining 17%. Following our store reopenings in early June, the market entered a second wave of COVID cases which impacted our performance, along with weaker tourism. The decline was partially offset by stronger-than-expected growth on our new digital site launched in June.  Other key markets, especially those with higher levels of tourism like Hong Kong continue to be on a more variable and prolonged recovery. Overall, momentum in our agent digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by a strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays.  Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.6 billion in cash and investments and $693 million in total debt at the end of last year's second quarter.  Net inventory declined 12% to last year with double-digit declines in North America and Europe and a 9% increase in Asia. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventories through the pandemic, overall, we were encouraged by our team's ability to merchandise around our core and iconic styles as well as key COVID categories like home and athleisure.  Our increased agility is also enabling us to shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers return to more normalized trends. Our tightly managed inventories, combined with our strong AUR and gross margin performance through the first half of the year give us increased confidence, that we are taking the right strategic approach to move through excess Prim 20 [ph] product, while also positioning the company for sustainable future growth. Meanwhile, our supply chain teams continue to improve our lead times and fast track capabilities to chase potential increases in demand. Looking ahead, we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios, given the high level of uncertainty and evolving situation surrounding COVID-19. Based on our assessment of developing business trends and our strategic plans, we want to share some details on how we are thinking directionally about the rest of the fiscal year. First, we expect our financial results for both the third quarter and full year fiscal 2021 to continue to be adversely impacted by the pandemic and prolonged demand recovery. We expect gross margins to continue expanding in the second half of the year, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first half. Improved pricing and promotion, including targeted consumer messaging should continue to be the most durable driver. Based on our year-to-date progress on our brand elevation strategy, we now expect AUR to grow low double digits this year, exceeding our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit average growth annually. We expect these tailwinds to be partly offset by higher production costs in the back half. As we outlined at the start of the pandemic, we plan to clear excess full price merchandise, primarily through our factory channels. We continue to expect declines in operating expenses to moderate with the highest level of dollar spend in the third quarter around holiday. Our first half results included one-time benefits from employee furloughs, rent abatements, executive compensation reductions and government subsidies that are not likely to repeat in the second half. We also shifted a meaningful portion of marketing investments to the back half of the year to position our business for growth as we emerge from the crisis, with first half marketing expense declining 32% to last year but expected to grow about 10% in the second half. Note that cost savings associated with our organizational realignment and any additional potential actions are expected to begin primarily in fiscal 2022. Lastly, our tax rate may be higher and more volatile this year. This is due to impacts from stock compensation and non-deductible items under tax reform as well as limitations on tax benefits from losses eligible for carryback under the Cares Act. In closing, guided by our clear purpose and strategy along with the strength of our Timeless brand and Ralph's creative vision, we are encouraged by the progress we have made over the first two quarters of the year. Our brand elevation is working across every geography. We are accelerating our push into digital, and we are driving even greater cost discipline as we make difficult decisions around realigning our organization and footprint around the world. While we continue to navigate a highly dynamic global environment, our teams are laser-focused on managing through this period to position the company to return to healthy and sustainable growth. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats team on the strong profitability this quarter. Jane Nielsen : Thanks, Omar. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Omar. Omar Saad : Good morning. Patrice, understanding that the current COVID environment is highly unpredictable. There's not a lot of visibility. But if you look beyond the near-term headwinds, can you elaborate on your comments that you plan to emerge from the crisis stronger than you came into it. And could you include a discussion also of a recently announced reorg last month and how that fits in? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Sure. Well, thanks for your question. First and foremost, our strength comes from our teams and their incredible dedication, resilience and agility have fueled our progress in -- during these challenging times. Our team's engagement, coupled with a laser focus on strategic priorities and also proactively reducing our exposure to the most structurally challenged parts of our businesses, leads me to actually have great confidence that right now, the fundamentals of the company are actually stronger than when we came into this crisis. Let me elaborate on both areas. First, the strategic growth areas, and then I'll talk about how we're tackling the structural headwinds for the company. So, strategic growth focus area is really centered on elevating our brand, right? We have one of the best brands in the world at hector resiliency and authentic consumer connection during COVID. Our latest read on purchase intent over the past six months since the crisis started indicates actually our purchase intent, our brand consideration scores are up versus pre-crisis. Second point is accelerating digital growth and profitability, right? We've been adding connected retail functionality. We've driven a great focus on personalization in the interaction with our customers and also a strong drive on quality of sales. The third area is recruiting high-quality new consumers, bringing in consumers who buy at higher prices and are really at the sweet spot of our general targeting. And we also saw very strong consumer growth on ralphlauren.com over the past quarter versus prior year. Fourth area is driving high potential underdeveloped markets and categories, namely China, outerwear, and home. And then finally, it's realigning our organization and cost structure to support our future growth and deliver for the numbers we announced a few weeks ago, at least $180 million of savings. So, those are the strategic growth focus areas. And then we're really tackling head on the most challenging areas of the business, and I'll quote the top three. One is our North America brick-and-mortar wholesale presence; the second is our off-price penetration; and the third is the underperformance of our non-core brands. So we closed another 200 underperforming North America Wholesale doors over the past few months. If you step back a little bit, Omar, and you look at the past three-year time frame, we've basically reduced our North America Wholesale brick-and-mortar presence by over 50%. We closed more than 50% of our doors. We also continued to reduce the penetration of off-price in our business, significantly this past quarter. Likewise, to step back and look at the past three year focus and progress, we've reduced the penetration of our off-price business by more than half. And then finally, you heard in our prepared remarks the fact that we are transitioning the Chaps brand, which is roughly $200 million in revenue to a value-accretive, fully-licensed model. So although, we recognize we're still operating in a highly volatile environment and clearly yesterday's new restrictions in Europe are unfortunately a good reminder of this and we will need to continue to manage with agility as we have since the beginning of this pandemic as we kind of work through it. We are focused on strategically positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation. Specifically, Omar to your question on the organization reshaping work that we announced a few weeks ago. So it fits perfectly into the strategic focus areas that we have called out. We really looked ahead and said, okay, next three to five years, what are the key growth areas for the company? What are the key capabilities that we need to succeed? And how do we align our organization structure, our ways of working, our investment levels to make sure that we're taking advantage of all these growth factors. And so what you've seen through our announcement for the reshaping work is a reflection of that. And also, of course, the adjustment of our cost structure to reflect the -- where the business is today and where, again, we want to allocate our resources. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So Patrice, could you speak maybe to the range of current business trends that you're seeing across the portfolio, specifically Polo versus Lauren? And then, Jane, how best to think about the progression of revenues in the back half of the year relative to the 30% decline in the second quarter? And maybe specifically, do you believe a return to consolidated growth is feasible by the fourth quarter? Patrice Louvet : Sure. Good morning, Matt. Well, on the brand performance, and we don't get into the specific by brand. But what I can tell you is the bigger parts of the company is the Polo brand, and that is the part of the company that has the strongest progression rates. On the other parts of the portfolio, some of which are work-in-progress like the work that we've been doing on Lauren over the past year. We're feeling good about the pivots that have been made on product, the pivots that have been made on marketing and encouraged by the progress that we're seeing across the channels. The same is true for our luxury labels, purple label and collection and RRL [ph]. Jane Nielsen : Yes, Matt from a second half perspective, here is what we were encouraged by in the quarter. We were really encouraged by the progress we saw from Q1 to Q2. Now as we think about the future, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the second wave shutdowns. In our assessment, this is the biggest potential impact to second half recovery and is why we continue to plan around a number of demand scenarios. We're, obviously, encouraged by the recovery in the Chinese Mainland, getting back to pre-COVID levels of growth, but are cautious given the announcements of what we saw in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, and it's the rising case count in North America. Given the current dynamics, we're not guiding for when we will return to pre-COVID levels. We're looking at trends in terms of the challenges in bricks-and-mortar traffic, the tourism trends that will take longer to recover. And the work that Patrice referenced, which is our proactive cleanup of North America distribution, notably in wholesale and in off-price wholesale. And from a timing perspective, obviously, we expected this point that recovery will continue to be led by Asia, followed by Europe and North America, subject to second wave. So we continue - I think our teams continue to manage agilely through this. We think it's prudent not to give guidance given what's happening in the marketplace today, but we are managing what we can control through the second half. And that's price, AUR, gross margin expense. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow : Hey, good morning everyone. I hope you're all well. Yes. So Jane, just two quick one\u2019s for you. So I appreciate the gross margin commentary in the back half. Could you talk a little bit more specifically about the next quarter just because of how important it is? And I know it seems like you've got some good mix benefits from China and DTC, but I'm assuming we should expect gross margin expansion in both quarters. But I'm kind of curious if you could talk around the gross margin for the upcoming quarter? And then just at a higher level, maybe it's too early to go into this, but can you possibly begin to help us think about the pacing of recovery in the U.S. wholesale channel based on your conversations with your partners, when are you expecting \u2013 quote, unquote \u2013 normalized growth rate kind of return? Just any help on the pacing of recovery in that channel specifically would be great. Thanks so much. Jane Nielsen : Thanks, Ike. So we're not guiding to specific gross margins by quarter, but I can tell you that we do expect expansion in gross margin as we move through the second half. And I believe that our drivers are durable in the third and fourth quarter. And we're very much encouraged by the progress we've made, albeit, I do expect that gross margin expansion is not going to be at the pace that you saw in the first half. In terms of the pacing of wholesale, what we've said is we do expect, given what we see today in terms of the environment that spring 2021 will continue to improve from where we're at today. We know that fall 2020 was constrained by our proactive inventory management, with inventories down 40% in North America wholesale. We do expect this spring sell-in to improve sequentially, but this is going to be a paced recovery. And obviously, our wholesale partners are watching what's happening in North America as carefully as we are. So there's still a bit of uncertainty in that environment, but that's our expectation. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning. The speed model\u2026 Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Dana. Dana Telsey : Hi. And the improvement in speed with the three month lead times is very impressive. What do you see the opportunity of that going forward? Does it differ at all by classification? And what is that benefit to the gross margin going forward? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : So speed has been the real focus area for us. I'm glad you called it out Dana. And now we're at a stage where more than 25% of our business is on less than three month lead times. Whereas last year, if you'd ask me what that number was, it would have been low single digits. So tremendous progress from our GMMs team to build capabilities with our suppliers to move a lot faster, we're really looking at three, six, nine month blocks. But what you can expect from us is a continued acceleration of the pace. We have a project that the team developed recently as part of our vote campaign that was actually achieved in a matter of days, not even months, not even weeks, but a matter of days, which gives me a lot of confidence that we're continuing to build the capabilities that will enable us to be incredibly reactive, which obviously, in this environment is critical, give us the ability to chase even further, which again is critical in this environment. So Dana, I suspect a year from now when we sit down together and look at our rate of development that we \u2013 you will continue to see very strong progress on speed for the company. Jane Nielsen : And the primary benefit of this \u2013 from a gross margin standpoint is the reduction of excess and a reduction in vendor allowances and NRV, as we're able to re-demand closer and fulfill demand and fulfill product closer to reading demand, and that should be durable as we improve our reaction times. Dana Telsey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Michael. Michael Binetti : I have two different questions. I think he will go to Jane, but Patrice, any color helpful too. But you've got a number of projects going on with the distribution channels, the regions, the pricing structure, the store fleet and some of the costs in the investment lines here. They all have different durations, they all have different payback periods. But when you add it up, when and how do you think the prioritization of the projects as you laid them out, realistically translate to revenue growth back above the levels we saw in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2020? And then as a follow-up, maybe you look at it a little bit of a different way through the profitability lens. Maybe a different way to ask it is what level of sales do you think you need to achieve the level of EBIT dollars that you saw in fiscal 2019? Because I know you're working hard on the margins as well. Jane Nielsen : Yes. We are working hard on the margins. As I look at the actions that we announced and the combination of work that's in progress, such as the Chaps operating model, which you will see the benefit of the org reshaping work largely in fiscal 2022. And as we called out, that will be a gross savings of $180 million to $200 million. The benefit of the Chaps, while much smaller in magnitude would occur post transition in August. And then the work that we're doing on continuing ground portfolio valuation and real estate would likely flow through in fiscal 2022, but closer to year-end in fiscal 2022. In terms of -- we are focused on margin right now. Some of these actions like moving Chaps to a wholesale model will be helpful from a profitability standpoint. But obviously, as you shift to a license model, I'm sorry, that compresses your total dollars of revenue. We factored that into our thinking and are really focused on getting our -- focusing on our operating profitability. We're not guiding to sort of a time of recovery to pre-2019 levels. There's too much uncertainty out there, but that is certainly our long-term mind set. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Yes. Hey, good morning, Patrice and Jane. Thanks for taking my question. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, John. John Kernan : Congrats on all the progress in managing the business through this environment. Patrice Louvet : Thanks. John Kernan : And maybe just to dovetail on that on the prior question. How should we think about the mix shift to direct and digital on your overall margin structure? Historically, the Wholesale business was a higher-margin business for the company, I think, globally, particularly in North America. So how do we think about that overall margin structure of the company when going more direct seems like an enormous initiative for the company? Patrice Louvet : That's a very good question, John. And it's very top of mind for us. That's why all the focus -- let's focus on digital, first and foremost. All our focus on ralphlauren.com is about brand elevation, but enhancing the experience and it's about step changing the profitability. Because anyone can grow dot com operations aggressively at no profit, right? But that's not the game we're in, or the game we're in is ralphlauren.com needs to be accretive to the region from a profitability standpoint. We have achieved that in Asia. We have achieved that in Europe, and we're on our way to achieving that in North America. You saw from our prepared remarks, our margin this past quarter in ralphlauren.com US is up 1,500 basis points, which is a massive growth. And our objective is to make sure that we're excited about moving consumers to that channel and recruiting consumers into that channel, because it will be accretive to the profitability of the region. So we're working on both making sure we're bringing in high-value customers and also have the right AUR, gross margin, SG&A structure to support that moving forward, because you're right that the direction of travel for this company is more direct to consumer in terms of split by channel, and we're keen to make sure that the profitability structure follows that. Jane Nielsen : And we expect to close this year achieving the goal of having digital be accretive to the region in every region that we operate in and exceeding in North America are our Wholesale margins. So that's a big accomplishment. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. John Kernan : Excellent. And maybe just one more follow-up. The $180 million to $200 million gross cost savings. Can you talk about how -- when we approach our Excel models, how we should think about that from fiscal 2022 on the overall SG&A dollar base and models, how we should think about that from fiscal any potential offsets to those gross savings? Jane Nielsen : Yes. I think what we're seeing now is that in -- from our order shaping work, we're going to flow through substantial -- the majority of that through to the bottom line, understanding that we will be making in -- some investments in to accelerate into growth, but I think that as you think about your model, the majority of that will flow through. John Kernan : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks. Good morning. My question is around the 40% traffic decline you called out for Q2. Could you just share how it looked by region? And then maybe more specifically, as we've moved into the third quarter with Europe in the second wave, you've obviously spoken to some caution. What are you seeing now? And are the retailers there, are they kind of a little bit more cautious as they order for spring/summer 2021. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : So we saw fairly similar traffic patterns in Europe and North America to our brick-and-mortar stores. China encouraging returned to pre-COVID levels of traffic and really led across Asia. And \u2013 but we're encouraged by the trajectory we're seeing at, especially by our largest market in Japan that continues to recover following the second wave. Patrice Louvet : And on your European wholesale question, I think, what we've seen is actually encouraging progress on our partners, both wholesale kind of brick and click and also pure players. And as you know, we have a very strong pure player business in Europe. The recent flare-ups happened yesterday. So I don't know that, that's been reflected in the numbers yet. And, obviously, we approach this with a good level of caution, but we were encouraged with what we \u2013 the response we were getting to our product portfolio from our European wholesale partners for spring 2021. Erinn Murphy : Thank you. And can I\u2026 Corinna Van der Ghinst : Have the last question, please, Angela. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Jane Nielsen : Good morning. Patrice Louvet : Hey, Adrienne. Adrienne Yih : Happy to see the progress. Patrice, I guess my question for you, I liked your comment about the \u2013 attracting the new millennial customer. I was wondering if you can give us some metrics or feedback from what you're hearing from both millennial and Gen Z consumers? And then, Jane, my last question for you is your comment based on in spring 2021, you'll be in an improved inventory position. Are you seeing evidence of kind of that stabilized demand in forward bookings for spring 2021? Or is the comment more on the controllable side that you will have a better inventory position? Thank you very much. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So, Adrienne, on the consumer front, we're actually very excited about the response we're seeing from millennials/Gen Z consumers. As you know, we have very deliberate actions to appeal to that customer group, whether that's where we show up from a media standpoint, whether that's the type of activity that we have, like our pretty special Bitmoji program, or whether that's the type of influencer that we partner with. But what we have seen in terms of next-generation performance over the past two quarters, there's actually significant progress within the customer base below the age of 35, basically across all three regions. Now you would expect that in China, because a big chunk of population is there, but we're also seeing that actually in Europe and in North America. So with the tracking that we now do, we \u2013 I think we've got much greater visibility to that, encouraged by the traction. And obviously, we'll continue to fuel it. And you saw in our earnings release that we intend to increase our marketing spending in the back half, so Q3, Q4, plus 10% versus last year, a good deal of the activities that will be funded are specifically targeted at the millennial Gen Z population. Jane Nielsen : Yes. In terms of our outlook for Wholesale Spring '21. We know that our inventory positions will be better. That's what we can control. Obviously, demand is -- remains the biggest uncertainty, but we're encouraged by the conversations that we've had with our wholesale partners thus far. Patrice Louvet : Well, listen, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our third quarter fiscal '21 results with you in February. And in the meantime, stay safe, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our third quarter performance reflected strong underlying progress on our path to quality, sustainable long-term growth. Overall, revenues improved sequentially and were in line with our expectations. Stronger-than-expected recovery in Asia was offset by the impact of continued COVID-19 resurgences across Europe, while North America was roughly in line with our expectations, even with additional COVID pressures. Meanwhile, our focus on brand elevation, improved quality of sales and cost discipline drove better-than-expected gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter with double-digit AUR growth and digital profitability, exceeding our expectations.  And while COVID is likely to remain a near-term headwind, there is reason to be hopeful as we start the new year and vaccines begin to roll out. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the dedication, resilience and agility our teams have shown in not only managing through the pandemic, but also positioning the company to emerge stronger than we came into it.  As part of this, we balanced reset activities with an acceleration of our core strategies, including strengthening our brand and bolstering our marketing and new customer acquisition, expanding key categories in international markets, scaling our connected retail offerings globally, continuing to prune non-elevating distribution and further realigning our cost structure. These actions are consistent with the 5 strategic priorities that we laid out as part of our long-term plan prior to COVID. These include : first, win over a new generation of consumers; second, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories; third, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels; fourth, lead with digital across all activities; and fifth, operate with discipline to fuel growth. I will touch on a few of these in a moment.  But first, let me provide some updates specific to this quarter's performance. As we anticipated at the start of the holiday season, the global retail environment remained volatile due to the pandemic and other macro factors. Nevertheless, apart from the impact of COVID resurgences, we were encouraged by several bright spots in each of our regions this quarter, led notably by Asia and our digital channels globally.  Asia, which we view in many ways as a blueprint for our progress in other markets, grew 14% to last year. This was driven by continued momentum in the Chinese mainland, with more than 40% reported growth. Japan returned to positive growth in the quarter, while Korea was up double digits. In North America, performance continued to improve sequentially and was in line with our expectations despite rising COVID cases in many of our key markets. Our strategy of elevating our brand across digital, department stores and off-price is well underway, and we're still on track to complete the significant portion of this work in fiscal '21. Europe was the most challenging segment this quarter, with the majority of our stores closed for a full month of the key holiday period. In addition to the government-mandated shutdowns, there were also significant operating and travel restrictions throughout the quarter, which have continued into our fourth quarter to date.  In many ways, the second and third wave restrictions have been more disruptive than the first wave of shutdowns we experienced last spring as they vary greatly by market and by day. Third quarter traffic headwinds were partly mitigated by a strong acceleration across our own and wholesale digital channels in Europe. This was driven by our expanded connected retail programs, exclusive capsules with partners like MyTheresa and ASOS, holiday campaigns and influencer activations. We also leveraged this period of disruption to continue our long-term brand elevation in the region, acquiring new high-value consumers and driving increased AUR despite a highly promotional competitive environment. These actions should help position our brands for healthier recovery and ecosystem expansion once we emerge from COVID.  By channel, digital continues to be a key driver of our performance, with digital sales accelerating in all 3 regions this quarter. We continue to scale up our connected retail offerings and emphasize gifting in key product categories for holiday. These included our iconic sweaters, Holiday Bear programs, home and loungewear that are resonating with consumers today.  In our brick-and-mortar stores, as I mentioned, traffic was challenged due to COVID, particularly in Europe and North America. But we were strongly encouraged that our teams were able to deliver higher conversion in these channels with double-digit AUR growth and reduced discounting, while also starting to leverage our new connected retail offerings this holiday.  We also continue to invest in targeted new store expansion in key growth markets with 23 new stores this quarter, primarily in Asia. Within our wholesale business, we were encouraged by continued sequential progress across regions, particularly on Wholesale Dot Com. We still expect pressure on our reported sell-in trends in the near-term as we deliberately exited department store doors early in the pandemic and prioritized inventory management in this environment. As a reminder, this near-term discipline is integral to building price harmonization across our ecosystem and to protecting the elevation in long-term equity of our brands.  Turning to our efforts to win over a new generation. In the third quarter, we continued to ramp up our personalization initiatives, shift our brand-building efforts increasingly toward digital, and leverage the authentic values that have been central to our brand since Ralph started this company more than 50 years ago. Let me touch on some of the highlights from this quarter. First, we launched a fully integrated and diverse Family Is Who You Love holiday campaign across social media, our own stores and digital sites and wholesale environments. We also focused more than ever on creating innovative digital experiences that immerse the consumer in the world of Ralph Lauren. These included our groundbreaking virtual flagship store experiences in Beverly Hills, New York and Paris, where consumers around the world can experience our brands in the full breadth of our assortment in a way that was previously only possible by walking into one of our beautiful stores. Amplifying the reach of our flagships to a global audience, digital traffic in these virtual stores was 8x greater than the foot traffic in these physical stores over the same period.  We were also the first apparel brand to launch Snapchat's logo scan this holiday. This allows consumers to scan our iconic Polo Pony logo from any surface, including holding items, ads, shopping bags and more. To trigger an augmented reality experience, that brings them into the world of Ralph Lauren and ultimately transact on our own site. And in Asia, we were excited to launch our livestream selling event with 360-degree activation for Singles' Day, delivering more than 120 million impressions.  We're investing in these new forms of selling, including social commerce, which we expect to become a greater part of the digital shopping experience long term.  Looking ahead, we will continue to partner with celebrities and influencers who embody our core values along with being a part of key moments around the world. More recently, Ralph and I were particularly proud of our brand's participation in the U.S. Presidential inauguration.  Overall, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in consumer engagement across generations. Notably, our brand awareness and purchase intent have accelerated since the start of the pandemic and we are seeing particularly strong growth from consumers under 35 in women. We added more than 1 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone in Q3. And our total social media followers reached 45 million in the quarter. This was led by continued momentum across key platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, where our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection is connecting strongly with Gen Z consumers.  Since the launch last August, over 20 million users has addressed their Bitmoji and Ralph Lauren and tried on the collection over 550 million times. This takes me to our long-term priority of leading with digital.  Fiscal '21 continues to be a transformational year as we digitize our consumer platform and experiences and how we work as a company. On the consumer-facing side, the continued acceleration of connected retail is essential to creating the best possible experience for our consumers and to our long-term growth. Building on our accelerated connected retail launches in the first half of the year, in the third quarter, we added mobile point of sales across our North American retail fleet, appointment scheduling and curated personal collections online, all while continuing to expand our digital clienteling programs globally. We also launched our Hong Kong digital flagship in time for holiday, which is an important part of our broader ecosystem strategy as consumers shop and travel in new ways.  In addition to strengthening our digital commerce capabilities, we continue to build our social commerce presence and expand our partnerships with influential digital retailers around the world. Our teams executed a successful global launch campaign this holiday with FARFETCH. We delivered lifestyle content tailored to next-generation consumers, reaching over 15 million impressions globally, including the first ever editorial experience within the FARFETCH app.  We were encouraged by engagement rates that were 3x higher than our competitive benchmark on this platform. And as we continue to digitize how we work as a company, we launched our integrated vendor management system in the third quarter with the majority of our suppliers.  This new digitally centralized portal enables us to communicate seamlessly with our suppliers on everything from digital product creation to real-time tracking on our production status and factory capacity. It also enables us to track and support areas like gender diversity at the supplier level. This is all part of our broader goal of elevating our product, streamlining how we bring them to market and making it easier for our teams to stay connected and agile, all while driving our sustainability and citizenship initiatives across everything we do.  Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our ongoing focus on balancing growth with productivity continues to be an important element of our long-term plan. And this discipline is even more critical as we make hard choices to realign our cost structure so we can position the company to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it and pivot back to growth. In the second quarter, we announced the first major actions related to our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan. These included : first, the simplification of our organization, enabling our teams to move with greater agility; and second, an assessment of our brand portfolio, resulting in the decision to move Chaps to a fully licensed business. Today, we announce the next stage of our plan, which is focused on realigning and driving increased efficiencies across our global real estate footprint. While Jane will discuss these actions in more detail in a moment, I am pleased that we are making good progress on this multi-pronged plan.  This gives us increased confidence in our ability to start fiscal '22 strong and with the right foundations in place. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to touch on our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In the third quarter, we were proud to score 100% on the human rights campaign foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earn the designation as a best place to work for LGBTQ equality. On the supply chain and sustainability front, we have leveraged this period of change to continue diversifying across geographies and strengthening our relationships with suppliers.  From improved capacity planning to implementing diversity and inclusion training and driving best practices in sustainability. In the third quarter, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving our science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets and joined hundreds of other organizations in calling on the U.S. Federal government to reenter the Paris Climate Agreement, which the new administration recommitted to just a few weeks ago. We look forward to sharing further progress, including our greenhouse gas reduction road map in our 2021 report update this June. In closing, Ralph and I are optimistic about the future of our business and encouraged by the work our teams are doing to emerge from COVID stronger than we came into it. We are spending this time doing the important work of elevating our brand, investing in key strategic areas, streamlining our business and realigning our cost structure. We have made meaningful progress in delivering digital experiences for all of our consumers around the world and driving our direct-to-consumer channels, all while pursuing our goal of becoming a more equitable, diverse and sustainable company.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate solid execution of our strategy through this holiday season in the midst of a still challenging operating environment. We continue to focus on what we can control in this dynamic context and on positioning the company to accelerate value creation as we emerge from the pandemic. This includes investing in our powerful lifestyle brands, our digital transformation and maintaining a strong balance sheet. While also realigning and streamlining our operational and expense structures. As Patrice mentioned, today, we announced the second round of actions related to our fiscal '21 strategic realignment plan. This stage focuses on realigning our real estate footprint to our future strategic priorities. This includes : first, reducing our North America corporate office footprint up to 30%, along with selected reductions in Europe and Asia, as our teams embrace new ways of working and we pivot resources to our key strategic priorities; second, closing up to 10 retail locations globally. Pending ongoing landlord negotiations. Combined with the successful lease renegotiations completed year-to-date, we expect these savings to drive improved profitability in our existing fleet, while we continue to expand our brand elevating ecosystems; and third, completing the consolidation of our North American distribution center operations to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability and deliver a better consumer experience. with faster average delivery times and an increased focus on connected retail.  Combined, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pretax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, inclusive of our previously announced organization savings. While we still expect the majority of the original $180 million to $200 million in organizational savings to flow through to the bottom line, we expect to reinvest the majority of our savings related to today's actions in our future growth. We will provide any additional updates to the plan as the actions are finalized.  Moving on to the third quarter performance. Third quarter revenues declined 18% following a 30% decline in the second quarter. Asia and North America both improved sequentially, while Europe was more significantly impacted by COVID and mandated closures and restrictions in the quarter. Global wholesale revenue declined 19%, and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 16%. Our digital business outperformed with sales up more than 20% to last year, including double-digit growth in all regions. And even more importantly, our digital operating margins continued to expand. With Q3 digital margins up 900 basis points to last year and accretive to our total company rate through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage.  Driving profitability in this business remains key, not only to our long-term margin accretion and shift to DTC, but also to our strategy of repositioning ralphlauren.com as our digital flagship or the best expression of our brand online. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.4% in the third quarter, up 320 basis points to last year.  Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Around 60 basis points of this quarter's gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID. With the remainder driven primarily by our continued global improvements in pricing and promotions. Third quarter AUR growth of 19% was above our expectations, with North America and Europe up double digits and Asia up high single digits. We continue to elevate our brands across every touch point, significantly reduced promotions and take targeted pricing increases. Our confidence in this strategy is reinforced by our continued improvement in full price penetration, larger baskets, and better-than-expected conversion, even as AUR growth has exceeded our expectations.  Operating expenses declined 11% to last year, driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we continue to work in new ways. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 13.3%, down 70 basis points to last year. Marketing in the third quarter decreased 3%. We shifted some investments into the fourth quarter of the year as store closures and in-store shopping restrictions increased due to rising COVID cases.  However, we accelerated select strategic marketing investments this holiday, focusing on higher-margin, new customer acquisition in North American digital and reactivation of in-person events in Asia. We expect fourth quarter marketing to increase about 50% to support our long-term brand-building activities and key events like Lunar New Year and the Australian Open. This elevated growth rate reflects both the timing shift from Q3 and lapping of last year's depressed marketing spend as COVID hit Asia, followed by Europe and North America.  Moving on to segment performance. Starting with North America. Revenue decreased 21% to last year. Retail comps declined 21%, driven by a 30% decline in bricks-and-mortar comps. While our own digital comps improved sequentially to 9%. Brick-and-mortar comps continue to be impacted by COVID-related traffic declines with third quarter traffic down 45% and foreign tourist sales down about 85%. However, we continue to drive our strategy of improving quality of sales, with our third quarter discount rate down nearly 400 basis points. AUR up mid-teens and conversion up more than 200 basis points in our brick-and-mortar channel.  Our digital commerce comps were up 9%, with total digital sales up 10% in the quarter. Underlying sales to domestic consumers grew high teens, while sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site wide promotions by 52 days compared to the prior year, as we continue to elevate our digital experience, driving AUR up 22% and gross margins up more than 800 basis points to last year in the channel.  While these deliberate reductions in promotional activity are a headwind to our digital comps in fiscal '21, we continue to invest more aggressively on new consumer acquisition during this transition period. Our accelerated investment in digital marketing generated a 27% increase in new customers during this competitive holiday quarter, exceeding our expectations.  Year-to-date, these new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Looking ahead, we are focused on retaining these new consumers and are encouraged thus far by repeat purchase rates. Stronger sales to domestic consumers this quarter were driven by our ongoing investments in connected retailing, like Buy Online-Pickup in store, new functionality like online exchanges and Klarna payment installments and expanded personalization and targeted marketing efforts. All of these initiatives helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than 130% to last year.  In North America wholesale, third quarter revenue declined 22% as we continue to manage our shipments carefully and realigned inventories to demand. Full price sales declined at a more moderate rate, driven by stronger trends in core replenishment, Polo men's, kids and home, while Lauren Women's remain challenged, consistent with the broader category. Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at the end of the third quarter, declining more than 30% at North America wholesale. Our sales to off-price were down meaningfully as planned as we continue to significantly reduce our penetration in this channel.  Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue declined 28% on a reported basis and 32% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 38%, with a 51% decline in our bricks-and-mortar store comps, partly offset by an acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 68%. Across Europe, our bricks-and-mortar businesses were significantly impacted by traffic headwinds, with some form of store closures or restrictions across 16 of our 17 markets in the region, ranging from curfews and weekend closures to full lockdown. Despite these pressures, our conversion improved and AUR increased 12% to last year, driven by our ongoing strategy to elevate our factory channel.  Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comp was driven by our new consumer acquisition, up 112%, along with expanded connected retailing initiatives gifting programs and improve digital content.  Europe wholesale revenues declined 22% in constant currency as we continued to limit shipments to reset our inventories to demand. COVID-related challenges at bricks-and-mortar wholesale were partially offset by stronger performance at our wholesale digital accounts, where sell-in and sell-out rates were both positive for the quarter. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency. Our Asian retail comps increased 3% with bricks-and-mortar stores up 1% and digital comps up 54%. We are encouraged that growth in the Chinese mainland is not only back to pre-COVID levels of more than 40% on a reported basis, but growing versus LLY.  Japan also returned to positive growth in the third quarter, with sales increasing high single digits on a reported basis following a second COVID wave in Q2. However, we continue to watch Japan closely as key areas like Tokyo and Osaka entered a state of emergency in January.  Overall momentum in our Asian digital businesses continued through the quarter, driven by strong performance across all key markets and channels, including our own sites and digital pure plays, where we added 4 new partners in the quarter.  Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $1.9 billion in cash and investments and $694 million in total debt at the end of last year's third quarter.  While we have managed our balance sheet carefully since the start of the pandemic to preserve liquidity, we are monitoring COVID conditions closely. And based on our current outlook, we are planning to reinstate our dividend in the first half of fiscal '22.  Net inventory declined 4% to last year, including a 2% decline in North America, 15% decline in Europe and a 7% increase in Asia to support growth. While we have taken a highly cautious approach to managing inventory through the pandemic, overall, we are encouraged by our team's ability to both move inventories across regions and to merchandise around our core and iconic styles, as well as key COVID categories like home, loungewear and casual tees. Our increased agility is also enabling us to drive core product replenishment and shift back into pre-COVID categories as consumers start returning to more normalized trends.  Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of current coved lockdowns and trends and is subject to change given the dynamic nature of COVID developments around the world. We currently expect fourth quarter revenues to decline approximately mid- to high single digits, representing a meaningful sequential improvement from the first three quarters of the year. This includes the impact of third wave COVID lockdowns in the U.K. and Germany from the start of the quarter through approximately mid-February as well as partial closures in France, Spain and Italy. Third wave lockdowns in Japan through early March and a slow recovery in North America, where we have also seen increased cases and COVID-related traffic headwinds. If government-mandated lockdowns or restrictions are extended from these periods or more severe restrictions are applied, this could negatively impact our current outlook. These COVID-related headwinds should be partially mitigated by continued momentum in China and our global digital businesses. We expect gross margins to continue expanding, albeit at a more moderate rate than the first three quarters of the year as we strategically repurpose full price product from last year's COVID shutdowns to our factory channels.  Improved pricing and promotions, including targeted consumer messaging should continue to be the most durable driver followed by geographic and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to increase low single digits as we reaccelerate our brand-building investments to support growth coming out of the pandemic, largely offset by our ongoing expense discipline.  Excluding marketing, operating expenses are expected to decline low single digits. We expect inventories to increase in the fourth quarter as we start building back into demand and lap last year's double-digit decline in response to COVID.  In closing, we are encouraged by the progress our teams have made over the first three quarters of the year. As we close out this fiscal year, we are focused on offense as we leverage all of the critical work our teams have done prior to and through the pandemic to position the company for quality, long-term growth. Led by Ralph's enduring vision to guide us through a still highly dynamic global environment, we are accelerating our core strategies, including first and foremost, elevating our brands, driving our company-wide digital transformation and targeting expansion in key geographies. All while adopting new ways of working and executing with discipline around our cost structures. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Alexandra Walvis : So my first question is on the strength of the brand. We're year into the pandemic now and you've clearly expanded digital capabilities, you've taken meaningful steps to reset distribution cost structure. But if we look at your most important asset, the Ralph Lauren brand, can you talk to what gives you confidence in your brand health now? And is this where you want it to be in order to support strong growth coming out of the pandemic?  And then my second question, relatedly is on how confident you are that we should see AUR growth in F '22 off the higher AUR base in a backdrop that may well be a little more promotional than during the pandemic? Patrice Louvet : Well, thank you for your question. I'll take the first part, and then Jane will cover your AUR question. So elevating our brand and attracting high-quality new consumers across all three regions, particularly in the U.S. Our top priorities, and listen, will continue to be top priorities as we come out of COVID.  The general message is we're making strong progress. A few points to kind of support that. First, our data shows that our brand has strengthened through the pandemic. Specifically, if you look at brand awareness and purchase intent, they're both up versus a year ago and continuing to progress quarter-on-quarter, with particularly encouraging progress among next-gen consumers and women.  The second point is that we are acquiring more customers on our digital sites. We've seen 38% growth in North America, 79% growth in Europe and more than tenfold growth in Asia in terms of new customers on our sites year-to-date. This is clearly on the back of the deliberate targeted marketing plans that we've put in place across the regions. And it's also worth noting that we're not just driving higher traffic to our digital businesses, but we're also seeing -- and I think you heard it in Jane's remarks, an increase in our full-price sales. So we're bringing in new consumers that are higher ticket and higher margin. And I think that bodes well for the future for us.  The third point is really around our social media presence, which continues to deepen and grow around the world, our followers reached a record high 45 million this quarter, and we're especially encouraged by our progress on key platforms like Instagram and TikTok, YouTube, Kakao On-Line in Asia, where, as you've likely seen, we've developed some pretty unique partnership, including our recent Bitmoji Snapchat partnership. We're also driving brand heat through product as you may have seen our recent street work collaboration with Clot, which is a brand founded by Edison Chen and Kevin Poon, based out of Hong Kong.  There's a lot of excitement around these products. They virtually vaporized as we put them up for access to consumers within a few seconds, they were sold out. And now you can add them at multiples of the retail price on types like StockX. So we've been happy with the response we've seen and the contribution to overall brand heat. All this, importantly, is enabled by our strong balance sheet. Jane just touched on that, which has allowed us to continue driving our strategic priorities, like brand elevation, like investing in marketing, and also reinstate our dividend in the coming quarters.  So together, if you put all these elements together, this gives us confidence that we're investing in the right places to elevate our brand and drive interest and heat particularly with the next-generation that we're specifically focused on. And then on your AUR question, I'll let Jane answer that. Jane Nielsen : Sure. So Alex, just we are confident in our AUR growth. Certainly, because it's led by brand elevation and that brand elevation is something that we focused on this year. And are committed to continuing. And just as I look in the near term, even into Q4, we're expecting AUR growth about comparable to what you saw in Q3. But even as we come out of the pandemic and looking forward into fiscal '22, while we're not guiding, we do expect to comp the underlying AUR growth. Now we know that there have been unusual mix benefits during COVID.  With many of our stores and outlet doors closed during the cove period that lifted AUR. We've tried to be clear about calling that out and the impacts of COVID to our best estimates were that in Q1, underlying AUR growth was about high single digits. And in Q2 and Q3, it was in the low to mid-teens. So that is what -- that's the basis on which we expect to comp. And what we really feel good about is the long-term guidance for AUR as we move forward, which is in the low to mid-single-digit range. Because our long-term drivers are still intact.  As I said, elevating our product, our marketing and shopping experiences, which we've been talking about this year, all focused on elevating our brand. That we have the capabilities and an increasing number of tools that have proved out as we drive personalization in terms of managing promotional levels, better promotional levels, more personalization, more targeted promotions that have been very favorable in terms of driving AUR. Strategic price increases. It's a muscle that I think we started in F-- in over a year ago, starting in our factory channel, and you can see that carries through today where we've seen sort of a mid-teens price increases in our outlet channels.  As we elevate that product, put more quality in, and that's been -- we feel that we have more to go on that journey. And then, of course, there will be post-COVID continued mix benefits. As structurally, our international businesses grow faster as we move to be a more DTC oriented company that will also drive overall AUR. And certainly, the work that we've done in digital on AUR will continue to pay dividends into the future. So we feel really good about our trajectory. Understanding there will be some optics coming out of COVID. But I think we've been clear on the base and where we go in the future. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Jane, if you could just clarify. Jane, could you clarify, you mentioned shifting to offense and starting to build inventory a little to be preparing to fill demand as stores start to refill here. But you did comment on continuing to elevate the brands and your AUR commentary reflects as well. You mentioned focusing on starting '22 strong. And since that's just a few weeks away for you. Can you speak to where we'll see the most important inflections in the recent P&L trends, as you transition through into the early part of 2022? And then we're starting to hear some commentary around the sector from management team's thoughts on when they think they can approach pre-pandemic metrics. And as we look at consensus for your company, the general assumption is that the combination of all the work you've done on quality of sales to boost margins, well over $2 of net EPS, you've added from the SG&A work you've done. Consensus still has that combination landing at earnings below 2019 levels in the second half of this calendar year, so September and December quarters. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that if you have visibility. So just help us a little bit because of the fiscal year-end that you have here in March? Jane Nielsen : Sure. So let's peel that apart. So starting with inventory. As we do look at while we're very clear that there is some near term disruption, which likely could last into our fiscal '22 from COVID. Our long-term optimism and especially in the second half of our fiscal year is high. And so as I think about what we're going to be overlapping, we expect that store comps will be meaningfully better as we move through the year.  And certainly, as we move through the fiscal year into the second half. And that's really contingent on the vaccine and some of the abatement in the virus, which we believe in. And so we do believe that store comp will continue to be a positive factor as we move through fiscal '22. Certainly, our wholesale businesses have not been immune to the factors of COVID. And I think that as we emerge from the crisis, you'll also see we've been very tight on our sell-in. And sell-in has been under sell-out. And so there are good inventory replenishment needs. In the wholesale channel, especially as like our own channels, they come out of COVID. We feel -- our inventories were down 30% in North American wholesale. They have been sequentially down in Europe. So we feel good about our position. They're ready for fresh product, which we feel will be able to fulfill and expect momentum coming out of there.  And of course, the investments that we're making in digital, as we look across our total digital business, we expect acceleration global with our total digital business in Q4. And certainly, as we finish the cleanup in North America, and you can see that domestic consumer up high teens this quarter, will be done with a lot of the daigou cleanup, and you'll start to see that acceleration coming into fiscal '22. Those are the key drivers that give us optimism in '22. We do feel comfortable about our savings estimate of 100 -- the majority of $180 million to $200 million that we announced in the first realignment plan flowing through to be an EPS driver. And with that, our additional savings that we announced today will be used to accelerate and restart all those drivers that I talked about on sales to make sure that we have the investment funds to continue our digital expansion, elevate our brand, focus on marketing, which you've seen us approach with optimism in the fourth quarter, the marketing be up 50%. Those are the drivers. The question is timing, but we do feel confident about, certainly in the back half of '22. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. On North America, Patrice, maybe what inning would you peg your strategic quality of sales actions in today? And then, Jane, on SG&A, how should we think about incremental cost savings going forward relative to today's announcement, should we think about incremental cost savings from here reinvested back into the business? And if so, how would you rank more offensive investments to drive top line from here? Patrice Louvet : Jane loves your baseball analogies. So listen, I think there are 2 streams to think about when we look at North America. The first stream of work is the hard resets that we are doing on off-price penetration, shutting down over 230 wholesale doors and the daigou customer on ralphlauren.com North America that Jane referred to. On that one, assuming the game ends in 9 innings and doesn't go over time, we're likely at inning #7 on those.  So we expect -- we probably need a quarter -- one more quarter, Q4, maybe a bit of Q1 to have that completed across these 3 areas. And then on the second stream, I'll be honest with you, I don't think the game ever ends on brand elevation in North America. I think we want to continuously elevate our product, elevate how we show up in marketing, elevate how we're distributed. And I think that's been part of the success of this brand historically, and that's something we will continue to drive.  So I probably have us on the first inning with a never-ending game for that work stream. Jane Nielsen : Just on the SG&A, Matt, what we feel good about is that our realignment plan is on track. We feel confident about the savings from the org restructure that will flow through fiscal '22, as we've said. And then as you think about real estate, as we called out in the announcement today, the benefits of real estate will start to be realized as we move through fiscal '22. So all of those benefits won't be realized in fiscal '22, but we'll start to realize them in fiscal '22. And that -- and we will use those savings to drive important investments in our business. Like digital, like the work that we've been doing in personalization, which you've seen drive tremendous growth in Europe and is starting to bear fruit in our domestic business in North America. Certainly, investment in China, where this year alone, we've opened 85 stores. We intend to grow stores -- new stores.  We intend to continue that journey as we move forward. We believe we have distribution opportunities in Asia and also more targeted distribution opportunities in Europe and North America, and we will use the savings for that as well as increased marketing. We know that our brand and the elevation of the brand is so much of what is pulling the whole ecosystem up. So continuation of increased marketing across our brand. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Just how you're thinking about the range of top line outcomes in F '22, maybe relative to the pre pandemic period? And what sort of flexibility do you have in the P&L if top line is slower to recover just as I hear you talk about some of these expense initiatives. Just wondering how much you can flex those if need be as you think about F '22? And then just curious if you can share anything about what you see in the European digital business when stores close relative to how that digital business performs when stores are open? Jane Nielsen : Sure. So Paul, you -- what we have seen -- let me start with the second part of your question, and then I will go to flexibility and inflection in FY '22. So what we have seen in our Europe business specifically is that when the stores close, we do see an inflection in our digital business. Although it's not a one-for-one offset. So you can just see by this quarter with the shutdowns in our store in Europe in November and then into December, that suppress the total -- the total Europe growth, but we did see an acceleration in digital and high-quality digital growth. So we were very pleased with our reduction of discount rate in Europe and the very strong growth that we reported in digital in Europe.  As I think about the volatility as we move into fiscal '22, I think you're right, it's predicated on COVID and the rollout of the vaccine. And I think what you've seen us in the past is moving with agility. And as we look at our expense structure, we've been able to reinvest in the business as we are in the fourth quarter. Elevate marketing, but do so on a timed basis and investing into high ROIC categories. And I think that, that gives us protection on the downside and protects our profitability as we are very focused on the return of that marketing.  We will also have more pricing flexibility as we move forward, should there be volatility in the top line. And those are the primary factors that we'll look at as we move forward and understand the variability and volatility. Also, just a shout out to our supply chain who, given the high variability of demand and inventory planning has been able to replenish and shift by category across our broad range of categories, and that's given us the capability to meet demand even though it's been highly variable based on COVID. So that gives us a lot of confidence as well. Patrice Louvet : And Paul, the one element I would add on the European digital commerce performance, to Jane's point, is the fantastic work our teams in the markets have done relative to connected retail capabilities. I think pretty soon, we won't be talking about digital and brick-and-mortar separately because they're now so intertwined. But as you look at these new ways of selling in the context of connected retail, we're expecting that to be an accelerator for our digital performance.  And so a lot of that's been pioneered in Europe. A lot of that is what you see in these very strong numbers this quarter, where we're up 60 -- I believe 68% digital commerce in Europe. And I think that is a sustainable set of capabilities that will help us continue to accelerate progress on that front. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : I guess, Jane, a question for you, similar to Matthew's question on kind of where the earnings base shakes out over time. I guess I wanted to focus really on the U.S. wholesale channel. So I believe pre-COVID, you were kind of doing $1.5 billion of U.S. wholesale. You've got initiatives in place to shrink the door count and does it rationalize some of the lower margin revenue streams you had there?  I guess when all is said and done, and we're on the other side of this, how much of a smaller wholesale business do you expect to be managing, if at all?  And then how does that kind of translate into operating margins? Are you planning a smaller, more profitable channel? Are you kind of trying to get back to where you were? Just kind of curious at a high level how you think about it? Jane Nielsen : Yes. So just Ike, as we step back, I really believe that we should look at wholesale in 3 buckets. Obviously, this year, we announced a significant cleanup in North America wholesale, where we exited about 230 doors in North America, wholesale, will be through that. So good foundation, clean foundation. And moving from there, we know and we see we have share opportunities in the doors we are in. And so continued momentum from share. Even this quarter, we saw share gains in Men's, in Kids and Home in the wholesale channel.  So with that reset base, there's no reason that we -- and we are focused on comp growth in North America wholesale. And the Wholesale Dot Com is an area of wholesale that we're very optimistic about. And so we expect to grow wholesale in their digital -- in the digital business. And then we've been clear that off-price, and especially this quarter, off-price was down meaningfully. Our full-price wholesale on a sell-in basis and sell-out basis were -- in a sell-in basis was much better than what we reported in aggregate for North America wholesale. I expect the off-price cleanout as we exit Q4, to be about done, and it will be repositioned to what it should be, which is a channel that we can liquidate excess in. And so that pressure that you're seeing from off-price will abate in fiscal '22.  So we feel good about the foundation of where we'll be in wholesale. It will be a smaller channel. As you know, we announced the change of Chaps to licensing. Chaps is almost a completely wholesale business in North America. And so you'll see that part shrink the wholesale base. But we feel confident about the value creation of that change. And we feel good about the positions that we're in and how we move forward and focus on growing share in that channel and maximizing pure plays in digital. Operator : Our final question comes from Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Simeon Siegel : Jane, sorry if I missed it, could you drill down on the 900 basis points of own digital operating margin improvement? I mean, that's really impressive for a generally variable expense business. So maybe how much of that is gross margin, AUR or just how should we think about where the improvement came from and where we go from here? Jane Nielsen : Yes. Sure. So the primary driver of our digital margin reset was our pricing and product mix strategy. So we are elevating the mix, our product mix on our digital sites. We are pulling away from -- especially in North America from those daigou discount-oriented customers. We're recruiting new customers at a higher gross margin, a bigger basket. And so that's driving a great deal of our margin expansion as well. It's primarily coming from those resets, pricing, quality consumer recruitment. And we are getting some leverage on our fixed cost base, which is well built out. And is ready to be leveraged from a growth standpoint. So we feel good about, it has multiple drivers across all the vectors. And the most work has been on the North America site. That's where we've seen the biggest ladder up in this quarter in terms of digital margins, but tremendous progress in Europe over the past over the past six quarters. And Asia, with the reboot of Asia, started off with quite healthy margins and continues to grow those margins largely on scale. Patrice Louvet : And Simeon, I would add from a key deliverable for us this past year, we really were very focused on step changing profitability of digital. Because there's no interest in driving digital, or frankly, if it's going to be completely dilutive to your overall business. And we know it is the channel of the future. So as a team, we really focused on not just improving by 10 basis points, but the step change that you saw here, which is not a one-timer, this is sustainable because we're now getting to a point where our own digital operations are accretive to our overall company margins. And therefore, we have every incentive to follow the consumer who wants to actually shop on that channel. So excited about the progress and expect this to be sustained for us moving forward. Jane Nielsen : I love the new consumer metrics and the new consumers that we're recruiting. We're really excited about that as an investment opportunity for us. And just to -- I know I mentioned it on the script, but we're really proud that full price billing on our site up over 130%. Patrice Louvet : Good. So that's a good place to mark and close. Thank you, Simeon. So thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '21 results with you in May. And in the meantime, please stay safe, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

And now, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As we close out this fiscal year, Ralph and I are proud and inspired by the way our teams have navigated through the pandemic. They have demonstrated their resilience, agility, and ongoing passion for our brand and our consumers in a year unlike any other. Their commitment and execution shine through in our better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Against the volatile backdrop of the past year, we took action that has enabled us to emerge from this period a fundamentally stronger company, than when we came into it. This includes first, across all three regions, we accelerated our work to elevate our brands while also strengthening and simplifying our brand portfolio. We're also engaging more meaningfully with consumers and driving increased marketing to deliver higher brand awareness and purchase intent coupled with higher AURs. Second, we re-positioned each of our channels and reduced our exposure to secularly challenge areas of distribution, particularly in North America. Within wholesale, we focused our brick-and-mortar presence on our healthier stores and significantly reduced our off-price penetration. Within direct-to-consumer, we accelerated our shift to digital, step changing profitability by over 1,000 basis points, as we added new connected retail capabilities and drove quality of sales. Third, we established a stronger, digital infrastructure globally, while also ramping up our investments in consumer analytics, personalization, and high value new customer acquisition. Fourth, within our supply chain, we further diversified across geographies and meaningfully shortened lead times. With approximately two-thirds of our products now in lead times of six months or less, two years ahead of our goal to reach 50% and compared to just 20% five years ago. And lastly, we created a leaner, more agile cost structure. This operating discipline is enabling us to accelerate growth investments across areas like marketing, digital, and our key city ecosystems with further expansion in select underpenetrated markets this year. Overall, these actions position our business for healthier, more sustainable growth as we emerge from COVID. And beyond the foundational work we delivered this year, we strongly believe our brand is uniquely positioned to capture share both during this transitional post-pandemic period and longer term. Ralph has created a lifestyle brand that is inclusive and marked by spirit of togetherness, optimism, and love. And we believe this is the kind of luxury that people are creating in this moment. The breadth of our lifestyle portfolio means we have the ability to continue meeting consumers desires through comfort and timely [indiscernible], while also delivering on their increasing appetite to reintegrate elevated dress your styles back into their wardrobes. Over the coming quarters, you will see us progressively evolve our assortments accordingly. Before I speak to our growth drivers, I want to share a few of the highlights from our five strategic pillars this quarter and year. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. Some of our key campaigns this year included our Ralph Lauren Bitmoji Collection on Snapchat with over 1 billion try-ons to date. Our first of its kind Virtual Store Experiences, which now includes five of our iconic flagships globally, our Spring '21 Collection featuring a live performance from Janelle Monae, with over 36 million video views and more than 8 billion total impressions. Our limited edition Polo collaboration with Edison Chen's CLOT brand, ahead of the Lunar New Year, which sold out in less than two minutes on our WeChat Mini-Program in China, and with over 6 billion total impressions. And our debut sponsorship of the Australian Open, which resonated particularly well across Asia. And more still to come with our summer sports program, including the Tokyo Olympics starting in just over two months. In all, we added approximately 4 million new consumers through our direct-to-consumer platforms alone this past fiscal year. And our total social media followers exceeded 45 million led by Instagram, TikTok, Kakao, and Snapchat. This takes me to our priority of leading with digital. Fiscal 2021 was a transformational year in digitizing our consumer platforms and experiences, as well as how we work as a company. And we were proud to deliver significant acceleration in digital performance across each of our regions with total digital ecosystem growth of more than 60% this quarter. We accelerated the roll-out of connected retail programs to enable our consumers to interact with our brands in new and more personal venues. Among the many new capabilities we added this year, highlights included digital catalogs, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store and curbside pickup, mobile checkout, contactless payments, and Klarna payment installments. Connected Retail options now represent a high-single-digit percentage of our retail revenues in North America, and a high-teens percentage in Europe, up from low-single digits in both regions prior to COVID. We also continued to roll out digital flagships in Japan and Hong Kong, while adding new partnerships with influential digital partners around the world like Farfetch. In the fourth quarter, we also rolled out digital ID tagging to 50% of our total products and are on track to reach a 100% by end of fiscal 2022. These not only enable product authentication and support future circularity, but also provide consumers access to detailed product information. In addition to our consumer-facing enhancements, we made significant stride this year in digitizing how we work as a company. This includes the adoption of virtual showrooms and continuing to expand our 3D digital product creation. Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth, we accelerated key actions this year to realign our cost structure, many of which I outlined at the outset of our call. The third and final stage of our fiscal 2021 strategic realignment plan was our announcement last week to sell Club Monaco, expected to close in Q1. This sale combined with our previously announced action on shifting Chaps to a licensed model will enable us to further focus our resources on our core namesake brands. Club Monaco has been an important parts of Ralph Lauren for over two decades now. We are proud of the brand's evolution over that time, thanks to the passion and dedication of its talented, experienced, and engaged global team. We believe that this is the right step forward for the brand, and we are confident in the brand's strong future under Regent\u2019s stewardship. With this step and the actions we've taken as part of our strategic realignment plan, we continue to progress on our brand elevation journey as we deliver Ralph's vision in today's dynamic environment creating values for all of our stakeholders in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Importantly, I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. Navigating a highly dynamic global retail environment in the midst of COVID-19, our first priority was to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, partners and communities. This year, we donated hundreds of thousands of PPE, the frontline workers, 3 million products to frontline workers and families indeed, doubling our initial commitment and $10 million in COVID-19 relief from the Ralph Lauren corporate foundation to support our employees. communities and charitable partners. We were also proud to be named once again one of Forbes 2021 America's Best Employers for Diversity, capping off an important and defining year of employee engagement, round tables and learning opportunities for our organization. Within sustainability, we launched our circularity strategy, as well as color on demand, the revolutionary platform aimed at delivering the world's first scalable zero waste water cotton dyeing system. We are open sourcing the first phase of the platform to the fashion industry. Our hope is that we will see broad industry adoption, so that together we can make progress in addressing one of our sectors biggest area of income. We look forward to sharing our comprehensive progress on our citizenship and sustainability journey in our 2021 Design the Change report this June. Looking to fiscal year 2002, though still volatile given ongoing COVID closures and global supply chain disruptions, we are optimistic on a more favorable operating environment ahead. Consistent with the five pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan, we expect top line growth over the next year to be driven by a combination of continuing to scale digital, which now represents more than 25% of our total sales; expanding our key city ecosystems, led by fast growing markets like China, in addition to our under-penetrated areas in North America and Europe; accelerating marketing investments, Including new consumer acquisition targeting and personalization; and continuing on our brand elevation journey more broadly across our distribution and product assortments, driving further AUR growth, coupled with unit growth. Furthermore, we have confidence in a new post-pandemic fashion cycle based on the strong full price performance of our Spring '21 Collections. Our consumers are starting to gravitate back to newness, color and the styles we are best known for, such as our Iconic mesh polos, blazers and denim. This trend comes on top of the continued momentum we are seeing in, fleece, tees, novelty sweaters and other casual styles that have resonated with the past year. With our brand's unique ability to a short compelling products across Sportswear, loungewear and dressier styles, we will be consumer's growing demand across these categories in the coming season. In closing, Ralph and I want to reiterate how proud we are of the dedication, resilience and agility, our teams have demonstrated as we worked through a challenging year on many levels. We enter fiscal year 2022 stronger than we came into the crisis. With a stronger go-to market model, in more streamlined cost structure, more resilient supply chain and then iconic brand, well positioned to capitalize on the relax with sophisticated style consumers are craving. As we look ahead, we have significant opportunity, and a world-class team focused on becoming and even more elevated more direct-to-consumer, more digital, more global and more diverse equitable and sustainable company. And before I pass it to Jane, a couple of updates regarding our Board. Hubert Joly, will step into the role of Lead Independent Director, previously held by Frank Bennack, while Frank will continue to serve our Board. In addition, Ralph and I would like to extend our thanks to Joel Fleishman, who plans to retire from our Board of Directors this July for his leadership, significant contributions to the company and unflagging support and kindness. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane, to discuss our financial results. And I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. With the extraordinary efforts of our teams around the world, we closed out the year significantly stronger than we came into it, in terms of both our financial performance as well as our key strategic initiatives. Our fourth quarter and full year results reflected increased agility across our organization as macro conditions and consumer behaviors evolved. A significant leap forward on our elevation journey as we re-positioned our distribution and accelerated our pricing gains. Our digital transformation from how we serve our consumers to the way we work and driving digital margin accretion and a better aligned operational and expense structure overall. This year we delivered the highest gross margin in the company's history, even excluding the one-time mix benefits of COVID. Our underlying gross margin for fiscal 2021 was about 64.2%. We also strengthened our balance sheet through this year of uncertainty and are pleased to announce the reinstatement of our dividend in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. And as Patrice mentioned, we announced the final stage of our strategic realignment plan with the sale of Club Monaco contributing about 40 basis points to 50 basis points to operating margins this year. These actions step the right foundation and strategic focus for our teams as we enter fiscal 2022. Moving on to our fourth quarter performance. Our business returned to growth in the fourth quarter. Total revenues increased 1% compared to an 18% decline in the third quarter. All regions improved sequentially with positive growth in Asia and Europe on a reported basis, despite continued COVID-related disruptions. North America also returned to positive comps this quarter driven by significant digital acceleration. Global wholesale revenues increased 1% and direct-to-consumer revenues were up 4%. Total digital ecosystem sales accelerated to more than 60% with double-digit growth in every region up from mid-single digits in the first nine months of the year. And we delivered digital margins that were accretive within every region and to our total company rate expanding more than a 1,000 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year. We achieved this outstanding result through a combination of higher quality of sales and operating expense leverage. This was an important step as we work toward our mid-teens company operating margin target and continue to drive digital expansion in the years to come. Total company adjusted gross margin was 62.9% in the fourth quarter, up 380 basis points to last year. Gross margin expansion was primarily driven by strong AUR growth, along with favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. Product costs were also lower as we lapped last year's tariff impacts in North America, partially offset by higher freight costs this year. Around 80 basis points of fourth quarter and 150 basis points of full year gross margin expansion was driven by unusual mix shifts due to COVID. Fourth quarter AUR growth of 30% represented our 16th consecutive quarter of AUR gains, as we continue on our brand elevation journey. Underlying AUR growth of about 20% was driven by a combination of reduced promotional activity, improved full price selling on our new Spring Collections and strategic price increases. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our long-term target of low to mid-single digit AUR growth supported by the same multi-pronged strategy of product elevation, acquisition of new full-priced consumers and favorable channel and geographic mix, while also ramping up our targeting and personalization efforts. Operating expenses declined 4% to last year driven by reductions in compensation, rent and other expenses as we started to realize the early benefits of our fiscal 2021 restructuring. Adjusted operating margins for the fourth quarter was 3.4%, up 680 basis points to last year. Marketing in the fourth quarter accelerated to 44% growth as we reactivated in-person activities continue to drive high impact digital campaigns and personalization and shifted certain investments from the first three quarters of the year due to COVID lockdowns. For the full year, marketing increased to 6% of sales, up from 4.5% the prior year. With sales growth expected to accelerate in fiscal 2022, we expect marketing to remain at an elevated level to support our long-term brand building, digital activations and key events like the Olympics, US Open and Wimbledon. Moving on to segment performance. Starting with North America. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 10% to last year, but continued to improve on a sequential basis, including an earlier than expected return to positive retail comps, up 3%. Comps in our owned digital commerce business were up 25% this quarter, accelerating from 9% in Q3. Underlying sales to domestic consumers accelerated to over 50% up from high teens in Q3, while the sales to international daigou consumers declined double digits to last year as planned. We reduced our site-wide promotions by 50 days compared to the prior year, as we continue to elevate our digital experience driving AUR up more than 40% and gross margins up more than 700 basis points to last year in the channel. At the same time, we continue to invest in new consumer acquisition, up 78% in the fourth quarter and 45% for the full year. These new consumers are transacting at higher gross margin rates and larger basket sizes, and represent a higher penetration of consumers under 35. Stronger sales of new Spring '21 product offering along with continued investments in Connected Retailing helped deliver a significant increase in our full-price sales this quarter, which grew more than a 150% to last year. Brick-and-mortar comps improved sequentially to down 2% in the quarter with meaningful improvements in AUR, basket size and conversion. Traffic was down 23%, but in selected to positive growth in the last three weeks of March, as we started to lap COVID shutdowns, while foreign tourist sales were down about 75%. In North America wholesale, fourth quarter revenue declined 22%, as we continue to manage our sell-in carefully through the Spring season. However, we were encouraged by positive sell-out performance along with double-digit AUR increases to both last year and LLY. Our inventories in the marketplace were clean and well positioned at year-end declining nearly 30% at North America wholesale. And we expect a meaningful turnaround in our sell-in trends as we enter Q1. Our sales to off-price were down double-digits as planned, reducing our penetration to the channel by about 450 basis points for the full year. Overall, we completed our distribution reset plans in North America this year across digital, department stores and off-price, enabling us to enter fiscal 2022 with a healthier, more elevated brand positioning. We ended fiscal 2021 with North America brick-and-mortar full price wholesale penetration at about 10% of total company revenues, down from mid-teens last year, as we continue to accelerate our wholesale.com, direct-to- consumer and international expansion. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in our direct-to-consumer comps, including digital acceleration and quality wholesale improvement. Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 5% on a reported basis, and was down 4% in constant currency. Europe retail comps were down 45% with 65% decline in brick-and-mortar stores, partially offset by continued acceleration in our own digital commerce, up 79%. More than half our stores were fully closed in the quarter, similar to last spring. Nevertheless, we were able to drive significantly better performance compared to our Q1 lockdown as strong momentum across digital help to offset brick-and-mortar headwinds. About 80% of our stores in the region are now fully open versus a little over 50% at the end of Q4. Strong momentum in our own digital commerce comps was driven by new consumer acquisition and personalization, up 75%. Europe wholesale revenue increased 29% in constant currency. COVID-related challenges, a brick-and-mortar wholesale were more than offset by stronger performance in our wholesale digital account. This quarter's wholesale performance significantly exceeded our expectations, despite ongoing COVID headwinds underscoring both the strength of our partnerships as well as our successful pivot to digital in the market. And while COVID restrictions continue to pressure, many of our key European markets into fiscal 2022, we are encouraged that the UK, our largest market in the region emerge from lockdowns in mid-April and is showing early signs of pent-up demand. Underlying macro indicators are also encouraging with an improving pace of vaccination roll-out, high levels of consumer savings and consumer purchases shifting back toward our pre-COVID categories this spring. Turning to Asia; revenue increased 35% on a reported basis, and 28% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Our Asian retail comps increased 23% with brick-and-mortar stores up 21%, and digital up, 59%. All of our key markets reported positive growth led by the Chinese mainland, which was up 145% in constant currency and more than 70% to LLY. Korea also accelerated to 50% growth. Japan, our largest market in the region grew mid-single digits, despite COVID restrictions in the first half of the quarter. We are encouraged that our digital businesses continue to accelerate even as brick-and-mortar trends have strengthened. This was supported by a successful Lunar New Year campaign with sales up 75% to LLY. Strong momentum in our newer digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong and powerful partnerships like a cow in Tmall's Luxury Pavilion, where we became the number one menswear brand this quarter. Looking ahead, we are watching Japan carefully, due to a new state of emergency imposed in April, which is included in our Q1 guidance. Nevertheless, we are encouraged that the rest of our key markets in Asia have returned to a more normalized growth trajectory. And we still see significant long-term growth opportunities in the region and particularly in China, which now represents about 6% of total company revenues nearly double the penetration from a year ago. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $2.8 billion in cash and investments, and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.2 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 3% to support future growth compared to depressed levels of down 10% at the end of last year as COVID hit. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, which includes ongoing COVID-related disruptions to the global supply chain, as well as key markets still operating under government restrictions, primarily in Europe and Japan. For fiscal 2022, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 20% to 25% to last year on a 52-week comparable basis. We expect double-digit growth in each region led by Europe and North America, due to the significant COVID-related closures in the prior year. We estimate the 53rd week will contribute an additional 140 basis points to this year's revenue growth. We expect gross margins to contract 40 basis points to 60 basis points as we lap last year's unusual geographic and channel mix benefits due to COVID closures. This implies about a 100 basis point expansion to last year's underlying gross margin ex-COVID. Gross margins should benefit from product mix, reduced costs following, organization reshaping, as well as further improvements in pricing. We expect these drivers to be offset by duties significantly higher freight costs and global supply chain pressures, notably in the first quarter and consistent with the broader industry. Overall, we are watching a highly volatile and inflationary input cost environment into fiscal 2022. SG&A should grow at a more moderate rate than revenues. Inflation along with continued investments in marketing, new stores and digital will be mitigated by continued expense discipline and restructuring savings. As a result, we expect operating margins of about 11%, expanding approximately 620 basis points to last year and exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. As previously discussed, we deliberately exited or reduced several areas of our business in fiscal 2021 to accelerate our brand elevation strategy. These include transitioning Chaps from an owned to a fully licensed model, exiting more than 200 US department store doors, significantly reducing our off-price business, and shrinking our exposure to international daigou sales on our ralphlauren.com site in North America. Combined with the sale of Club Monaco expected to close in the first quarter, these strategic actions represent a little more than $700 million in revenues compared to fiscal 2020. This implies expected fiscal 2022 revenues that are roughly flat to pre-pandemic levels on an underlying basis. For the first quarter, which still includes the operational results of Club Monaco, we expect revenues to increase approximately 140% to 150% in constant currency. We expect gross margins to decline approximately 575 basis points, as we lap last year's one-time COVID mix benefits due to store closures and from higher freight headwinds in the quarter. We expect operating margin of 7% to 7.5% with gross margin contraction more than offset by significant operating expense leverage. We expect to end fiscal 2022 with inventories up 12% with higher growth in the first half of the year, as we continue to build back into demand. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to $275 million in line with our pre-pandemic targets, as we continue to focus on building out our key city ecosystems and digital infrastructure. In closing, in the midst of an unprecedented year, our teams showed tremendous dedication and agility as we fundamentally strengthened our business. Led by Ralph's enduring vision, we are leveraging the time listeners and authenticity of our core brands, while taking on learnings to evolve with the changing needs of the consumer across our product, platforms and new ways of working. And while we are still navigating a highly dynamic environment, we are confident, we have the right foundation to drive sustainable growth over the coming year and beyond. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Omar Saad at Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my questions. So look during COVID, you guys have made some really fundamental changes to your distribution, cost structure, the organizational structure, pared back some brands. If we look out beyond the recovery year, which I'm sure you and many others in the space will enjoy accelerating sales, but can you talk about how your brands are positioned to win in the post-pandemic world over the next few years, longer term, and Patrice can you include a discussion of how you think about balancing brand health and probability -- profitability versus chasing sales, i.e., how important is it for Ralph Lauren to return to consistent growth again. Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Omar. Thank you for your question. So, listen we're not only  well positioned to benefit from new fashion cycle as we emerge from COVID and as consumers return to the category into the stores, but we've also really strengthened the foundations of our business and laid the groundwork over the past year for a sustainable multi-year growth trajectory of a healthier base. So to your point, yes, of course, the comps will look attractive for the coming 12 months, but because of the base period, but obviously our lens has been beyond that looking to the next three years to five years for the company. So, as part of the work, we've of course accelerated digital, you saw that in the numbers we just announced and established infrastructure for Connected Retail around the world, and that's going to have benefits on a long-term basis. But as I step back, I think there are really three key differentiators that I would highlight to underline how we see our competitive advantage and our long-term growth potential. The first one is the strength of our brand. And over the past year, we've actually seen our purchase intent increase across all of our key markets, which we track now on a monthly basis. And as you saw with our AUR numbers, we continue to progress on our elevation journey, up 30% this quarter, up 26% this fiscal year, 16 quarters in a row of AUR growth reflection of our brand elevation journey. The other point I would highlight is that we're seeing that our brand aesthetic that's anchored in luxury classics, right. So elevated flows that you can live in is resonating with consumers who are looking for a different kinds of luxury coming out of the pandemic. One important data point for us in this brand strength area is our ability to recruit new consumers. Over the past year, we've brought in more than 4 million new consumers into our franchise and these new consumers are generally younger, higher basket size, and higher profitability, and it's really only the beginning. I think we now have a consumer recruiting machine that's working very well across all of our key markets. So first area is really strength of our brand, Omar. Second area is the breadth of our lifestyle portfolio. And I think this enables us to flex across categories. The flex across different consumer interests and desires, whether that's athleisure, loungewear, or more sophisticated casual, and also expand into high potential underdeveloped categories like home or like outerwear. Third area is our resources and particularly our cash position. As you know and we've prided ourselves of that, we manage our balance sheet conservatively. And I think the past years indicated that, that was probably a good choice, and we are in a position now where one, we can restart dividends as you heard Jane mentioned earlier. And two, we have the fuel to invest in critical growth areas like digital, like marketing, and like store openings. So, we feel very good about where we are in terms of our ability to fund the investment opportunities for growth to your point. I think it's fair to say that our brand remains bigger than our business. And as we look at our opportunities around the world, both on the category, consumer segment and geographical standpoint, we have many vectors of growth, even more focus now on the Ralph Lauren namesake brands posts and moves that we've made on Chaps and recently announced on Club. So listen, on top of these three differentiators, which I think are evergreen and real point of difference for us, we have the benefit of an incredibly talented global organization, that's really proven its resilience and agility and scale during this crisis. We have a diversified and flexible supply chain. And I think the portfolio that's now well-defined and tight, so we can really focus on those key value drivers. So while we're not completely done with COVID, as you look at what's happening in Japan, what's happening in parts of Europe and other parts of Asia, I am incredibly encouraged by our positioning and by the foundations that we've laid for the short, the mid, and the long-term as we pivot back to offense not only this coming year, but for the years to come. To your question on quality of sales and general growth, listen we're in growth mode, right. We're in growth and value creation mode. We have a number of engines for growth. We will continue our brand elevation journey, which I think will be evergreen for this company. So, our expectation is to continue to drive AUR, obviously at a more modest pace than this past year. We continue to drive AUR. Our expectation is to continue to recruit new consumers, and we also expect to start to grow units, all right. And that's really the vectors of growth moving forward. So yes, Ralph Lauren is a growth company, value creation company, obviously, we will do it profitably as we've been doing, but we're excited about what's possible for us moving forward. Jane Nielsen : And Omar, I would just add that, your question about the balance between brand, health and profitability, I mean that's the core of our strategy. We believe elevation of our brand, elevation of our distribution drives improved profitability and value creation, and I think our guidance that we're back to growth and back to OI margin accretion relative to pre-COVID levels is a proof point in and that\u2019s what our strategy is going to deliver. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions here and all the detail today. Let me ask at a high level. North America has been a big focus for a while. How are you feeling about the North America business now? A lot of the initiatives that you mentioned that you were trying to clean up over the last year are focused in that market. So how are you feeling about the North America business now, your ability to grow sustainably in the core market? And maybe you could help us by touching on a few of the key elements driving the plan. And then my second question is on SG&A, as we look at the guidance for fiscal 2022. I'm trying to -- you've done a lot of work on that line, Jane. And if I'm trying to think if the revenues come in, in an upside scenario, where it is SG&A go, if revenues beat your plan to try -- we're trying to think about how the fixed versus floating in SG&A relative to what we know about this business pre-COVID? What's the flow through on upside revenues, if you could. Patrice Louvet : Sounds good. Well, good morning, Michael, and Jane and I will answer on your questions. Listen, big picture. I have the most confidence now in our ability to win in North America, since starting with the company close to four years ago. That's really the way I feel right now by looking at where we are, what we've done and the key drivers of growth and value creation for that region. We have significant growth opportunities across the entire region. We are under developed in many key cities across the US, particularly in the West and in the South. And we have significant opportunity to expand our direct-to-consumer Connected Retail footprint. So of course is going to be the easy compares versus in fiscal year 2022 versus this past fiscal year, but all of the long-term drivers that I talked about in response to Omar's question apply here as well in our home market, of course. As you mentioned, specific to North America, the past three years or four years has been a year of reset. It's been a year of clean up, to get to a healthy base, to be positioned for growth. And so most of that work is complete now. The vast majority of it is complete. The recent interventions on our brand portfolio kind of being the closing elements of it. And we are clearly pivoting to offense across North America, across channels. We see multiple vectors of growth going forward. So if I take them one by one, first of all, our own digital, all right, which you saw the numbers this past quarter, 25% in total. Our domestic customers up 50% versus year ago, as we haven't delivered these kind of numbers on our own digital. I think since we've really been tracking it. So we're excited about the progress we're making there. The numbers are starting to reflect the higher and more margin accretive underlying growth, now that the daigou cleanup is mostly done. And this is a reflection of product that's really resonating with the consumer connected retail capabilities that the consumer is taking advantage of better functionalities on the sites and a much more effective segmentation targeting and personalization. Second area is our own retail stores, right, where our business model, our brand elevation and our Connected Retailing initiatives are working. And you're seeing the progress in the past quarter. We're driving back to sustainable positive comps and AUR. We're encouraged to see that the brick-and-mortar trends are beginning to improve. And just one data point, but our March comps were up strong double digits to last year and on a two-year stack. And with only 44 price stores, when you and I have talked this, right, we still -- we see a significant opportunity to expand our key city strategy and actually our North America team is in the field now visiting a number of locations, as we speak, we're going to do it very selectively and with a strong focus on Connected Retail centered around the consumer. And then finally on wholesale, where we've made dramatic changes over the past few years. A couple of data points. Our wholesale presence is down in terms of doors is down 61% over the past three years to four years. Our off-price penetration is down 50% over the past three years to four years. So massive resets that are now complete and now we are seeing accelerating growth, accelerating penetration of wholesale.com, where we've got very good momentum and wonderful partnerships here in the US. And we're starting to grow share in our existing wholesale doors. Past quarter, we grew share in men's. We grew share in kids, we grew share in home, and we're seeing more recently our women's business start to respond as well. So we have a healthier -- we have healthier partnerships. We have a cleaner footprint from both a digital and brick-and-mortar standpoint in wholesale. And so net -- I'd say, Michael, I feel very good about where we are, and obviously we got to deliver. But I think we're very well positioned now to win in North America. Jane Nielsen : And just, Michael, on your question on SG&A. So, obviously our guidance implies significant SG&A leverage in this year. And that's really built on, it's over 600 -- well over 600 basis points and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points to pre-COVID levels. And that's really predicated on what we've done in terms of achieving savings from our organization restructuring, obviously what we've called out for Club Monaco. And as you think about upside scenarios, and I think we've guided based on our best visibility that we have today in a fairly dynamic environment. But as you think about revenue upside, as vaccination rates might accelerate worldwide, as tourism may come back, strong -- maintenance of high digital penetrations like we saw in China, those are all upside scenarios. Our strong gross margin is really going to help us with flow through there. In terms of our cost structure, I think about the big buckets of rent and occupancy, corporate costs, depreciation are all highly leverageable in our model. And so the flow through that we get on incremental sales either in wholesale, digital or in our own stores are accretive, and a nicely accretive. So, I think you will see flow through, if there is an upside scenario on sales as we typically do. But we feel very good about how our cost structure is positioned. We feel good about our ability to invest in our brands. So our guide also implies a continued higher level of marketing at that around 6% range, which is about 150 basis points higher than pre-COVID levels. We're committed to our brand elevation journey and see that marketing is a key part of that, plus digital investments and new store investments. We'll have about 50 gross new stores in this coming year, the environments, right. We're optimistic about the environment. This is the right time to go back to elevated distribution expansion. So we think we found the balance between delivering profit accretion and investing in our business. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. So, Patrice, maybe to dig a little further into the pivot to offence [ph] that you cited. Could you just maybe speak to some of the lead indicators in the business that you're seeing. Maybe we could just elaborate on the market share opportunity. I think you cited men's, kids and home, and then women's over time. Just what gives you confidence in those individual category. Patrice Louvet : Sure. In lead indicators that we look at that are, are we bringing in new consumers into the fold. And past quarter in North America, our digital platforms, new consumers of 79% versus year ago. We look at our ability continue to drive AUR, right. And you saw the strong performance. I think our strongest quarter of the fiscal year actually with AUR, up 30%. And as we look at -- as we track also brand health, so purchase intent key metrics of brand health, we continue to see progress. So those all give us confidence that the work we're doing is resonating, our product is resonating, our communication is resonating, our elevation of distribution is resonating. And then, through the specific share points, I mean you have access to this, to this data as well. We are seeing our share progress on -- quite strong on men's, renewed momentum on kids, which is a business that we've worked hard to energize and strong performance on home, which as you know is a new focus for us. And we think there's significant potential there. And then, indeed more recently, as the consumer behavior on women's ready to wear pivots back to more elevated products, pivot back to more fashion, more color, right. We're seeing women buy more into Princess dresses. We're seeing them buy more into Blazers. We're seeing them buy more into novelty sweaters. We're very well positioned in these categories. So we -- this is translating into accelerating performance for us. 30 [ph] days now, I hope to be able to report a lot more, once things are fully re-open in, into -- but at the end of this quarter we're feeling good about the momentum that we're building. Jane Nielsen : Well, that Patrice's comment is predicated on North America data. Based on our best estimates, we are also seeing share gains in Europe, in wholesale. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Jane, I think you mentioned that you took a little bit about $700 million in revenues out of the business, that on an underlying basis your revenues for fiscal year 2022 should be roughly flattish. Can you give us some sense of how we should think about that for 1Q or 1H, 2H? And then second question is, if I go back to the notes from last call you talked about the cost savings of around $180 million to $200 million at the -- majority of that should flow through the bottom line. Just curious if that's the right way to think about still where you guys -- are you going to lean into investments and how do we think about that versus 1H and 2H? Jane Nielsen : Sure. So Laurent, the $700 million is going to be a little more pronounced in the second half than in the first half, that's primarily driven by that we'll have Club Monaco in our results for Q1, and we'll have some residual Chaps business before the license shift in our business through Q1 and Q2. So you'll see a little bit of out-sized based on those two factors. The other, the daigou repositioning and wholesale door closures and off-price pullbacks those were relatively ratable through the year. But I think those two factors are what will distort 1H and 2H. And then on the $180 million of cost savings, about a $140 million is -- those savings are recorded in SG&A, because of our supply chain and product development organization streamlining about $40 million of that will be -- is embedded in COGS, and will flow through in COGS. And in terms of the year, it's also fairly ratable through the year. And we were encouraged in Q4, that we got an early start on that savings. The investment focus is that you point out are what I mentioned in terms of marketing versus pre-COVID levels, that 150 basis points increase in marketing. And then the store investments and digital investments, as you will see us invest as Patrice mentioned in more localized sites and some digital investments in content digitizing our supply chain. All of those are contemplated in our guidance. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks guys. I'm curious how you view of EBIT margins longer term might have changed as you kind of sit here today, just as you think about beyond '22. And relative to what you're guiding for this year. What do you need to see in the business to kind of achieve those goals, some top line number that you need to get to something else that needs to change within the P&L. And also just curious if you can give us a quick update on the order books for the fall in the wholesale business. Thanks. Jane Nielsen : Sure. So in terms of our operating margin guidance on a longer-term basis, what we see is that our mid-teens operating margin guidance over the next several years is still the right goal for us. Obviously, COVID put a question mark in terms of timing to achieve. But I think as we come out of this year, we're back on about 100 basis points of margin expansion from pre-COVID levels. Obviously we're expanding margins over 600 basis points to last year. That feels like a good trajectory and a balance of growth delivering operating margin profitability and investing in our business to make sure that it's a long-term value creating growth. And then, in terms of what we're seeing on what we have to see this year, obviously we've signaled a return to growth. We've signaled underlying gross margin expansion on the backs of AUR growth that's more in line with our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digits. We have to room maintain our operating expense discipline, while still investing in our business and making sure that those businesses yield the high ROI's that we've seen through this COVID period. We've got great results on ROI from personalization and targeting and marketing investments that really lean on our brands authenticity and heritage and value. So overall, I think we are feeling confident about our plan. Obviously, we're watching the trajectory of COVID carefully. It does imply a continued recovery rate in traffic. It does imply that the closures that we see in Europe will be completed in June. So that's a variable and we're watching disruptions in the supply chain fairly, carefully. In terms of fall orders, what we're seeing in Europe is, that Europe is up. You saw strong wholesale performance in Europe, that frankly exceeded our expectations given European closures. Europe is up on a versus last year of course, but also on a LLY basis. And in the US we're seeing strong improvement outperforming the broader wholesale trend and our sell-in is much better align now to sell-out. You saw over the past year we've been carefully managing inventories. We're now better aligned with positive sell-out in the fourth quarter and going forward we're seeing the order book better aligned to our sell-out trends, which were encouraged by. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Hey, good morning, everyone. So Jane, just to kind of go further on US wholesale, so bigger picture. I think the US wholesale business pre-COVID was around $1.5 billion. I know Chaps is coming out, so I think that's $200 million. But can you talk to us about ultimately how you see the sizing of that channel? Are you planning -- if there's any more detail on this year and how you're planning it that'd be great. But even multi-year is the business you're planning to kind of walk away from post-pandemic that maybe you just felt is not the most efficient, maybe it's lower margin. Just kind of trying to think about $1.5 billion pre-COVID maybe two years, three years from now, where ultimately do you kind of see that landing? Jane Nielsen : Of course. So what I feel really good about in North America, which Patrice commented on in his question is that we are essentially done with the repositioning that we needed to do across our broad wholesale channel. So wholesale of course is off-price, which we've significantly reshaped strategically and taken down materially. And we feel good about that business that is now strategically re-positioned to be what it should be, which is a vehicle for excess liquidation. We feel really good that we got out ahead of closing some of the 232 doors in North America. We feel like our store footprint is now elevated and appropriate to move forward. And you're starting to see us gain market share in the channel. And we feel good about the growth that you -- that we're seeing in wholesale.com. And view that as the continued source of growth for us as we move forward. You saw significant pick up in wholesale.com in North America and in Europe in the fourth quarter. So, we feel good about the Proofpoint [ph] and the trends on the back of some pilot initiatives, dedicated resourcing and dedicated content that we put there. So just for sizing, we feel like the North America will be a source of growth for us. It will also be a source of sustainable growth for us driven by digital, driven by pure plays and driven by market share gains in the district footprint, distribution footprint, which we now feel very good about. Corinna Van der Ghinst : We'll take one last question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Thanks for sneaking me in. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Go ahead. John Kernan : Hey, can you talk to EBIT level impacts from the shift in Chaps and then the sale of Club Monaco? Jane Nielsen : So the sale of Club Monaco, this year should add about 40 basis points to 50 basis points of operating margin, accretion. And then Chaps, while it has a meaningful hit on the bottom line is, will generate more dollars on the bottom line, but it's relatively small. Patrice Louvet : All right. Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today. We are very proud, Jane and I and Ralph of the resilience and agility, our teams have demonstrated in delivering a strong close to the year. Looking ahead, hopefully, you took this away from our conversation today, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth and value creation not only this fiscal year but also beyond. And we look forward to sharing our first quarter fiscal year 2022 results with you in August. Until then, stay safe and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As we close out this fiscal year, Ralph and I are proud and inspired by the way our teams have navigated through the pandemic. They have demonstrated their resilience, agility and ongoing passion for our brands and our consumers in a year unlike any other. Their commitment and execution shine through in our better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Against the volatile backdrop of the past year, we took action that has enabled us to emerge from this period a fundamentally stronger company than when we came into it. This includes; first, across all three regions, we accelerated our work to elevate our brands while also strengthening and simplifying our brand portfolio; we're also engaging more meaningfully with consumers and driving increased marketing to deliver higher brand awareness and purchase intent coupled with higher AURs; second, we repositioned each of our channels and reduced our exposure to secularly challenged areas of distribution, particularly in North America. Within wholesale, we focused our brick-and-mortar presence on our healthier stores and significantly reduced our off-price penetration. Within direct-to-consumer, we accelerated our shift to digital, step-changing profitability by over 1,000 basis points as we added new connected retail capabilities and drove quality of sales.

So apologies for the false start. And now we're ready to go into our prepared remarks. So good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our teams delivered exceptional first quarter performance on both our top and bottom line results and across every geography. Our brand is resonating with consumers around the world as we lean into the breadth of our offering to deliver the products they are craving in this new normal. And all of our regions are in a healthier, more profitable growth trajectory. Even as we continue to execute through COVID-related challenges, it is clear that Ralph Lauren is back on offense. A few highlights to note. First, building on our consistent brand elevation work in direct-to-consumer business. We are now seeing accelerated demand and increased AUR in our wholesale channel. Second, our digital growth is accelerating following our pricing and promotional reset work last year, and our digital margins continue to be accretive across every region. And third, we continue to make strong progress toward our long-term target of mid-teens operating margins. We delivered the highest Q1 company operating margin since fiscal 2014, even as we more than doubled our marketing investment and continue to reinvest in key areas of growth like digital, key city ecosystem expansion and our consumer targeting and personalization. Our performance demonstrates consistent execution against the five strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our Next Great Chapter plan. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation, as we continue to invest in marketing, we are focused on new consumer acquisition and retention and both global and localized campaigns that capture consumers' optimism and desire to come together as we progressively emerge from the challenges of the past year. Some of our key campaigns in the first quarter included our summer of sports, which we kicked off with our Olympics campaign in North America as the official outfitter of Team USA. In June, we amplified our Wimbledon campaign with a diverse group of athletes, celebrities and influencers such as South Korean Superstar and Tottenham Forward, Son Heung-min; British pro-surfer, Lucy Campbell; and G2 eSports League of Legend Superstar, Rekkles. In the world of Golf, we celebrated our brand ambassador, Yuka Sasou's first major win at the US Women's Open Championship, and we were excited to welcome LPGA professional golfer, Andrea Lee, as the newest face of our women's golf brand. Combined, these summer sports campaigns generated more than 8 billion total impressions globally in the quarter. And there's still more to come in August and September with the 2021 Ryder Cup and the US Open Tennis Championships right here in New York. We also announced our launch this quarter as the official outfitter of G2 eSports, 1 of the world's premier professional esports organizations. We are proud of this first-of-its-kind partnership in fashion and gaming as we continue to drive new ways of reaching next-generation consumers in key channels where they engage. In all, we added more than 1 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer channels alone this quarter. And our total social media followers continue to grow, exceeding 46 million globally, led by Instagram. This takes me to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. As markets reopen around the world, consumers are shifting back to many of the key categories that drove our business prior to the pandemic, while we also continue to develop new and high-potential categories. While casual styles are still resonating, we're also seeing a progressive return to sophisticated casual. Given the breadth of our assortment, we have the unique ability to respond to consumer shifting appetite, reintegrating more elevated styles into our assortments as we scale back on stay-at-home categories. On the Men's side, we're seeing a resurgence in polo shirts, sports coats and trousers, denim, footwear and accessories for our core brands. In Women's, we're seeing improvements across dresses, elevated sweaters, novelty fleece, jackets and handbags. And we're also driving better performance in bottoms, including new fashion silhouettes like wide leg as well as new fabrications like Silk and Linen. We are rebuilding the penetration of these categories into Fall '21 and beyond as consumers make the transition back to the office and social activities. Our spring performance gives us increased confidence that we will have the right assortments to meet consumers' needs moving forward. Other product highlights from the quarter included our first of several special collections with Major League Baseball. These limited capsules celebrate the heritage of America's favorite past time and evoke Ralph's lifelong love of the sport. Launched in May across all of our channels, including social, digital, our stores and wholesale. The initial capsule generated over 5 billion media impressions, along with significantly higher spend compared to our average total consumer. Our Spring Polo shirt campaign included the launch of our Polo Color shop, fully made to order customized Polos and our updated Earth Polo in expanded colors. And we launched Polo Colonia Intense, an updated fragrance for a new generation and our new stir of eyewear collection, as we continue to elevate and innovate across our licensed categories as well. Moving on to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. With most of our key markets now fully reopened, we are back on offense this year, with the build-out of our brand elevating key city ecosystems around the world. This ecosystem approach ensures a consistently elevated experience across our digital, social and physical channels, both in our direct-to-consumer and wholesale networks. As part of this, in the first quarter, we opened 18 new stores and concessions in priority locations globally, mostly in Asia, and closed 11 locations. China continues to be a significant long-term growth opportunity and our ecosystem approach delivered strong growth again this quarter, with Mainland sales up more than 50%. We are opening two new emblematic store experiences this year in Beijing and Shanghai. With a smaller footprint than our existing flagships around the world, this new format offers consumers an elevated immersive brand experience at a significantly lower investment than our traditional flagships. Our Beijing store opened at the end of April in Sanlitun Mall, one of the top shopping locations in the country. In addition to featuring a Ralph's coffee, Sunlitun integrates innovative, smart retail and digital activations throughout the store in partnership with Tencent. This includes endless aisle technology, the virtual try-ons and in-store treasure hunt, using QR codes and customization stations, where consumers use our WeChat Mini Program to order customized products from their mobile phones. Though still early, the store has significantly outperformed our initial expectations, and we're excited to build on our presence in China with the opening of our emblematic Shanghai location in just a few weeks. Both stores will immerse consumers in the world of Ralph Lauren and will help further develop our ecosystems in these key markets, which already include our smaller format Polo boutiques, in fashions and digital presence across our own site and key partners such as Tmall. And as foreign tourism continues to be a headwind compared to fiscal 2020 levels, we have shifted more of our marketing, clienteling and merchandising to capture local shoppers and regional tourists, along with driving digital commerce. This takes me to our priority of leading with digital. Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, accelerated to more than 80% growth in the first quarter in constant currency, up from about 60% in Q4. While traffic is returning -- is starting to return to physical stores, the strength in digital is exceeding our expectations, driving a benefit to our overall operating margin mix. North America drove the biggest improvement this quarter, increasing more than 50% across both owned and wholesale digital channels. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia momentum continued with growth of more than 100% in each region in Q1, led by our wholesale digital and pure-play channels. Our investments in digital continue to focus on content creation for all of our platforms, enhanced digital capabilities to improve the user experience, and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve our consumers even more effectively. Touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. We continue to drive expense discipline in the first quarter in order to fund our long-term strategic investments in global expansion, digital, and brand building, while also working toward our target of mid-teens operating margins. We also successfully completed the sale of Club Monaco at the end of the first quarter as planned. And as previously announced, Chaps will transition from our North America wholesale business to a license model in Q2. These actions will enable us to further focus our resources on our core namesake brands and elevated positioning in the marketplace. I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. In June, we published our annual Design the Change report, outlining our updated commitments and actions to drive our impact and champion the lives touched by our business. While I encourage all of you to download the full report from our corporate website, I'll highlight a few important additions this year. We committed to comprising our global leadership team of at least 20% underrepresented race and ethnic groups by 2023. As part of our comprehensive circularity strategy, we set a target to use 100% recycled cotton in our products by 2025 and to launch additional resale and recycle opportunities for our consumers by 2022. We also announced a goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain by 2040, as we continue to work on reducing our carbon footprint throughout our value chain. And beginning this fiscal year, we will incorporate key ESG metrics into our executive compensation plans. In closing, Ralph and I are very encouraged by the strong start to the fiscal year. Our teams are executing with passion and continue to embrace the agility they demonstrated throughout the challenging and unpredictable last 18 months. While we will continue to monitor key macro challenges closely for the balance of the year, notably around inflation, supply chain disruptions, COVID resurgences, and the pace of traffic recovery. The actions we took to strengthen the foundations of our brand and our business last year are enabling us to deliver results even earlier than we expected. Looking beyond this period of unusual COVID compares, we are increasingly confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth. More than ever, led by Ralph's iconic vision, our teams are intensely focused on executing on our strategic plan, to continue to protect and elevate our brand, while realizing the significant growth opportunities that exist for our business in every market. With their passion, talent, and careful execution, Ralph and I are confident in our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations as our teams navigated challenges with agility, our brands connected with consumers, and our strategy drove high-quality growth. Upside performance this quarter was driven by faster recovery in both North America and Europe led by our wholesale channels, strong performance across Asia, despite extended COVID headwinds in Japan, accelerated digital growth with further digital margin expansion, and continued brand elevation with high teens AUR growth. And we continue to drive expense discipline across our business while investing in high ROI initiatives to drive operating margins significantly above our expectations. First quarter revenues increased 182% to last year on a reported basis and 176% in constant currency. Growth was positive in every region, led by North America. Compared to first quarter fiscal 2020 or revenues declined 4%. However, this includes approximately seven points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset to our distribution and to our Chaps business, which transitions to a license model this month. Total digital ecosystem sales accelerated to more than 80% growth in constant currency, both to last year and LLY, including 50% growth in our own digital business. Our performance improved sequentially in every region, reflecting our strong assortments, expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. North America delivered the strongest sequential improvement with digital ecosystem sales increasing more than 50%, up from low double digits last year. Digital margins also continue to strengthen and we're strongly accretive to every region's profitability. Total company adjusted gross margin was 69.8% in the first quarter, down 200 basis points to last year on a reported basis and down 260 basis points in constant currency. This was significantly better than expected as we lapped last year's unusual COVID mix benefits driven by better pricing and promotion, along with favorable product mix and the benefit of supply chain organization streamlining. Adjusted gross margins increased 30 basis points to LLY. First quarter AUR growth grew 17%, marking our 17th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on our brand elevation journey. This came on top of 25% growth last year, while stores were closed. Adjusted operating expenses increased 39%, driven by higher compensation and rent as we lapped last year's furloughs and store closures during COVID shutdowns. Adjusted expenses declined 2% compared to LLY. We more than doubled our first quarter marketing investments over the last year's substantially reduced levels at the start of the pandemic. Compared to first quarter fiscal 2020, marketing increased 39% as we focus on digital initiatives and reactivating key brand moments as markets reopened around the world. We expect to maintain an elevated level of marketing this year at around 6% of sales, to support consumer engagement, acquisition and our long-term brand-building initiatives. Adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 16.8%, compared to a margin loss of negative 35.7% last year and 460 basis points ahead of LLY operating margin. This was well above our guidance of 7% to 7.5% due to stronger-than-expected replenishment in our wholesale and digital channels, which generate highly accretive margins versus our total company rate. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. First quarter revenue increased 300% to last year, driven by strong spring assortments, improving consumer sentiment and expanded store reopenings, as we lapped the peak of store lockdowns last spring. Compared to LLY, North America revenues declined 8%, but included an 18% headwind from our strategic distribution resets and Chaps. In North America Retail, revenues grew 189% to last year. Comps increased 176% on improved traffic and nearly 40% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick-and-mortar comps increased 278%, driven by stronger AUR, basket sizes and traffic as most stores reopened. Although, foreign tourist sales improved significantly to last year, they were still nearly 70% below LLY due to continued softness in international traffic and travel. Comps in our own digital commerce business grew 51% this quarter, accelerating from 25% in Q4, as we continue to focus on new consumer acquisition, product elevation and enhancing the user experience. While we expect continued momentum in this channel, we note the prior year compares build sequentially after Q1. In North America Wholesale, revenues increased to $250 million compared to $23 million last year, as we carefully restocked into the channel and lapped last year's minimal shipment to customers during the shutdown. Sales meaningfully outperformed our expectations, driving the biggest upside to our guidance this quarter. The foundational work we completed through COVID to reset and elevate our inventories, exit lower-tier wholesale doors and significantly reduce our off-price penetration is starting to deliver strong early results across every key metric. In North America wholesale, full-price sell-out is exceeding our sell-in. Total sell-out was up high teens to LLY in Q1, led by market share gains in men's, kids, home and women's footwear. And we are also encouraged by early sequential improvements in women's ready-to-wear. Wholesale AUR growth continues to accelerate, up more than 20% to LLY. This represents our strongest wholesale pricing gains in the last 6 years. And our focus on wholesale.com is working with digital sell-out up more than 50% in Q1 and more than 75% to LLY. Coming out of the pandemic, our wholesale partnerships are stronger, healthier and more collaborative with a focus on marketing, improved digital capabilities and the right product assortment and an appropriate level of inventories as we build back into demand, and we see more to come as we are still in the early stages of driving our brand elevation strategy in this channel. Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenue increased 194% on a reported basis and 179% in constant currency, above our expectations. First quarter comps increased at 98% with a 154% increase in brick-and-mortar as stores reopened and a 23% increase in digital commerce. The strong early pent-up demand that started in the UK this April was followed by better-than-expected reopening trends across; France, Germany and Italy despite extended lockdowns in the quarter. Approximately 20% of our stores were fully closed in Q1 with additional stores operating under partial closures or other restrictions. All of our major markets reopened by the end of June. Digital commerce outperformed despite a challenging 44% comparison last year when COVID-related closures shifted more business online. While our digital comps partially benefited from extended lockdowns across Europe this quarter, the results also reflected stronger spring assortments, growth in connected retail and our targeted marketing efforts. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, driven by stronger sellout and reorders in both digital wholesale as well as traditional wholesale accounts. Turning to Asia. Revenues increased 68% on a reported basis and 61% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps increased 43%, driven by similar performance across our brick-and-mortar stores and digital commerce. Our digital ecosystem continued to accelerate in Asia. In Q1, this was supported by our successful 520 gifting campaign, 618 shopping event live streamed from our newly-opened Stanley Tune store, and momentum in our newest digital flagships in China, Japan and Hong Kong. Japan, our largest market in Asia was negatively impacted by an extended state of emergency for the majority of the quarter. These restrictions drove a roughly 6-point headwind to the region's overall growth in Q1. Despite this, our teams were able to successfully mitigate these headwinds with stronger performance across the rest of the region. This was led by the Chinese Mainland, which was up more than 50% to last year and 70% to LLY in constant currency, driven by a strong product assortment, localized marketing initiatives and new store openings. Korea was also up more than 30% to last year and 40% to LLY. Japan returned to normal operations in late June and started to ramp up vaccinations. However, the government declared another state of emergency in July ahead of the Olympic Games, and we expect a slower recovery in Japan this year. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in total debt last year. We are confident in our ability to meet our debt leverage requirements, ratio requirements in Q2 and eliminate capital allocation restrictions in our bank waiver. Net inventory increased 4% to support increasing demand. This compared to a 22% decline last year a 22% decline last year when we limited shipments to brick-and-mortar channels at the height of COVID shutdowns last spring. Supply chain challenges are increasing. The variability of inventory flows quarter-to-quarter. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, which includes ongoing COVID-related disruptions, the global supply chain challenge and the global supply chain challenges. We expect the quarter cadence this year to be volatile given dynamic conditions across our markets. This includes potentially uneven pace of recovery by region and channel as well as the timing of investments as markets reopen. For fiscal 2022, we now expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 25% to 30% to last year on a 53-week basis. Excluding approximately $700 million in annualized revenues, we deliberately reduced during the pandemic, including department store exits, off-price and dig reductions, Chaps and Club Monaco, this implies revenues up slightly to fiscal 2020. Foreign currency is expected to contribute about 30 basis points to full year revenue growth. We now expect gross margin to expand 50 to 70 basis points even as we lap meaningful geographic and channel mix benefits due to last year's COVID closures. This implies roughly 440 basis point increase to fiscal 2020. Our outlook includes slightly higher freight headwinds of approximately 100 to 120 basis points versus our previous expectation of about 100 basis points. However, this is more than offset by our expectation of stronger AUR growth of mid- to high single-digits above our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digits annually as we continue our long-term elevation work. We now expect operating margin of 12% to 12.5%, up from our 11% outlook previously. This compares to a 4. 8% operating margin last year and 10.3% in fiscal 2020. We expect operating margin for the remaining three quarters to moderate from Q1 levels based on increased marketing investments as planned to get to our target of 6% of sales this year, increased freight pressure in the back half of the year and our assumption that the higher margin wholesale replenishments that we saw in the first quarter does not continue as demand start to normalize. For the full year, we expect operating profit dollars to increase meaningfully compared to fiscal 2020 pre-COVID levels. For the second quarter, which no longer includes Club Monaco, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 20% to 22%. Foreign currency is expected to contribute about 50 basis points to revenue growth. We expect operating margin of about 13% to 14% in the second quarter. This includes gross margin of flat to up 20 basis points as we continue to drive AUR and product mix, largely offset by higher freight as we lap last year's COVID mix benefits. We also expect modest operating expense leverage and restructuring savings, partially offset by higher marketing and new stores. We expect full year tax rate to be about 24% with the second quarter tax rate about 24% to 25%. In closing, we are proud of our team's agility and execution around the world this quarter. As Patrice mentioned, we are still managing through a highly dynamic environment. We are firmly back on offense with this strong start to the year and this is only the beginning. Guided by Ralph's original vision and our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We are connecting with consumers in more exciting and innovative ways than ever before. Over the coming quarters and beyond, you'll continue to see us driving our targeted strategic investments in key growth opportunities in order to deliver value for all our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brooke Roach at Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Good morning and thank you for taking our question. Can you please elaborate on what drove the outperformance in Q1? And perhaps where you see the most upside or downside risk to your updated fiscal 2022 guidance from here? And Jane, as a follow-up, with the 12% to 12.5% operating margin outlook in your sites for the year, how are you thinking about the levers to achieve your mid-teen longer-term operating margin target? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Hey good morning Brooke. Thanks for your question to kick us off. So, first off, I actually really want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous execution and agility of our teams in the first quarter as we got back on offense as a company. I'd say the key drivers of this quarter's outperformance were, first, the stronger-than-expected recovery in North America and Europe, especially in wholesale, which, as you know, is accretive to overall margins. Just a couple of data points to illustrate that, our North America wholesale AUR was up more than 20%. Our sell-out \u2013 full price sellout was up in the high teens and our wholesale.com business was up more than 75% to LLY. All 3 of these numbers are versus LLY, which we think is the more relevant benchmark period. The reset work that we did to create a healthier foundation in wholesale over the past few quarters is really starting to play out nicely and in a brand-enhancing way. The second point, I would call out is the fact that we drove the right elevated product and brand messaging with consumers. Ralph and our design team have done a great job of creating assortments that are resonating with consumers. We've been really pleased with our ability to win in casual, while at the same time, winning in more sophisticated casual as the consumer pivots back into that direction. And the third point I'd call out is our pivot to digital and connected retail, which is really driving accelerated growth and margin accretion across our digital channels. So therefore, I'd say we are feeling confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward, driven by a structurally healthier base, an important pivot in North America wholesale and digital and investments back into our business. Jane Nielsen : And Brooke, I would just add that many of the risk factors that we highlighted at the start of the year did not materialize in this quarter. And there were not as much of a headwind as we originally anticipated. And on the second part of your question, based on the strong Q1 beat, we felt comfortable raising our full year guidance on strength in digital and improved gross margin outlook with higher AURs and our ability to flow through top line outperformance to operating margin. That being said, the global environment remains volatile and our guidance continues to incorporate a number of factors. First, it's clear that COVID isn't over, and we are watching the impact across our markets from both a demand recovery as well as from a supply chain perspective. And second, we expect to have increased inflationary pressures whether it's from freight, raw materials or labor to be a headwind as we move through the year. And lastly, while we're focused on strong growth trajectory in fiscal '22, we're very focused on long-term growth and sustainable value creation. And as Patrice mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in profitable growth. And as we look towards a mid-teens operating margin, which we still think is the right long-term outlook for our business. We would say that we will continue \u2013 we get to mid-teens margins based on continued revenue recovery, although lower than our original expectation of a $7 billion revenue mark in our original investment day, thanks to the foundational work that we did through COVID. But it will continue to be a story of expanded gross margin and SG&A expense leverage to the top line. And we can do this based on a -- the expectation of a low single-digit comp growth, we've noticed -- as we've noted earlier in prior quarters. We still feel confident about that. That's still our long-term goal, and we feel great about the progress we've made in this year in getting closer to that goal. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Mattew Boss : Great. Thanks and congrats on a really nice quarter again, guys. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Matt. Mattew Boss : So Patrice, 17% AUR growth is on top of 25% a year ago. Maybe by region or by category, where are you seeing the greatest upside relative to plan as maybe you had laid it out, as it relates to pricing power? And then, as we think moving forward, where do you see the greatest opportunity remaining as you continue down the brand elevation path? Patrice Louvet : So you're right. It's 17% this quarter. And just to frame it for everyone on the call, this is our 17th quarter of AUR growth, okay? Now we know our AUR growth over the past 12 to 18 months has been outsized and our long-term guidance on that is more low to mid-single digits. But we're really pleased with the progress that the team has made on continuing to elevate the brand and drive AUR growth concurrently. Matt, the biggest areas of progression. The one thing I would really call out is actually the progress on North America wholesale. Because we haven't grown AUR in wholesale in North America in the long, long time, years. And I think through the great partnership that we have with our wholesale players here in the market, as well as the brand elevation work, the work on products, the work on marketing, the work on presenting the brand in a more engaging way, it's translating into meaningful AUR growth. You think we quoted a number up over 20% versus LLY North America wholesale. And listen, this is not a one quarter pop. We are confident in our trajectory moving forward, working closely with our partners to continue to drive AUR in wholesale. The other area I would call out is actually North America, our own website, where we saw, again, very meaningful progression on AUR this quarter, I think, up north of 40%. So quite healthy. Again, we're not pricing. We're not elevating AUR in a vacuum. This is the outcome of brand elevation work. Again, elevating the product, elevating our marketing, elevating our presentation. And as a result, we have the ability to drive AUR through the four vectors that we've been talking historically together. One is, being much more targeted and surgical in our promotional activity. Two is, strategic price increases where we believe we can offer competitive value relative to our peer set. Three is, continuing to invest in product mix, and you see us invest in outerwear, in home, now and those products obviously carry much greater AUR levels. And then finally, channel and country mix. So that's some specificity. But all-in-all, Matt, we've actually grown AUR really nicely across the board, and we're really pleased with our performance across regions, across channels, which indicates again that the brand elevation work that we are doing is sticking and that the consumers see the value in what we have to offer. Jane Nielsen : Yes. And Matt, I would just add that, we are really at the start of this journey in North America and we see significant upside. As Patrice mentioned, the wholesale pricing is very encouraging. You saw strong AUR growth in North America. And I think we're really encouraged by the team's ability to add levers of pricing as we move forward. Notably, our new consumer acquisition with those new consumers transacting at higher AURs and bigger basket sizes is a really nice additional lever that we feel confident in and confident that we've proved out the ROI of investing in that new consumer acquisition. So we feel like there is more upside as we move forward. I think North America is encouraging, but also we're encouraged by the pricing that we put up in our more developed markets like Asia, which has led in terms of AUR levels, but continues to grow nicely as we continue our brand elevation journey. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks for all the details. First, I'll offer my congrats. I know you guys did a lot of hard work to clean up the business last year. We can see the results of it here. A couple for me. Jane, similar to Matt's question on the AUR. How do you think about the sustainability of gross margins here? It's above \u2013 the run rate is above what you thought about at the Analyst Day, a couple of years back. It's been just such a source of upside to both our numbers and your plan for so many quarters. And it doesn't sound like the underlying drivers are slowing down at all. So I'd love your thoughts there. And then I guess in the quarter, as you started to refill the North America wholesale channel and Patrice, I heard in your voice, you're very happy with that. The growth rate improved by about 100 basis points sequentially compared to fourth quarter. So good numbers by any standards. And I don't mean to tempt or sound greedy, but as we've watched some of the peers report here lately, I wonder if Ralph Lauren would have seen wholesale up even more. And the only reason I ask that is because you've been very measured about the pace of restocking that channel. And I wonder if you could try to dimensionalize for us, how you think about the September quarter and North America wholesale channel trend, the gap between selling and sell-through. Do you feel like you've held it back and that can continue to normalize, or how should we think about the continuation of the refill the wholesale channel in North America? Jane Nielsen : Sure, Michael. That's a -- you've got a power packed question there. But let me start on gross margin because I think we really step back from our gross margin journey, which we didn't start during COVID. It started four years ago. It's really been a couple of big things. It's the power of our brand, our belief in it and our investment in it and the belief that we should be elevating all touch points to the consumer. That's what's given us the durability of our pricing journey, and that's what's really allowed us to continue to expand gross margin. We still believe in that journey. Both this \u2013 we also see that we have stronger products than ever before at what our breadth of categories and our strength of both opening price points, which we've maintained during this pricing journey and elevated price points, which our consumers are telling us that they have a strong and strong demand for has been an important part of our product mix journey and gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive gross margin. We also see the durability of our tailwinds. Longer-term, we should continue to see geographic benefits and channel benefits as we lean into direct-to-consumer and lean into digital. Those are the things that underneath the covers are really driving our long-term gross margin journey, which we believe is durable for the next several years, maybe not at the pace that we've seen during COVID, certainly, but gross margin expansion. And you continue to see that in us taking up our guidance to now expanded margins for the balance of the year. And just a couple of comments on the wholesale channel. We're very pleased with what we saw in the wholesale trajectory this year. We've often -- we've said throughout COVID that our sell-out and sell-in would start to normalize, while sell-out exceeded sell-in this quarter, we expect that to normalize and be strong as we move through with our partners in recovery. We're very encouraged by the comp performance in our North America wholesale business, which was up double-digits. And we're very pleased by the strong pace of growth that we saw in our digital wholesale business. I think we're working more collaboratively and in greater partnership with our wholesale partners than ever before. Patrice Louvet : Yes. I'm sorry, I would just double down on that. I think we've been really pleased with the partnership with our partners here. Just a data point to give you the context of the reset work that we've done on wholesale brick-and-mortar North America over the past few years. We're down 66% in terms of wholesale doors over the past 4 years, right? So, we're seeing the benefit of that healthier brick-and-mortar base. And then we're also seeing the benefit of amazing partnership we have on the digital front where you saw significant acceleration of our Wholesale.com performance, and we expect that momentum to continue. And I think we are on the very same page when it comes to looking at assortment and continuing to elevate our assortment. Corey Van Der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Patrice Louvet : Good morning Erinn. Erinn Murphy : A couple for me. First, I was hoping you could share a little bit more about the category outperformance. You named a number of categories, including Polo shirt for men, kind of tailored bottom, wide leg bottoms for women. And just going back to your Investor Day, you talked about non-core categories as being $0.5 billion of incremental growth. Just with what you've seen on consumer behavior, has the complexion of the categories in the non-core area change? Just curious on how you're thinking about the growth there. And then I've got 1 follow-up. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So, I'll take that one. I'm sure your follow-up is for Jane. So, on men's, it's indeed a pivot towards newness and a pivot towards more elevated products. And so sports jackets, sports coats, polo shirts, trousers, denim, and footwear are the areas where we have over-delivered over the past quarter. On women's, we're seeing the same shift towards newness and more sophisticated elevated casual, dresses, novelty sweaters, jackets, and bottoms are the key areas, Erinn, for women's. And as far as our, we like to call in high potential categories as opposed to non-core, but because over time, they will become core for us. So, these areas that we called out like outerwear, denim footwear accessories, and we're adding home to that, we still believe in the potential of those categories. If anything on outerwear, I think the opportunity is probably bigger than we initially estimated three or four years back. And we're going to continue to invest in that heavily. You will see that in our fall assortment as an illustration of that. And then across these different categories, I think we feel good about the capabilities we're building, the development of the product, how we're activating from a marketing standpoint and really rethinking the way the product needs to show up from a distribution point. The most recent addition to that group is home. It's very early days on that journey, but we're very bullish on the opportunity and encouraged by the initial momentum we have on those. Erinn Murphy : Great. And then my follow-up is just on the tourist level, I think you talked about it being down 70% versus LLY. Can you just share kind of your outlook over the next 12 to 18 months? Are there any signs of life as Europe reopening there or even here in North America and just kind of how we should think about the rebound as we look forward? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Well, we -- Aaron, while we saw tourist sales improved slightly in North America, they're still down 69% to LLY, but we did see some improvement on a sequential basis, but international travel remain limited to most regions. Our assumption in fiscal 2022 is that we've assumed continued headwinds from tourist sales as we expect foreign travel to be under pressure through the fiscal year. Foreign tourism intends to be lagging indicator. But fortunately, we are focused on capturing more domestic travel opportunities coming out of the pandemic. And know we've noted our Sanlitun store, which is outperforming in tourist market like Beijing and local domestic travel to some of our flagships is that we're also leaning into. And we have a limited presence in travel retail and have anticipated that that will be slower to recovery as we move forward. And we're very focused on building our business with the Chinese consumer within China. And you've seen our Mainland China growth, continued strong store build-outs and really increased marketing, which we doubled this quarter to engage with that consumer before they start on their travel as the markets start to recover. But our expectation is that will happen after fiscal 2022. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks very much for taking my question. Another great quarter. I wanted to ask a quick follow-up on all the discussions around your wholesale partners and the improved more collaborative relationships you're having there. Do you have any thoughts on whether the legacy markdown support vendor model -- vendor markdown support model maybe on the decline and less relevant going forward? And then I also wanted to get you guys talk a little bit more about the e-comm acceleration with the younger consumers, update with those consumers, what role do they play in the new pricing, new found pricing power in the brand? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Certainly, as we look at our global wholesale footprint, we want to drive greater focus on more on just natural margin, right? And that's certainly where we're headed, and as we're seeing our improved AUR performance in North America, less reliance on promotional activity. I think that's the direction of travel. So that's certainly the intent and that's what we're working towards. With our partners in a win-win mindset so that we can expand our margins, and they can also expand theirs in a sustainable win. When it comes to recruiting new consumers on our e-commerce sites, if I understood your question correctly, Omar, I mean, actually, we're quite energized by the progress we're making in terms of new younger consumer recruiting on our site. It's the result of a combination of factors, right? One, our marketing investments are up significantly. Just as a reminder, marketing this year, 6% of revenue, two years ago, 4.5% of revenue, so a significant lift in marketing. And then we're playing a much broader palette of marketing activities, ranging from these above the line big brand campaigns around the polo shirt to our activities on sports, Olympics, Wimbledon, gaming, right? You saw that we signed a partnership with G2 and in particular, with the Rekkles, they're one of their superstars there because that's where the consumer is. And that we want to -- we're going to appeal to that younger consumer where he or she consumes media, where he or she engages and we're seeing gaming as an important component of that. And then we're continuing to inject product newness and surprise in our program. So Major League Baseball program, frankly, exceeded our expectations significantly what we've seen in Asia, and particularly in China, with the partnership that we did with Edison Chen and the Clot brand, also significant excitement and very strong reaction from consumers. So, we are going to continue to appeal to a new generation, right? That's 1 of our 5 core strategic pillars. We think through our increased marketing and our more targeted approach, we have the ability to do that, and I think the numbers would bear that out. To Jane's earlier point, what we like about the consumer beyond the fact that it's a new generation is higher basket size, more -- full price and therefore, a more profitable consumer for us. And then we also put a lot of attention and focus on retention, right? Because obviously, the name of the game is interested to bring them in is to make sure they stay in the family. And here, our ability to target them with much more personalized messaging through digital is proving to be a very effective tool for us. So a journey to be continued, but we're excited and encouraged by the momentum we have with that next-generation consumer. Jane Nielsen : Omar, I just wanted to add just on your comment about vendor allowance and the relevance. Full price selling takes vendor allowances off the table. And when I look at our progress this quarter, our full price sell out was up almost 150%. And it was up almost 20% on a LLY basis. That's the power that eliminates the need for vendor allowances. It's the power of our brand, and that's what we're committed to delivery. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lauren Bales with Exane BNP Paribas. Lauren Bales : Good morning. Congrats on great results. I just wanted to ask about the operating margin, Jane and Patrice. You just delivered nearly a 17% operating margin in 1Q. You're guiding for a 13% to 14% operating margin, which would imply 2H operating margins would be single digits. Jane, any considerations on the gross margin SG&A front? And then secondly, I think, Jane, I think you mentioned North America was down 8%, but on a 2-year stack, but then there were 18 points of headwind due to the strategic actions which suggest that North America on a core basis really did grow. Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, how do we think about North America growth on a 2-year stack basis for FY '22? Jane Nielsen : Well, we will have the headwinds of the reset that we did. So you're exactly right. North America was down 8%. If you consider the 3%. Yes. Patrice Louvet : Up 10%. Jane Nielsen : Up 10%. Is that right? Patrice Louvet : Yes, whole company up 3.5% without the resets, North Tercas specifically up 10%? Jane Nielsen : I apologize. So North America would be up 10 if you take out all of the resets in Q1, even though on a LLY basis, it was down 8%. We're guiding now to 12% to 12.5% operating margin. That's puts us 200 basis points ahead of pre-COVID levels on a lower revenue base. So we're feeling very good about our progress towards our mid-teens operating margin. We do note, as we move through the year that we had some exceptional replenishment opportunities in wholesale, both digitally, digital pure players and our wholesale partners, which comes through at a high incremental margin. And don't anticipate that level of replenishment as we move forward. And we note that some of the freight pressures and some of the raw material pressures will continue be a headwind in the balance of the year. You'll recall, Laurent, that we buy on long-term contracts, and so some of that long-term pricing starts to fade out as we move into higher price layers as we move through the year. And we've incorporated this into our guidance, but we've taken up our freight impact from 100 basis points to 120 basis points for the year. The key lever for the balance of the year is really top line momentum. Now we're watching a number of factors, COVID, the delta variant and the supply chain very carefully, but we're very encouraged. It's still early in the year. We feel confident. We feel like we're back on offense and -- but we have a clear-eyed view of where the risk is and the opportunities across channels and the opportunities across our brand. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Thank you. We\u2019ll take the last question please. Operator : Thank you. The last question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow : Hey thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats Patrice, Jane. Great job. I guess maybe, Jane, a question on margins. The digital commentary you guys are giving, you're not only seeing pretty meaningful revenue acceleration in that channel, especially in North America, but the profitability metrics are pretty impressive. But I think you talked about 1,400 basis points of margin improvement on a two-year basis. And I think you said that it's now accretive to the total company operating margin, which is implying its mid-teens or better. How does that change the algorithm to get you to the mid-teens margin, maybe even quicker than what you would have thought prior at the Analyst Day when you think about how digital is mixing and the margin drivers within that channel? Jane Nielsen : Yeah. So the digital reset is a key and powerful driver for us to get to our operating margin expansion even on a lower revenue base. So I just want to clarify, not only is it accretive to total company, right, but it's accretive to every region. And when you look at the operating margins of the region, they are meaningfully ahead because they don't have the overhead charges of our total company margin. So to have it be accretive in every region is even a higher bar than accretive to total company, and it's accretive in every region. We're very proud of that. That can be a lever that we can now lean into and have it be margin accretive. It's a critical strategic reset for us. And I think we'll only -- is only securing and building our confidence in our ability to get to mid-teens margins. So we are very encouraged by our continued expansion in digital margins this quarter. Patrice Louvet : All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our second quarter fiscal 2022 results with you in November and in the meantime, stay safe, and have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Question-and-Answer session. Instructions on how to ask a question will be given at that time. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Good morning. And thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 conference call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results. You should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Corrie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining today's call. We were delivering strong progress on our fiscal '22 plan with second quarter performance exceeding our expectations across all key financial and consumer engagement metrics. Our brand elevation strategy, which cuts across our product, marketing and distribution channels, is resonating with consumers in every region. We're driving these results despite greater-than-expected disruptions in the global supply chain and extended COVID restrictions in key markets like Japan.  And while we continue to face a volatile environment, the work we have done to build a resilient supply chain over the last several years, as well as our significant AUR elevation, will continue to be competitive advantages as we navigate emerging challenges, and mitigate risks. To give you some context and color our supply chain is intentionally diversified across multiple markets. A key initiative we started over four years ago. This allows us to quickly shift production when certain markets are affected by COVID or other issues. We've created a strategic supplier program, whereby we prioritize our partners with a presence across multiple markets, and maintaining these shifts to happen even more seamlessly. And we have proven pricing power. Elevating our AUR across every channel and geography over the last 4.5 years. So that we have room to absorb near-term pressures we've seen in our business, such as tariffs or current inflationary headwinds. This built-in agility gives us confidence as we continue to navigate a volatile global operating environment ahead, but I want to be clear that this is not just about our ability to play defense.  Even as macro challenges arise or subside, Ralph Lauren is firmly driving often to position the Company for long-term sustainable growth. We are leveraging our strong momentum to further accelerate investments across brand-building, personalization and new customer recruiting, digital, and key markets and categories in the months ahead. Reflecting on the last quarter, a few key highlights. First, our overall recovery is outpacing our expectations. This was led by out-performance in Europe and North America with Asia in line with our plan, and positive to fiscal 2020 or  despite extended COVID measures as our product assortments resonated strongly with consumers globally.  Second, our digital momentum continues following our reset work across product, pricing, and promotions last year. In our digital operating margins continued to be strongly accretive to our overall Company margin rate. And third, our elevation strategy is translating across all channels, including positive trends in wholesale across regions. On top of all of this, we made further progress toward our long-term target as mid-teens operating margins with second quarter margins of 17% representing the highest Q2 rate since Fiscal 13. And we achieve this even as we continue to reinvest for future growth and plan to increase returns to shareholders over the next several quarters. Our performance demonstrates our team's strong execution against the 5 strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our Next Great Chapter plan. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter across each one.  First on our efforts to win over a new-generation, we continued to invest in our brand-building initiatives to drive both new customer acquisition and retention in order to fuel long-term growth. In the second quarter, we further strengthened our brand consideration, purchase intent, and net promoter scores globally while Ralph Lauren brand sentiment also improved across every region. Some of our key campaigns underpinning these results included; the continuation of our summer sports program, with the U.S. Open Tennis Championships here in New York, as well as Team USA's victory at the 2021 Ryder Cup in golf. These came on the heels of our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team in Tokyo earlier in the quarter.  Together, these campaigns generated over 71 billion media impressions in the second quarter as we continue to inspire new-generations of athletes and dreamers. In September, we celebrated the return of fashion's biggest night, the Met Gala. And what better opportunity to showcase this year's team of American fashion than with one of the most iconic American brands, Ralph Lauren. Celebrities and influencers from Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck to Chance the Rapper and Lily Aldridge, were featured in our designs, driving strong engagement and traffic to our channels. Ralph's design of Lily Collins wedding dress, some of you will know her as Emily in Paris, garnered worldwide media attention.  And we were excited to announce a new collaboration this quarter with Zepeto, a metaverse or virtual world, where users Avatars, can socialize and create content. This partnership represents the latest frontier in digital engagement in which users can purchase exclusive digital Ralph Lauren apparel for their 3D avatars for the first time ever. Early engagement has outpaced our expectations with a 100,000 items already sold in just a few weeks. In all, we added 1.4 million new consumers to our direct-to-consumer channels alone this quarter, a 19% increase to last year. And our total social media followers continue to grow, reaching 46.9 million globally, led by Instagram.  Moving to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential, underdeveloped categories. Ralph and our design teams continue to inspire consumers around the world as they begin to incorporate sophisticated, casual styles back into their closets. While still seeking elevated comfort with categories like loungewear. We are uniquely positioned to capture this evolving hybrid way of dressing, given the breadth of our portfolio. And we're also making strong progress on our high potential categories like outerwear and denim. During the second quarter, we drove our core sportswear categories along with seasonal styles, such as transitional sweaters and fleece as we headed into early fall selling. On the men's side, we saw strength across bottoms, including denim, active styles, and shorts, as well as sweaters and performance suits.  Though a small parts of our business prior to COVID, tailored clothing and dress shirts continued to show sequential improvement. In women's, we drove outsized performance in sweaters, sweatshirts, mid layer knits, and bottoms. Outerwear, including transitional quilter jackets, updated lasers and denim jackets, also grew double-digits to doubled LY. This should bode well for the key outerwear selling period the following holiday. We also launched our new Ralph's Club fragrance globally with a digital first campaign featuring Lucas Haba and Gigi Hadid. This marked our first major fragrance launch in China. And in its first month, it ranked among the top 3 men's fragrances in key markets around the globe, including in the U.S. And more than 75% of purchases on ralphlauren.com were made by consumers who are new to the brand.  This takes me to our third key initiative; drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued the build-out of our brand, elevating key city ecosystems around the world in the second quarter. With 35 new stores in concessions opening in top cities globally and 13 locations closed. The majority of these store openings were in Asia, and particularly the Chinese Mainland, which continues to represent a significant long-term growth opportunity for our brand. Despite COVID-related shutdowns in July and August, our mainland sales were still up more than 25% to last year and more than 70% to double our OI in constant currency.  And comp trends rebounded quickly in September, once restrictions were lifted, we opened our second emblematic store experience in China at Shanghai's Kerry Center this quarter. Following our first opening in Beijing this spring. The emblematic concept provides an example of how we are transforming the retail experience with digital integration throughout, exciting in-store activations, and hospitality features like Ralph's coffee that are fueling new consumer\u2019s acquisition. Early performance is well ahead of our expectations, and these stores are also listing overall growth trends in their respective omni -channel ecosystems, moving to our priority of leading with digital.  Our global digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, department store.com, pure players, and social commerce, grew approximately 45% in the quarter in constant currency, and 50% to double LY. Our digital momentum continues, even as traffic returns to physical stores, driving a benefit to our overall operating margin mix. This is the result of our continued digital investments focused on content creation, data analytics, and AI to serve our consumers through an elevated, connected retail experience. Now, touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. As I mentioned, our teams continue to operate with agility and focus to mitigate supply chain headwinds, delivering better-than-expected gross and operating margins. In the second quarter.  At the same time, we continued to drive expense discipline as we accelerate both near term and multiyear investments in the back half of the year to fuel long-term growth. And lastly, on our brand portfolio, we successfully transitioned Chaps from our North America wholesale business to a licensed model in the second quarter, as previously announced. This completes our exit from moderate priced U.S. department stores, enabling our teams to focus on our core namesake brands and elevated positioning in the marketplace. I also want to take a moment to highlight our ongoing work to integrate citizenship and sustainability into everything we do. We recently announced the launch of the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund in partnership with the Soil Health Institute.  Funded by the Ralph Lauren corporate foundation, this program works directly with farmers to transition 1 million acres of American constant crop plan to regenerate the production. In all, it is set to eliminate 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere by 2026. Both increasing sustainable constant supply and making important progress in the urgent call to action on climate. We are proud to share today that this program is being recognized at the COP26 International Meeting on climate as an innovation spread partner by the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate. In addition, this quarter, we joined a global fashion agenda, strategic partner group, to prioritize sustainability and fashion, as well as Ellen MacArthur foundation as a partner in its mission to create a circular economy for our apparel.  And we were also honored to be recognized as one of the 2021 Best Places to Work for people with disabilities by the Disability Equality Index, and as one of the world's best employers of 2021 by Forbes. In closing, Ralph and I are strongly encouraged by the Company's progress through the first half of the fiscal year. All channels and geographies are showing strong momentum as we build on the healthier foundation, we set over the past 18 months. Our performance along with the resilience of our supply chain and pricing power in the market, gives us confidence as we accelerate our investments in the back half to support long-term growth. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice. And good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results outperformed our expectations with progress across each of our key strategic initiatives. Even in the midst of continued COVID, and supply chain headwinds around the world. Performance this quarter was driven by, strong top-line growth led by our full-price wholesale channels globally, and broad-based outperformance in Europe. Continued digital momentum across owned and third-party channels. Further gross margin expansion on top of last year's COVID mix benefits, with double-digit AUR growth and elevated product mix more than offsetting higher freight.  And higher-than-expected operating margins, including cost savings benefits, improved wholesale margins, and favorable channel mix shift from wholesale and digital. Second quarter revenues increased 26% to last year with positive growth in every region, led by Europe and North America. Compared to second quarter fiscal 20 or double LY, revenues declined 12%.  However, this included approximately 8 points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset of our distribution and our caps business, which moved to a licensed model. Total digital ecosystem sales grew approximately 45% in constant currency to last year and 50% to double LY, including 35% growth in our own digital business. Momentum continued across every region, reflecting our strong assortments, expanded connected retail capabilities, and high impact marketing. Digital margins were also strongly accretive to our second quarter profitability, consistent with last year and about 1,300 basis points higher than double LY. Total Company adjusted gross margin was 67.3% in the second quarter, up 80 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 50 basis points in constant currency. Despite increased freight headwinds of approximately a 150 basis points. Gross margins were better than expected despite lapping last year's unusual COVID mix benefits driven by better pricing and promotion along with favorable product mix and last year's supply chain organization streamlining, adjusted gross margins increased 580 basis points to LLY. Second quarter AUR grew 14% on top of 26% growth last year, with increases across every region.  This represents our 18th consecutive quarter of AUR gains as we continue on a brand elevation journey. And it gives us strong confidence in our sustained pricing power as we mitigate mid-to-high single-digit product cost inflation, starting in the second half of the year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 17% to last year, to $755 million and declined 5% compared to LLY, reflecting our restructuring savings. The increase to last year was driven by higher marketing and compensation as we lapped last year's furlough and store closures due to COVID. Marketing increased 83% to 6.1% of sales in the quarter, with a focus on new customer acquisitions and long-term brand building initiatives.  Operating expenses were below our initial plan as we shifted about $25 million of investments into the second half of the year, based on COVID disruptions. In the second half, we will increase marketing and talent investments to support growth this holiday and in-customer acquisition to drive longer-term growth. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 17.1% up 450 basis points to last year and 220 basis points to double LY. This was above our guidance of 13% to 14% margin, largely driven by improvements in Europe and North America Wholesale. Excluding the timing shift, operating margin was still well ahead of our plan, above 15%. Moving to segment performance, starting with North America. Second quarter revenue increased 30% to last year, supported by strong product assortments, new customer acquisition, and market share gains. Compared to LLY, North America revenues declined 20%, but included a 15 point headwind from our strategic distribution reset and Chaps similar to Q1. In North America, retail revenues grew 34% to last year.  Comps increased on improved traffic and 23% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick and mortar comps increased 31% driven by double-digit growth in AUR, basket sizes, and traffic. Although foreign tourists\u2019 sales improved significantly to last year, they were still down more than 80% to LLY, due to continued softness in international travel. Comps in our owned digital commerce business grew 32% this quarter.  This was driven by a strong product offering along with high-quality new consumer acquisition and retention of last year's new consumers, resulting in higher full-price sale. New consumers increased 12% to last year and more than 50% to LLY. And retention of the new consumers acquired last year improved meaningfully as we become increasingly effective at targeting and personalization. In North America wholesale, revenues increased to 23% to last year. This was ahead of our expectations as the foundational work we completed through COVID.  To reset our inventories, elevate our product mix, exit lower tier wholesale doors, and significantly reduce off-price penetration is delivering improved top-line growth and quality of sales. Total sell-out was up low double-digits in the second quarter to LLY led by a continued market share gains in men's, kids, and home. Lauren women's continue to stabilize sequentially, including share gains in women's ready-to-wear. Overall, wholesale AUR growth continues to accelerate up 30% to LLY as we elevated our assortments and pulled back on seasonal promotions in the channel. And our momentum on wholesale.com drove digital sellout growth of more than 45% to both last year and LLY. All of this is enabled by our healthier brand positioning and wholesale. And we see more to come as we are still in the early stages of driving our brand elevation strategy in this channel. Moving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue increased 38% on a reported basis, and 36% in constant currency, above our expectations. Revenue in selected to positive growth on a LLY basis this quarter, with all key markets performing better than planned, led by Germany and France. The U.K. our largest market in the region, and earliest to reopen this spring, also continued to perform better than planned on strong demand. Europe comps increased 27% in the quarter. Bricks-and-mortar comps were up 28% driven by improved traffic, AUR, and basket sizes. Digital commerce comps increased 24% on top of a 26% comp last year, when COVID-related closures shifted more business online.  Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter. Driven by stronger sell-out and reorders at both digital wholesale, as well as traditional wholesale accounts. Turning to Asia, revenue increased 14% on a reported basis, and 13% in constant currency. Our Asia retail comps increased 7% with 69% growth in digital commerce and 4% growth in bricks-and-mortar stores. Continued strong momentum in China and Korea this quarter more than offset extended COVID restrictions in Japan, our largest market in the region, as well as Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore. In total, COVID-related closures and operating restrictions negatively impacted Asia sales by about 3.5% in the quarter.  And while the Chinese Mainland still grew more than 25% this quarter, our performance was also tampered by COVID lockdowns from late July through August. On a positive note, mainland comps rebounded quickly in September once stores reopened, Japan comps also started to improve towards the end of the quarter with the government lifting all states of emergency following the end of our fiscal Q2. Our digital ecosystem continued to accelerate in Asia. In Q2, this was supported by our successful Chuseok, Thanksgiving holiday campaign in Korea, Qixi, Valentine\u2019s day in China, and it's overall momentum in our newer digital flagships in China, Japan, and Hong Kong. Moving onto the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.4 billion in cash in investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 5% modestly below our plan due to global supply chain delays. While we expect continued variability of inventory flows from quarter-to-quarter, we believe our inventories are well-positioned across key categories and channel to meet demand for the upcoming holiday and spring '22 seasons. Overall, we expect to improve our inventory positions as supply chain headwinds subside and plan to end the year with inventories better aligned to sales growth. As we move into the second half of this fiscal year, we are re-committing to our long-term capital allocation priorities outlined prior to COVID. This includes first, reinvesting in our strategic growth priorities, including brand marketing and elevation, digital, and expansion of our key city ecosystems to drive long-term sustainable growth. Second, with peak pandemic closures, likely behind us, we are focused on returning a 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We reinstated our dividend in the first quarter and we expect this to grow in line with durable net income growth. And we expect to resume our share repurchase program starting in the second half of this fiscal year, with about $580 million remaining under our current share authorization. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro-environment, including global supply chain challenges and COVID related disruptions. We expect the quarterly cadence this year to remain volatile given dynamic conditions across our markets. For fiscal 22, we are raising our revenue growth to 34% to 36% growth to last year in constant currency on a 53-week basis, excluding approximately 700 million in annualized revenue we reset during the pandemic.  This includes department store exits, off-price, and Digoo (ph) reductions, and the licensing and sale of Chaps and Club Monaco. This implies revenues up high single-digits to fiscal '20. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact full-year revenues by about 20 basis points. We expect gross margins to expand at the high end of our prior range of 50 to 70 basis points, or roughly 450 basis point increase to LLY. Our outlook improved on more favorable pricing and product mix this year, despite increased freight costs, which we now expect to be in the range of a 130 to 150 basis points due to our plans to use more airfreight to fulfill strong demand in the back half.  As a reminder, we renegotiated our ocean freight rates for the year in Q1. Raw materials, notably, cotton, will purchased roughly a year in advance, resulting in slightly favorable product costs through the first half of fiscal '22, This is followed by mid-to-high single-digit estimated cost increases in our second half ending March and through calendar 2022 which we expect to more than offset with continued AUR growth and productivity improvements. We raised our AUR outlook to high single-digit growth this year, above our long-term annual guidance of low to mid-single digits as we continue our elevation work. We still expect operating margins of 12 to 12.5%, which compares to 4.8% operating margin last year and 10.3% in fiscal '20. We continue to expect operating margin rates for the back half of the year to moderate from first half level based on increased second half marketing investments of approximately 7 to 8% of sales.  Reaching our full-year target of at least 6% of sales this year, increased airfreight expense in the back half of the year, and our assumption of more normalized channel mix compared to last year's COVID disruptions. For the full year, our increased revenue outlook implies high teams operating profit dollar growth compared to LLY pre -COVID level. For the third quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 14% to 15%.  Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by about a 140 basis points. While our teams are still actively focused on managing through global supply chain disruptions, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the right product at appropriate levels to meet consumer demand over the holiday selling period. We expect operating margins of about 13% to 13.5% in the third quarter, roughly in line with last year. This assumes modest gross margin expansion, largely offset by the timing shift in strategic investments, input cost inflation, and mix headwinds, I noted a moment ago. We now expect the full-year tax rate to be about 21% to 22% with a third quarter tax rate of around 22 to 23%. In closing, our strong first-half performance underscored the timelessness of Ralph's creative vision, the power of our brand, and our strengthening consumer base. With these as our foundation, we will leverage our momentum and invest in the key strategic initiatives that will support our long-term growth. And within a highly dynamic global environment, our teams around the world are executing with agility and playing offense to deliver long-term value creation for all our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator :  One moment please for the first question. First question comes from Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning, everyone. And congratulations on the continued progress and performance. I wanted to ask -- thank you. You discussed some of the drivers of your recent out performance, just a few moments ago on the call. What elements do you consider sustainable moving forward given the shifting environment? And where do you see the biggest risk to your strong performance looking ahead? And then if you could just touch on the accretion of the digital margins and where you see that going? That would be helpful. Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Good morning. Thank you for your question. Listen, we're certainly encouraged by the strong first half we've had this fiscal year, and what's really important to note from a mindset standpoint is we still have massive runway ahead of us. To a large extent, our brand continues to be much bigger than our business. So our performance so far has given us proof point and the confidence to continue investing in the multiple  that we had ahead of us. There are four that I would call out Dana, the first one, which is really our lifeblood, is customers. New customer acquisition.  And you've seen the numbers this past quarter up 19% versus last year, we're bringing in a younger consumer. We're bringing in a higher value consumer, a more profitable consumer, a less promotion sensitive consumer. We're very excited about that momentum. And we're going to continue to invest in this space to expand our footprint and also of course, drive retention. And we've seen very good progress on retention for customers that we've brought over the past few quarters.  Second area is around product and the breadth of our product portfolio and which we've talked in prior forms, really sets us apart from many other brands in this space. We have a lifestyle portfolio that ranges from tuxedos and evening gowns all the way to sweatshirts. And as you see consumers progressively reinvest into more elevated casual, we're incredibly well-positioned to meet that demand. And that's part of what's driven the success in Q2, is this ability to meet this hybrid customer expectation. Both more elevated products and also continued interest in athleisure.  We've been able to balance both well, on top of that, we've talked a lot about our high potential underdeveloped categories. And we've seen really nice momentum in these categories, but again, relatively early days in sneakers, outerwear, and denim, for example. So much more runway there. The third area is digital, right? And as you know, we've done a lot of work to reset here. Reset on products, reset on pricing, reset on brand presentation. We're seeing really good momentum in this channel across both our own sites, up 35% across pure players and breaking clicks up 57% this past quarter, total digit up 45%. What's exciting here is the momentum on digital continues as the stores are reopening.  So we're seeing consumers with an omni -channel mindset continue to engage both digitally and also in our stores. We are obviously going to continue to invest in capabilities in this space, functionality and connected retail experience. Notably, and you touched on it, our margin in digital continues to be accretive to our total Company margin. That is one -- of I think one of our most exciting achievements over the past year and the team has done a fantastic job to reset both product pricing, promotion, operations cost structure, in a way that this is accretive across all three regions. And our expectations is that we'll continue.  We expect digital to be our fastest-growing channel for the years to come. And we're really pleased that the digital margin is accretive to the Company margin. And we have full confidence is that we'll continue and expand. And then the final thing I would call on in terms of drivers is our focus on key cities. You know, we don't look at markets as much by country anymore. We really look at them as key cities and building and partner for the jargon, but building a connected omni -channel ecosystem in each of the key cities that's playing out really nicely, the combination of brick-and-mortar, pure-play, wholesale, brick-and-click, and our general digital wrapper.  We're seeing very strong response from the consumer in those cities where we've made these investments. You have a couple of examples in our prepared remarks of things that have happened recently in Shanghai, in Beijing. And we have more to come in the following quarters. When I look at the model we have there, the success we're seeing with it, and the opportunities we have ahead of us. Same thing, long runway in terms of our ability to go build these ecosystems around the world. So 4 key drivers that certainly drove the performance in Q2, and we will continue to play out for the long term. As far as risks are concerned, the biggest risks we're facing are clearly macro-related. Right from supply chain to cost inflation headwinds. I mean those are very real, we've touched on these in the script. And we believe we're actually very well-positioned to mitigate them because of our brand pricing power,18 quarters in a row of AUR growth with multiple levers to drive AUR, because of our newly diversified, agile, faster supply chain that is not dependent on one specific supplier or one specific country. So these headwinds are there, they are real, but we are very confident in our ability to mitigate them. And so I would say in this context, the biggest mistake we could make with these macro headwinds and these external pressures is actually a shift to defense. And as you've seen in our plans right now, we're on offense. We're executing our plans while mitigating the headwinds. We've got the resources to invest in the business. Our focus is on fueling our momentum next quarter, the quarter after that and for the long term. Thanks for your question, Dana. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Thank you so much. I have a 2-part question. My first question is, can we talk a little more about the current cost inflation environment? How are you expecting increased cost impact your ability to drive long-term AUR and operating margin from here. And my second question is -- a smart question is just can you talk about the pace of share buybacks? Would you expect to use all of the authorization they have available in the current fiscal year? Thanks so much. Jane Nielsen : Sure, good morning, Jay. Let me take your first question in two parts. First on the AUR trajectory, we are very confident in our ability to continue our elevation journey from here. We expect to continue driving both positive AUR and gross margin expansion in the back half of fiscal 22, and through our long-term plan. Over the last 18 consecutive quarters of AUR growth, we've developed a proven multileveled approach to pricing with a focus on creating value for the consumer and it's working.  So while we're still comfortable with our overall long-term guidance of low to mid-single-digit AUR growth, it's fair to expect that our AUR rates will be on the higher end over the next year as we work through higher costs, and we work those into our broader financial algorithm. On your operating margin question, we're still well on track towards the goal of mid-teens operating margin. Our full year fiscal '22 guidance puts us firmly on a path with around 200 basis points of expansion to pre -COVID OY levels. And we're planning to achieve this on a lower reset base of revenues. And with OY dollars substantially higher than pre -COVID levels as well. And embedded within our guide, our gross margins are expanding in spite of cost inflation and we're reinvesting back in the business because we have momentum. As Patrice mentioned, we firmly believe that now is the right time to invest in the long term. We've reset to a more profitable base and we're seeing strong momentum in our brands.  And we have the right tools in place to drive expanded AURs and gross margin. Now on your question about the pace of share buybacks. So we have, as you've noted, 580 remaining in our authorization, I would expect that over the -- historically we've done about $500 million over the course of a fiscal year. I would expect us to do at least that pace as we close out the year, but of course, we'll be looking at the value creation potential of the share buybacks looking at the market. But I think you can expect us to go at least as fast as we have historically in terms of about$ 500 billion over four quarters. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Thanks for taking our question. So Jane maybe -- just a couple of quick ones here. Maybe you can help us just aggregate how much -- North America slowed a little bit in both channels, maybe you can help us just aggregate how much the business transition line items impacted both the channels in North America in the quarter. And then I'd be curious if you might be able to help us think about how much supply chain may have held back North America in 2Q, just so we get an idea of what the magnitude of what's going on there is. And then, I guess, Patrice, you've got the wholesale AURs up now for a couple of quarters in a row. We've heard good news on that in the retail side for a long time.  So now that we've got a couple of quarters of AURs going up in that channel, as we look back as a 2018 Analyst Day, which I know is ancient history at this point. But you thought this business could do mid '60s gross margins at that time. And as we're looking at it now, you've got AURs, I think in a much better place than what you imagined at that time. We'd be curious to hear what you think the potential for this business is going forward. And then Jane, just one last one, fourth-quarter operating margin as guided sub 4% is that -- maybe just help us think about how much conservatism is baked in there versus actual cost that you're planning rising in the business. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Why don't I take the first part of your question in terms of the disaggregating North America growth? So if you think about North America growth, we have as we move into this second quarter, we are really encouraged by the strong -- overall strong performance in North America. We have a much stronger foundation for growth. Solid momentum in the business where we had to do most of the reset work in digital and in wholesale. And our Q2 guidance did assume a sequential LLY slowdown ex-resets, as we weren't expecting the same level of upside that we saw in Q1 based on some of the inventory restocking that we did in Q1.  But overall, Q2 was still in line or better than our expectations. I think that the other aspect in North America was we did see some traffic softness in the outlet centers as the Delta variant started to rise, sort of mid to late summer, which impacted traffic overall, but we certainly saw that impact. Now, encouragingly, we do see our conversion and our comp outpace the traffic in our web, but that was also part of the -- a bit of slowdown that we saw through the summer. Do I think this supply chain is impacting -- impacted some of that? Yes. I know that we had less airfreight coming in during that mid-summer level, so we were a little slow to get fall on the floor and make that transition. So I do expect that that impacted North America. When we started to airfreight in and we became more aggressive in airfreight as we closed out September, we saw a rise in comps in our outlet doors and we're very encouraged by that. So I do think it had an impact. There's a lot of dynamics going on, but I do think it had an impact and we were encouraged by the acceleration that we saw in September. Patrice Louvet : And then on wholesale AUR and gross margin expectations. So first of all, we're actually really pleased with the progress that's happening in wholesale on AUR and it's really to use a baseball analogy really -- early innings on this one, right? Probably first inning. You saw the number in the release AUR, U.S. wholesale of 30% versus LLY. With strong momentum there. And what I really like about the progress there is, it's multiple leavers. It's getting smarter on promotions when, how, where to implement them. It's like-for-like pricing.  It's investing into higher-value items. So all these leavers that we've seen play out in DTC were also seeing play out in wholesale and we're working very closely with our partners, and actually are very aligned in the approach that we want to drive moving forward. So I think long runway on AUR growth and expansion in wholesale and fundamentally help your businesses as a results of it. When it comes to gross margins guidance, Michael, we're not going to change our guidance long-term at this point.  We're still, as Jane mentioned, very committed to our mid-teens operating margin and very confident in our ability to get there. I think at this point, mid-60s for gross margin expectation in the near-term is consistent with what we said, and consistent with how to think about it. And then once we have the option to guide for the next phase of growth, then we can re-look at that together. But the general message is consistency of expectations with the focus, especially on the ability to deliver mid-teens operating margins for this Company. Jane Nielsen : And on your question regarding Q4 implied up margin, it is our smallest quarter and it's certainly our -- traditionally our smallest quarter from an -- on an OY basis. We are making substantial investments that Patrice noted, largely on new consumer acquisition and new digital sites, and digital investments, all of which will pay dividends into the future. It's not a one and done kind of return on investments. These will be a long-term investments and we're committed to making them. Where could be upside come? Really if we see revenues strengthen beyond our expectations into the fourth quarter, supply chain resolved, or especially the logistics aspect of supply chain resolves quicker than we expected. You could see some flows through there.  The pressures are twofold other than the small quarter, we're moving into some of the higher costs that we're seeing on a product basis. And you saw that we've taken up some of our estimate on freight now moving to 130 to 150 basis points. Obviously given -- freight was 60 basis points in the first quarter, 150 in the second quarter, the back half to get to our range is more substantial than that. So you see that pressure in the back-half. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. Patrice, maybe on the products side, could you help walk through key changes, maybe by category or collection that you've made to increase relevance with younger consumers as we exit the pandemic. Curious what you're most excited about into holiday. And then last, how do you see the brand positioned in a world potentially of greater overall casualization. Patrice Louvet : So Matt, I'm going to broaden your point, because the way we appeal to that younger consumer is also through how we present some of our core products, right? How to make our white polo shirt relevant for that younger consumer. And I think through the pivots we've made on marketing, going on the platforms that resonate the most with that younger consumer, whether that's TikTok or Snap, participating in those activities that are most relevant for them, like gaming, like engaging in the Metaverse, like what we've done recently with the Zepeto where we've seen very high level of engagement.  So the shift in our marketing has really helped broaden the appeal to the younger consumer, we see it in our data. As I mentioned, upfront on Dana's question, we are seeing a younger consumer coming into the franchise. As a result of the marketing content and targeting on the product front, we have, of course, also leveraged categories that resonate the most with the younger consumer Polo sports, which we've re-energized. And I think there's a really clear positioning now, is resonating very nicely. Elevated athleisure and fleece is also connecting nicely with that consumer. And then, some of our core, products are sweaters, or chinos, our denim. Some of our more elevated outerwear is also resonated -- quite resonating quite nicely with that younger consumer. So as I look at the broad categories that have been successful in the past quarter, and as we look ahead in terms of where we've invested, we feel very nicely positioned broadly, and in particular, for that younger consumer, whether that's again denim, investments in sneakers, driving more elevated casual that is resonating with that group both on the men's side and on the women's side.  And I'm actually very encouraged that the progression we're making in terms of attracting that younger and higher-value customer is not a one-quarter phenomenon. We've now seen this for a number of quarters and is the direct results of interventions -- targeted interventions we're making across product, across marketing, and across product brand distribution. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : The next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Thank you. Good morning and thanks so much for taking our question. Patrice and Jane, in your remarks, you called out marketing and other multiyear strategic investments to support long-term growth as a driver of SG&A investment into the second half. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the most important spend initiatives within SG&A, this year. You're into the back-half. What is within your control and accretive to long-term brand health? And are there any other components of SG&A that are rising, whether that's rising labor or given the well or -- other types of aspects of an inflation? Where do you see that opportunity into calendar '22? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : So maybe Jane will tag team on this one. In terms of Rob buckets broke into -- where we're focusing our investments moving forward that we expect to drive long-term growth, or one new customer acquisition, younger customer, higher-value customer. And we now have the tools with the consumer intelligence group that we have in place, with our ability to target and tailor the messaging to really be providing very high ROI on these types of investments. So we've seen the success behind them. We're going to dial that up across the region. The second is continued to fuel our digital momentum, right?  And that's combination of functionality on our own sites, elements of connected retail, work that we're doing with our wholesale partners, and you will see we have a number of exciting things coming online over the next couple of quarters when it comes to our digital capabilities. In addition to localizing sites, so expanding our footprint into new markets with localized propositions from the RalphLauren.com standpoint.  And then the third one is continuing to invest in building our store footprint in the context of our key city ecosystem. And we had two good examples recently with Shanghai and Beijing and there's more to come there. So these are investments that will not just generate an impact over the next one or two quarters, but there will have long-lasting effect. We really look at lifetime value of customers that we bring in to the franchise and we're actually really pleased with the profiles we're bringing in. We're really pleased with our retention performance. So these three areas will have a long runway in terms of contributions to growth and value creation. Jane Nielsen : Yes in fact as you think about some of the components of SG&A, we've talked about marketing being at least 6% obviously, with some of the shift we did, the $25 million that came out in the first half and went into the second half. You'll see heavier marketing spend into the second half because we're able to sort of post COVID and restrictions and shutdown, we're able to activate things like the Australian Open. And we have the events coming up, the Fashion Show, Fashion Week coming up.  Those things will be activated and that's a portion of the spend that shifted. You will see this back half be closer to 7% to 8% of sales relative to our run rate, which is about 5.8% of sales into this quarter for the first half. Now, outside of SGNA versus -- outside of marketing, I'm sorry, versus last year, SMB is normalizing. Last year we had furloughs, and we had government subsidies during the height of the pandemic. We're obviously open across all our stores now. And we are seeing some wage rate pressure.  It's been most notable in our distribution centers with temporary and hourly workforce, and in our retail stores. I'm pleased to say that we are well staffed right now. But there is some inflation in wages that we saw, and of course we're committing this year to opening new doors, as a part of our drive towards direct-to-consumer, we're going to open 90 new doors this year, and there is some investment and expenses associated with that. Now, if you -- as you ask in terms of what do we have control of? Overall, we're committed to making these investments.  We do have some control over marketing, as you saw us exercise in the first half to make sure we are in tune with local markets and the operating dynamics that we're working with today, we do feel now is the right time, just with the holiday and what we're seeing in terms of opening around the country. Now is the right time to invest. And as Patrice mentioned, we're also investing in local e-commerce sites to have a very strong ROI and payback after the first 10 months. Corinna Van Der Ghinst : And the last question, please, Angela. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Thanks for squeezing me in. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, John. John Kernan : Good morning. Good thanks. Going back to North America, the $700 million in revenue that we're taken out of the business globally. I think a lot of that is from North America. Just curious, how should we -- we should think about wholesale and retail within North America? And what a sustainable growth rate in North America might look like as we exit the pandemic. Jane Nielsen : So let me just start with the $700 million of pressure, which you're exactly right, is predominantly in North America. And what's going to manifest itself through Wholesale, though significantly is the pressure from the Chaps moving to a licensed model. So that's a little more than 10 points of pressure in the second half to our Wholesale business.  I think it's absolutely the right strategic moves underlying except reset, we expect continued momentum outside of Chaps in our wholesale business and higher levels of profitability, as Patrice mentioned. In retail, obviously, Club Monaco will be excluded from our overall corporate results. But in retail, we expect as the situation of COVID normalizes that we'll see better traffic back to the store. We've got strong conversion rates, strong AUR growth plan that we've already put up and planned for balance of year that will help us drive overall retail.  We're planning for some store openings in North America and continuing comp growth. On a long-term basis, we haven't yet guided the region, but we do expect North America is on a healthy base and is positioned from -- for growth from here out. You see the digital momentum, you see it's gaining share in wholesale. And we're very encouraged by what our existing store base can do and our new store base could do. Patrice Louvet : Yeah. I think if you in did you're going to step back and say, okay, where are the drivers of North America are going to be moving forward? And you heard me say last quarter -- I think it was last quarter and there have been this confidence in our ability to win in North America since I started and that comment and confidence completely holds true as we speak together today. As Jane mentioned, if you look at the key vectors of growth moving forward, digital, right? We now have, after a painful reset, dealing with Daigou, dealing with the site that was over promotional that didn't have the right product offering.  We've now showed very good about our ralphlauren.com site in the U.S. both in terms of how the brand has presented, are engaging with consumers. The connected retail capabilities that come with it and of course, the profitability. So that's the first element. Second element, as you mentioned, is our retail footprints, right? Both productivity in our outlet and expanding our own full-price store footprint, so more to come in this space. But we know that there\u2019s an opportunity for us to increase our presence -- physical presence from a DTC standpoint in a number of key cities in the U.S. and that work is well underway with a format that we're excited about, and a brand sensation that we're excited about.  And then the final point is now Wholesale, which used to be a drag in a bit of an albatross candidly around our necks, is now reset, is now on a healthy base both the brick-and-mortar side, where week flows as reminder, 65% of all our locations over the past 3 - 4 years. And the digital front, you saw the digital numbers. This -- the digital growth numbers from wholesale this quarter are quite strong and we believe only the beginning of the long journey. So multiple vectors of growth, Jane, as you mentioned, we're not ready to guide North America longer-term, but I think both of our behalf, I could say we have a lot of confidence in our ability to not only grow, but win in this market, right?  The last thing I would leave you with is recent -- latest share readings. We're growing share in men's, we're growing share in kids, we're growing share in home, we're growing share in women's ready-to-wear, and there's more to come. So we've got really nice momentum, a healthy foundation, and we're investing to win. All right, with that, we're going to close it here. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our third quarter fiscal '22 results with you in February. In the meantime, we hope to welcome you at the Polo Bar, little advertising never hurts, which just reopened here in New York City a couple of weeks ago where you can experience the magic of the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. Thank you for joining and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

We were pleased to report strong third quarter performance during the important holiday season. Our better-than-expected results across all 3 regions are a testament to the outstanding work our teams have done to fundamentally reposition our business, elevate our brand and pivot to offense, including in North America, where our turnaround is well underway. Our significant reset work is behind us. Our brand is strong, and our growth is supported by multiple levers, from geographic and channel expansion to recruiting new higher-value consumers and developing high potential product categories. While we expect these growth levers to be sustainable and deliver in the future, they are already driving profitable growth, with all of our regions reporting positive increases to last year and pre-pandemic levels. And we delivered this broad-based performance while many of our markets around the world are still managing through the impacts of COVID. Let me share a few highlights from the third quarter across the 5 strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our Next Great Chapter plan. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation, consumers around the world are connecting more than ever to our brand positioning and product portfolio. Together with our multifaceted strategy for demand creation honed through the pandemic, we are engaging both new and existing consumers in exciting ways. This is particularly evident in our fiscal third quarter, where we shifted a significant portion of this year's investments to drive brand momentum across a diverse range of activities. From celebrity activations to the metaverse, we drove a significant increase in digital share of voice globally. These activations not only drove our strong top line outperformance in the quarter, but also helped recruit younger full-price consumers to the brand, particularly on our digital channels. New consumers on our digital sites grew 58% to LLY, including an increased penetration of next-generation under 35 and higher-value consumers. For the critical holiday period, our brand tracking data showed that our high-impact campaigns further increased consumer perceptions of Ralph Lauren as a key destination for gifting in all regions. Online search trends across our family of brands also grew strong double digits the last year, significantly outperforming peers in our largest markets in Q3. Some of the innovative holiday campaigns that drove brand heat and enabled consumers to engage with and shop our brand in new ways included : first, we expanded our leadership in the metaverse with our Ralph Lauren Winter Escape program on Roblox, where we recreated the world of Ralph Lauren with an immersive holiday theme user experience and exclusive digital apparel collection for purchase. Roblox is one of the top interactive digital platforms in the world, and particularly for Gen Z, with 47 million users. This follows last quarter's world of Ralph Lauren launch on another popular metaverse, ZEPETO, where we continue to gain traction with over 2.5 million visits to date and maintain the #1 rank among all brands on the platform. You may have seen our mobile pop-ups and synchronized drone shows in select cities this holiday, featuring hundreds of drones lighting up the night sky to celebrate the return of festive dressing and our customizable gifts. We also drove highly successful live streaming events during the quarter, including our brand elevating Singles' Day and FARFETCH holiday live streams. In China, we continue to leverage our work with key influencers, accompanying the launch of our first major fragrance in the market this fall, our collaboration with popular actor and singer, Xiao Zhan, sold 40,000 units of Ralph's Club fragrance in a 6-hour period in December. Looking to the fourth quarter, we will continue to drive this momentum with iconic brand moments in sports and culture, including our Spring '22 fashion show in New York, our sponsorship of Team USA in the Winter Olympics opening today and our second year sponsoring the Australian Open, all of which you will see amplified across our global digital campaigns. Moving to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph created the quintessential American luxury lifestyle brand more than 50 years ago. His vision is one that has always been about a world to aspire to rather than any single product, category or fashion cycle. While the Polo brand and elevated sportswear still sit at the heart of what we do, Ralph Lauren is one of the few brands in the marketplace with the authenticity, quality and credibility to deliver products ranging from fleece hoodies to evening gowns and from accessories to home. Our multi-category lifestyle proposition affords us the flexibility and competitive advantage to deliver for consumers whatever the backdrop. And this flexibility enables us to be agile as consumers shift their wardrobes to a new hybrid mix of elevated but comfortable casual styles, for example, mixing our women's cashmere joggers with our sophisticated Sawyer wool tuxedo jacket. Our fall holiday performance in Q3 is a great example of how Ralph and our design teams are effectively capturing this mix, which is translating into market share gains around the world. Let me share just a few of these highlights. Our Boston Common apparel collection introduced an expanded assortment of elevated heritage icons driving strong sales in our stores with our most aspirational consumers. Our holiday Cortina collection celebrated Alpine style in a sophisticated palette of blues and whites. We drove a strong return of our sweater business with an expanded offering of our iconic cashmere styles, along with the introduction of new modern active hybrid models. And we continue to drive outsized performance in outerwear, one of our high-potential categories, which has grown about 50% since the start of our Next Great Chapter strategy. Q3 outerwear sales were fueled by an expanded range of active insulated models, including our newest collection of RLX Performance for men as well as elevated shearling, wools,and cashmere for women. As we continue to drive brand heat and new consumer acquisition, special capsules this quarter included : Black on Black; our latest limited-edition Major League Baseball drop; our bold new U.S. Olympics capsule, inspiring a new generation with looks rooted in active and performance outerwear, fleece and mitts; and for our brand loyalist on the Polo app, our 7 Days, 7 Drops Polo bear skateboard decks with Gossip Girl star and skateboarder, Evan Mock, kicking off the event at our Prince Street store. Shifting gears to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued our long-term strategy of investing in our brand-elevating key city ecosystems around the world in the third quarter with 40 new stores and concessions opening in top cities globally. This included our first European flagship opening since 2010 in Milan with early performance beating our plans by double digits. The majority of our store openings were in Asia and particularly the Chinese Mainland, where our brand momentum remains very strong despite recurring COVID shutdowns. Our Mainland sales were still up more than 20% to last year and 65% to LLY in constant currency. The highly innovative emblematic concept stores we opened in Beijing and Shanghai earlier this year, continued to perform ahead of our expectations, lifting overall growth trends in their respective city ecosystems, and our Singles Day performance significantly outpaced the competition despite our less promotional approach. As we start to expand our successful key city ecosystem blueprint around the world, we were particularly excited to open 4 new full price stores in North America this quarter in Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Detroit. This represents our highest number of full-price store openings in North America in 6 years and commences a new phase of retail growth in our home market following several years of repositioning. Having substantially reset the profitability of our full price fleet over the past year through enhanced category offerings, new ways of selling and operational discipline, we are moving forward with our plan to open about a dozen new margin-accretive full-price stores in North America over the next couple of years. Moving to our priority of leading with digital. Sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, Departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, grew more than 40% in the third quarter in constant currency and more than 60% to LLY, ahead of our plan. Within our own sites, digital sales grew more than 30%. This was driven primarily by full-priced holiday selling as we deliver the right mix of product, pull back on promotions and invest in AI-powered targeting and new full-price consumer acquisition. We continue to scale and expand on the connected retail capabilities we launched during the pandemic from virtual selling appointments to buy online, pick up in store, to endless aisle product availability. We launched our first ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile shopping app in time for holiday, seamlessly leveraging our connected retail capabilities to deliver our most personalized and content-rich platform to date. Now touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our teams continue to operate with agility to mitigate macro headwinds, delivering better-than-expected gross and operating margins again in the third quarter. The global operating environment remains highly dynamic. Notably with COVID, supply chain and cost inflation still pressure points coming into calendar 2022. However, we remain confident in our ability to manage these headwinds, to deliver further growth and operating margin expansion through our proven pricing power as well as our culture of cost discipline. This discipline is helping us to fuel our strategic investments in long-term growth. And further, part of investing in our business also includes a commitment to investing in our people and innovation. A few recent highlights include the following : in December, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation announced a $2 million donation in scholarships for students at historically Black colleges and universities. This is part of our broader commitment to invest directly in the future of Black students with enhanced access to education and advancing our recruitment and development programs for Black talent. We were also recently proud to achieve a score of 100% once again on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earned the designation as the best place to work for LGBTQ equality. On the sustainability front, just a few weeks ago, we were incredibly excited to launch our first product made with Clarus, a first-to-market patented technology that uses recycled cotton to create a high-performance fabric. Developed by natural fiber welding, which we announced an investment in last year, CLARUS has all the features we've come to expect from synthetic performance materials like comfort, breathability and moisture management while reducing our reliance on synthetics that use fossil fuels such as polyester and nylon. This is a critical step in scaling our use of recycled cotton and making progress on our target of sustainably sourcing 100% of our key materials, including cotton by 2025. This latest launch comes on the heels of our groundbreaking introduction last year of Color on Demand, the world's first scalable zero wastewater cotton dying system. And lastly, we announced an exciting new limited partnership with Franklin Venture Partners in Silicon Valley, focused on female-led businesses, the partnership backed disruptive technologies and consumer solutions with the potential to positively transform the fashion industry. Like our investment in natural fiber welding, this move underscores our long-standing commitments to innovation, sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion. In closing, Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the performance our teams have delivered through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. All channels and geographies are showing strong momentum as we build on an increasingly healthy foundation, leveraging work that we started well before the pandemic, but accelerated through this time of challenge. Looking ahead, we are focused on driving sustainable growth supported by continued investments across digital, our brand building and more personalized demand creation as well as key markets and categories. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day this summer. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were very strong and well ahead of our expectations. Our growth was broad-based across multiple levers in our business and delivered improved operating margin and profit growth of 52%. Consumer response to our fall and holiday offerings was strong and our teams are navigating supply chain challenges with agility. Their passion and tireless work produced strong progress across each of our key strategic initiatives. We were particularly encouraged to report North America's pivot back to high-quality revenue and operating profit growth versus pre-pandemic levels, continued double-digit growth across Europe and Asia businesses and strong digital momentum, all while investing for growth and delivering both growth and operating margin expansion. We continue to generate strong cash flow and increased our cash returns to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. Importantly, we achieved these results in the context of navigating a still uncertain macro environment. Total company revenues increased 27% to last year, with positive growth in every region, led by North America and Europe. Compared to third quarter fiscal '20 or LLY, revenues increased 4%. This 4% includes 7 points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset of our distribution and our Chaps business, which moved to a license model, implying low double-digit growth to LLY on an underlying basis. Strong and highly profitable growth continued in our digital ecosystems. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew more than 40% in constant currency to last year and more than 60% to LLY. This includes more than 30% growth in our owned digital business reflecting our strong product assortments, new consumer acquisition, expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. Digital margins remain strongly accretive to our third quarter profitability. Total company adjusted gross margin was 66% in the third quarter, up 60 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 90 basis points in constant currency, despite increased freight headwinds of approximately 150 basis points. Gross margins were better than expected despite lapping last year's unusual COVID mix benefits, driven by better pricing and promotions along with favorable product mix. Adjusted gross margins increased 380 basis points to LLY. Our brand elevation work continued with third quarter AUR up 18% on top of 19% growth last year, with increases across every region. Driven by favorable product mix and strong pricing power in the marketplace, we are confident in our ability to navigate this inflationary cycle. We expect to continue growing AUR above our long-term targets into fiscal '23 to mitigate mid- to high single-digit product cost inflation. Adjusted operating expenses increased 22% to 50.1% of sales, a 210 basis point decline to last year, but a 190 basis point increase to LLY on increased marketing investments. Marketing grew 78% to 8% of sales in the third quarter to support a number of initiatives around holiday, our digital expansion into new markets and categories and new consumer acquisition. As discussed last quarter, we shifted a significant portion of our marketing investments from the first half to the second half of the year to accelerate our brand momentum and direct-to-consumer expansion coming out of the pandemic. We expect a similar level of marketing dollar spend in the fourth quarter to support our Spring '22, Lunar New Year and digital campaigns, including our new Ralph Lauren mobile app and digital home shop. Other fourth quarter activations include Beijing Winter Olympics and the Australian Open as well as our continued focus on high-value new consumer acquisition. Based on increased confidence in our demand creation activities, we now expect marketing in the range of 7% to 7.5% of fiscal '22 sales. This year's elevated level of investment is supporting increased content creation, new consumer acquisition, our digital launches, new store openings and key brand moments coming out of the peak of the pandemic. Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 15.9%, up 260 basis points to last year and 190 basis points to LLY. This was above our guidance of 13% to 13.5% margin, driven by stronger gross margins and operating expense leverage on higher sales. Moving to segment performance, starting with North America. A very strong holiday selling season accelerated third quarter revenue to 30% growth to last year, with both wholesale and retail performing significantly above our expectations. This was driven by improved product assortments, new full-price consumers and market share gains. These strong results reinforce our confidence in North America as a driver of growth into the future. Compared to LLY, North America revenues increased 2%, a meaningful improvement from first half trends. These results included a 15-point headwind from our strategic distribution reset and Chaps, implying even stronger high-teens growth to pre-COVID levels on an underlying basis. While resets are expected to have an even larger impact on our reported North America revenues in Q4, we expect continued sequential improvement on an underlying basis to LLY. In North America retail, comps grew 38% to last year and 9% to LLY. Comps increased on improved traffic, conversion and 24% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product mix, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick-and-mortar comps accelerated to 40%, driven by double-digit growth in AUR, basket sizes and traffic. We were particularly encouraged by improved trends in our factory stores, which have been disproportionately impacted by weaker traffic through the pandemic, including a lack of foreign tourist travel. While U.S. border restrictions were eased in early November, Q3 foreign tourist sales still declined 35% to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to monitor for potential impacts from Omicron and other variants closely. We drove further momentum in our own digital commerce business this quarter with comps up 32%, supported by strong full-priced holiday selling. Our continued focus on full price new consumer acquisition helped deliver larger basket sizes at significantly higher quality of sales on our site. In North America wholesale, revenues increased 11% to last year, including a 16-point negative impact from our deliberate resets and Chaps. Underlying growth and quality of sales continued to exceed our expectations for the quarter, led by our full price businesses. Total sellout was up 25% to LLY in the third quarter, led by continued market share gains in men's, kids, home and women's ready to wear in our key partners. Our brand elevation in this channel continued with wholesale AUR up more than 30% to LLY this fall as we elevated our assortments and pulled back on seasonal promotions. And our momentum on wholesale.com drove digital sell-out growth of more than 35% to last year and 50% to LLY. Inventories at our full-price North America department store partners remained very healthy and clean at the end of the quarter, declining more than 20% to LLY. Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue increased 47% on a reported basis and 50% in constant currency, above our expectations. On a LLY basis, revenue growth accelerated 6% with stronger performance in France and the U.K. more than offsetting COVID-related restrictions in Germany and the Netherlands near the end of the quarter. Europe comps increased 55%. Brick-and-mortar comps were up 68%, with double-digit increases across all markets. Digital commerce comps increased 27% on top of a challenging 68% last year when COVID-related closures shifted more business online. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, driven by stronger sellout and reorder trends across wholesale brick-and-mortar and dot-com. We launched 30 campaigns with our top partners to deliver 500 million impressions over the quarter, including special holiday gifting experiences. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 16% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency. This quarter represents our highest ever revenue and operating profit for the region despite ongoing COVID impacts. Our Asia retail comps increased 14%, with 64% growth in digital commerce and 12% growth in brick-and-mortar stores. Performance exceeded our expectations going into the quarter, primarily due to strong recovery trends across every key market led by Japan and Korea. China Mainland sales remained robust despite government-mandated COVID controls in certain areas. Mainland sales grew 22% to last year, including 2 points of negative impact from COVID closures in the quarter and grew 65% to LLY. Our digital ecosystem momentum also continued in Asia this quarter with triple-digit growth to LLY. This was supported by key events like Singles' Day and our 12/12 activations, where our brands ranked #2 on both Tmall's Luxury Pavilion and JD luxury platform. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 7%, slightly below our plan due to ongoing global supply chain delays, which will shift some inventories into our fiscal Q4. While still highly dynamic, we are seeing some improvement on lead times and our inventories are well positioned to meet demand for the spring season, thanks to the agility of our teams and a flexible inventory allocation process. We now expect to end the fiscal year with inventories roughly in line with sales growth to support the upcoming Spring '22 season. Overall, we continue to manage our inventories closely to demand in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, including global supply chain challenges, Omicron and other COVID-related disruptions. For the full year fiscal '22, we are again raising our top line outlook based on stronger-than-expected demand across geographies. We now expect revenues to grow in the range of 39% to 41% in constant currency, up from 34% to 36% previously, all on a 53-week basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by about 70 basis points. We are also raising our operating margin outlook to approximately 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis, up from 12% to 12.5% previously, reflecting our stronger performance through the first 3 quarters of the year. Compared to fiscal '20, or LLY, our updated outlook now implies we are on track to end this year with full year revenues roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels, despite about 10 points of headwind from our strategic reset, operating margin more than 250 basis points higher and profit dollars expanding by more than $175 million as we grow off a healthier and more profitable base. For the fourth quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to increase about 17% to 18%. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by about 400 basis points. We expect gross margin expansion of about 160 to 180 basis points in constant currency, or 50 to 70 basis points on a reported basis. Continued growth in AUR should more than offset increased freight and material costs. We expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand approximately 80 basis points to 4.2% in constant currency with continued gross margin expansion more than offsetting increased marketing investments to fuel future growth. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 120 basis points. We expect fourth quarter and full year tax rate around 21% to 22%. Lastly, our capital allocation priorities remain largely unchanged, with a focus on reinvesting behind our key strategic initiatives and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed $300 million in share buybacks in the third quarter with approximately $280 million remaining on our current authorization, plus an additional $1.5 billion repurchase plan recently approved by our Board. In closing, our teams around the world are operating with agility and passion to drive brand desirability and deliver growth across multiple levers, all while navigating a still volatile global environment. Our strong year-to-date performance underscores the timelessness of Ralph's creative vision, our strengthening consumer base and the power of our brand. We are playing offense to leverage our momentum and invest in the key strategic initiatives to support our long-term growth and value creation. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Thanks a lot for all the detail. You gave us a lot to choose from here, a lot of areas we're repositioning look like they're lifting off all at once. Maybe I'll start there. There's been a lot of moving parts over the last 2 years through COVID and through the strategic resets. As you guys enter calendar '22 here, maybe you could talk to us a little bit about how you see Ralph Lauren positioned for the future and where you see the biggest differences in the go-forward strategy? And then, Jane, here we are with the new guidance, we're at mid-teens EBIT margins for the year. That's in line with your long-term guidance. So I guess the question there is, what's next? How should we think about EBIT margins as we think about calendar '22, given all the acute costs the industry is experiencing right now, which arguably some of them will be tertiary, but -- or transitory? But maybe your longer-term thinking on margins, but also I'm really focused on '22, how you see the margin profile rolling forward, given what you just delivered in the quarter. Patrice Louvet : Sounds good, Michael. Listen, on the first part of your question, I would outline a few things. First, we have fundamentally repositioned our business over the past couple of years. And this is clearly visible through the performance, not just this quarter, as you highlighted, but also over the prior quarters. And clearly, as Jane closed in her opening remarks, the company is back on offense. And so based on that, I have a lot of confidence in our ability to comp this year's outsized recovery growth and deliver sustainable growth ahead. Here's why, our company is fundamentally healthier than it was 2 years ago. If you look at the different elements, the brand is elevated, it's strong, it's desirable around the world. We're bringing in a younger, higher value consumer, less price-sensitive consumer. And our growth is broad-based: geographies, channels and brands. So looking to the future, we clearly have multiple engines for growth that are delivering both now, and we are confident are sustainable for the mid to long term. And there are really 3 that I would call out. First of all, on the product front, our unique lifestyle positioning means we can drive our core, while also continuing to scale high-potential underdeveloped categories like home, outerwear and others. The second one is on the channel front, right? I think as you've seen through the performance this past quarter and in prior quarters, our digital business is strong, broad-based, whether that's our own digital or pure players or bricks and clicks. We've got a compelling blueprint for retail growth, and I'm particularly energized by the fact that we're now opening stores in the U.S., which we haven't done in almost a decade. And then the third area is our wholesale is now rightsized. It's on a healthy foundation. And if you look at the way the consumer is voting, looking at market share, we're growing share across our core categories, again this past quarter. So lots of opportunities from a channel standpoint. And then finally, from a geographical standpoint, you know we take a key city lens to the world and we look at our top 30 cities around the world, and we see growth opportunities across all the key markets, notably in North America. Now we're obviously not immune to macro challenges, but I hope you all see that we've built a business and a supply chain that are both strong and resilient, and we have demonstrated pricing power as we've been elevating AUR consistent with our brand elevation work for several years now. And you saw that again in this past quarter. So the short answer, Michael, to your question, is that we're optimistic about the future, we have multiple levers to fuel our growth, not just over the next year but well beyond that. And now Jane will get -- give us perspective on our margin. Jane Nielsen : All right. So Michael, just as you called out, our third quarter is very encouraging to us from the margin expansion that we were able to achieve. And of course, it gives us confidence as we move into our next fiscal year. We're not guiding specifically. But I can tell you right now, we still feel that our mid-teens OI margin is the right long-term target for us. What I think you've seen us deliver is sequential progress along that growth, that's our mindset right now. And we are very clear-eyed about the challenges going into next year. I think we've stated that we still expect gross margin expansion to be a driver for us into next year, and our increased revenue growth is going to leverage SG&A to help us deliver EBIT margin expansion as we move into the long term. We'll have much more for you as we come out of the fourth quarter. We're planning an Investor Day to provide even more perspective, but that's the way we're thinking about it now. Operator : The next question comes from Beth Reed with Truist Securities. Beth Reed : Can you give us some more color on what drove the gross margin outperformance in the third quarter? And then also, what gives you confidence in your ability to drive further gross margin expansion, I guess, just beyond this year, given increased cost headwinds? And then relatedly, with AUR trends year-to-date running well ahead of your raised high single-digit outlook, just curious where you're seeing the most upside versus your expectations. Are there certain categories or channels or regions that you'd call out? Jane Nielsen : Of course. As I said, we were very pleased with our Q3 performance, and we're pleased that we've been able to raise our gross margin outlook again this quarter all in the context of comping last year's outsized gross margin gains that were primarily channel mix-driven, offsetting this year's supply chain and logistics pressures, and we're able to raise gross margin while still gaining momentum across all of our regions even on a pre-pandemic basis. So very encouraged. This holiday specifically, what drove our outsized performance was really our consumers, which shopped early and shopped at full price. So we got ahead of the curve on the holiday, and we maintained that momentum through the holiday without pulling significant promotional levers. We were much less promotional this year than we were last year. I think that's based on the desirability of our brand. We're seeing that in the consumer scores that Patrice mentioned and very strong reaction to our products. So very encouraging there. As we think about the long term, we really have multiple tailwinds to leverage. And again, given our view of the upcoming inflationary cycle, we feel well positioned to leverage them. First of all, there's the increasing desirability of our brand. Second, there's the new full-price consumer acquisitions that we' re doing : bigger basket sizes, higher AUR purchasing. We also have some, I'd say, long-proven pricing capabilities across multiple levers. We don't just take a like-for-like pricing increase across the board. We really look at the competitive environment. We balance that with promotion, driving into personalization. All of those tools, we'll be leveraging into next year. Our product elevation and category migration is working and enhancing both our AUR and our gross margin, and we have favorable geographic and channel mix on our side. Now on the headwind side, we've been very clear that the magnitude of gross margin expansion in fiscal '23 will be tempered by cost inflation, especially raw materials costs, which we called out early last quarter, and we expect to be with us through the spring of '23. But this modest gross margin expansion combined with SG&A leverage is really what allows us to reiterate what I just said to Michael, which is we still believe our mid-teens guidance is the right guidance and sequentially improve. And finally, I can't talk about my confidence in gross margin without really calling out the agility and capability and passion of our teams. They've done a magnificent job managing through some challenging environments, and we know they're committed to doing that in the future. Patrice Louvet : And Beth, to give some color on specific categories or channels or geographies where we've seen different AUR growth, the one thing I would highlight -- because it was actually pretty broad-based and you saw, right, plus 18% on top of plus 19% last year total company, pretty broad-based. But the thing we're clearly delivering on is the acceleration in North America, right? And our AUR growth rate progression is actually the fastest of all the regions. And we now have all the engines of AUR growth by channel motoring ahead, particularly wholesale, right? And I really appreciate the partnership we have with our key wholesale players here in North America because I think we're fully aligned on how we want to approach promotional strategy, pricing and product elevation as part of our overall proposition. We saw very strong AUR growth in wholesale. We saw very strong AUR growth on our digital business as well as across our brick-and-mortar presence. So this is the one that started latest of all 3 regions, right? Really, the journey started first in Asia, then in Europe and now in North America. We're still very early innings, particularly in wholesale. So as we look at it through that lens, we think there are many, many more quarters to come in our ability to drive AUR. Maybe not at the pace we've delivered this year, but certainly consistent AUR growth moving forward. Operator : The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas Exane. Laurent Vasilescu : Jane, I think you said that the reset was about a 700 basis point impact to 3Q North America. And I think you mentioned that it may have a bigger impact in 4Q. Just want to be sure if you can quantify. And then I think, Patrice, on this note, I think you said in your prepared remarks, great to hear that the reset is significantly behind you. Just curious to know, is there any more left to consider when we think about the year out and your Investor Day? Jane Nielsen : Yes. Laurent, let me take the first part of your question. Yes, it was 700 basis points to full company and obviously much more significant to North America, and about 15 basis points -- 15-point impact in North America. As we move forward, when you think about the resets, we'll anniversary the department store exits this year along with the daigou reset as we come out of the fourth quarter. There will still be some pressure, notably in wholesale, because of our Chaps conversion to a licensed model. And that pressure point will be notable in North America in the fourth quarter. So it's important to look at those resets. The fourth quarter is meaningful. And then, of course, we lap out as a total company of Club Monaco as of June. But you're right to keep a look out, especially in North America on that reset impact in the fourth quarter. Patrice Louvet : And Laurent, just to double down on the North America number. Therefore, I think from a LLY standpoint, North America was up something like 16% or 17% like-for-like, right? Which that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully, you feel the enthusiasm and the confidence we have in our trajectory in North America because the numbers are clearly playing that out. Beyond the things that Jane mentioned in terms of reset, Laurent, I think we are complete. So we will continuously challenge every location in which the brand is sold. But that\u2019s part of our ongoing model as we continue to make sure that\u2019s kind of showing up in the right place and is obviously delivering attractive returns. But the heavy lifting from a brand portfolio standpoint, from a door closure standpoint, from a pullback on daigou online and a major pullback relative to promotional activity, that will be behind us as we close out this fiscal year. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on a nice quarter. So 2-part question. Patrice, can you elaborate on the hybrid wardrobing behavior that you cited, and just changes that you've made to position the brand for this backdrop? And then, Jane, if we think about your low to mid-single-digit top line growth algorithm before the pandemic, I guess maybe what's your confidence today potentially exiting the pandemic as we think about growth drivers in North America, Europe and Asia, maybe relative to those drivers as we saw a couple of years ago before the crisis? Patrice Louvet : Sure. So listen, on product, the first thing I would call out is that our lifestyle positioning, the breadth of our offering really puts us in a strong competitive position to flex with consumer needs and their wardrobe evolution. And I think that's a real differentiating point for our company relative to many peers in this industry. The second thing I would call out is the fact that we've seen a new product apparel cycle start in the spring -- and I think we talked about this together last time, and accelerate in the fall. And what's exciting about it, I think it's still very early innings with many tailwinds ahead because the consumer hasn't really fully returned to work and certainly hasn't fully returned to more regular external activities. So what we're seeing on the hybrid approach by consumers is, on the one hand, a replenishment of their core wardrobe, and on the other hand a gravitation towards newness and sophistication. Let me peel the onion a little bit on that to give you a specific product category examples. So replenishing core elements of the wardrobe, those are things like denim, sweaters, those types of products. On the pivoting towards newness and sophistication, there are 2 things I would call out. One is the elevation of casual looks, right? And this is clearly driving newness in our assortment. To give you a specific set of examples, cashmere hoodies, novelty and matching fleece, for example. And then the other element to call out here is items to wear outside of the house, right? Items to wear outside of the house during the day. So we're seeing a significant pickup in our sports coats, we're seeing significant pick up in our outerwear. And then elements to wear in the evening as people go out. Now that's a smaller part of our business, but it has an important halo effect overall. So those are evening gowns and tuxedos. We, based on where the consumer is and where the consumer is going, are uniquely positioned to serve this hybrid need and expectation. And as I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we expect this to continue, and I think this will be actually a really nice tailwind based on how we are positioned. Jane Nielsen : Great. Matt, just to answer the second part of your question, on what's changed since our last Investor Day when we had a low- to mid-single-digit growth algorithm. I would say the biggest change is that our business is now on a healthier base from which to grow. So at that time, we still had daigou that we had to address. We weren't to where we wanted to be strategically in off-price. We knew we had some wholesale cleanup to do, and that work is done. We also were very nascent in our pricing journey. So what's different today is that we have proven our pricing capabilities across all 3 regions. At the time, we had Asia that we had a good proof case in, Europe was sort of early innings on that journey and North America was still to come. We now have confidence across our regions. And I think that, that underscores what's different as we think about the future, that North America is now positioned for growth. That's probably -- that's the biggest driver. And it's all -- you can always go stronger and faster with a [3-piston] engine. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Congrats on the momentum in the business. My question is for Jane on North America. I'm curious at what point you would expect to see unit growth again. And then if I can just follow up with Patrice on China. It definitely felt that, that region has been a positive outlier for you versus many other peers, particularly this earnings season. So curious if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the ground and just what that interplay is between physical traffic versus digital? Jane Nielsen : Yes, Erinn, thanks for the question. Taking a step back, we really expect our growth to come from AUR growth, as you noted, unit growth in targeted high-value areas. Over the past several years, we've been on a journey to restructure our business and really move away from low value, low AUR units and transition into higher value, higher AUR units. So our exiting of the lower wholesale doors, our licensing of Chaps, we really transitioned those units and are moving into units, like the elevated product assortments : sweaters, outerwear, sneakers, accessories, those denim, those higher-priced AUR units are where we are focused. As we look at North America, we're going to continue that journey. But we do see that we're growing units in our digital business. I think on our reset days, we'll be growing in -- we'll start to see some growth in the future in our wholesale business, especially as we've gained share, and we've had a couple of quarters of share gain in men's, kid's and women's, home and women's ready-to-wear. And we're very encouraged by the comp trends that we are seeing in our stores. And so we're confident about the future, but we're also confident in our strategy about growing units in high-value areas. Patrice Louvet : Erinn, so on China specifically, we've been really pleased with our continued performance in China. And as you know, this hasn't been just 1 quarter. We've been able to do this on a sustained basis. But including this past quarter, just as a refresher, up 22% versus LY, up 65% versus LLY despite Omicron disruption, right, which I think we're all in touch with. And I have to say the team on the ground is doing an awesome job navigating the volatility of Omicron in continuing to drive the brand. So we clearly see China both as a near-term opportunity and a long-term opportunity. From a brand perception standpoint, we track our brand equity on a monthly basis, and we see the brand continue to strengthen in that market, particularly with the younger population and nicely balanced from a gender standpoint, men's and women's. As we look at our business, digital versus physical, to your specific question, we really approach things through this key city ecosystem omnichannel lens, right? Shenzhen, Chengdu, Shanghai, Beijing is really where we're putting a lot of our emphasis. And we're building the ecosystem that has a strong digital wrapper, both RalphLauren.com, which we launched not that long ago and doing particularly well, and our key partners, Tmall, JD, WeChat as well, combined with the flagship presence that really projects brand image, as we've just done with the openings in Shanghai, in Beijing. And you heard in our prepared remarks, they're off to a really strong start across the board. So we've been really pleased with that. And then we are continuing to expand our store footprint beyond these flagships with these flexible Polo formats that are really performing quite well for us. So we're working hard to make sure all this is connected so that the consumer is at the center of it, it doesn't really matter whether it's digital or brick-and-mortar because fundamentally, what we want is to make sure we give that consumer an amazing experience. And we know he and she goes back and forth between these different channels. But I think we're really well positioned, and we have a very deliberate strategic approach to driving our expansion in that market. What I particularly like as well, and we've been talking a lot of AUR since the beginning of this call, is the elevation of the brand and the brand desirability in that market. And if you look at the data, China is probably one of those markets where the brand perception is the highest. So one, that gives us a lot of confidence in the near and long term for us to win in that market, particularly because the team has done a nice job weaving the brand into the local fabric of the culture. And two, there are a lot of learnings that we pick up from China that we replicate outside. And what -- some of the things you've seen recently relative to North America has actually been inspired by our success in the Chinese market. So just to wrap, it's -- China is still small for us, which I view is good news, because that means a significant upside, right? Still, total China business is about mid-single digits for the company. When you look at some of our peers and the Chinese penetration of their business relative to ours, that gives us still a great deal of runway. And I think we're nicely positioned despite some of the volatility that we're seeing. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Let\u2019s go to the last question, please, Angela. Operator : Our final question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : You guys have talked about bringing more new customers to the brand several occasions. I'm kind of curious what those customers are buying? How are you hooking them into the brand? And I'm also curious what that younger customer wants from the brand, how that might be different from your older customer and how that might differ by geography. Patrice Louvet : Sure. Yes, we've been excited about the progress we've made in terms of bringing new customers, younger customers, higher basket size customers, less price-sensitive customers to the brand and also more balance between men and women. Paul, the headline thought is they actually buy a lineup that's pretty consistent with our historical customers. Probably the areas of differentiation are in sneakers, you would expect that, are in outerwear. We have the Polo Sport brand that we've relaunched and repositioned that is really getting fantastic traction with that younger customer. And they're obviously resonating really nicely with some of our innovation and product drops. You heard us give a few examples on some of what we're doing there. So I would say pretty consistent with some areas of strength, particularly tying actually to those high potential underdeveloped categories that we have recently been putting disproportionate emphasis on. All right. Well, listen, thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We look forward to sharing our full year and fourth quarter fiscal '22 results with you in late May, and then we'll have our Investor Day after that where we can provide you with perspective from a longer-term standpoint. Thank you for calling in. Stay safe, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Good morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2022 conference call.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full-year results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. This year's performance underscores the strength of our business and desirability of our brand around the world, with both strong loyalty among our existing consumer base and enabling new high-value consumer recruitment. Ralph and I are inspired everyday by our team's engagement, agility, and execution, which is driving this progress. As we enter fiscal '23, our consumer remains healthy and motivated to invest in the timeless quality products we have always stood for. While we consistently adapt to ever-changing macro developments, our strong brand momentum will continue to be supported by multiple engines of growth. These include, first, continuing to drive brand heat and desirability with increased marketing investment and a combination of iconic lifestyle campaigns and precision marketing. Second, leveraging our unique, multi-category lifestyle proposition to drive the mix of sophisticated and casual dressing consumers crave. As we look ahead, there remain significant opportunities for category expansion and continued product elevation. And third, rolling out key city ecosystem strategy, which integrates a brand-elevating, cohesive consumer experience across our touch points. Originally developed in Asia, we're still in the early innings of scaling this model across each of our regions, including North America. Within this ecosystem, we lead with digital commerce, which continues to represent a significant growth opportunity while already solidly accretive to every region's profitability. Woven into all of these engines of growth is our focus on delivering positive impact in the world, across citizenship, and sustainability. Our fourth quarter performance was a great example of the continued progress we're making across these priorities as we pivot to growth while maintaining our culture of productivity. Despite macro headwinds from COVID, the devastating war in Ukraine and significant inflationary pressures, we expanded operating margin and each of our regions reported strong double-digit top line growth fueled by digital. Let me take you through a few of our fourth quarter and fiscal '22 highlights across the strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation, from our iconic brand moments at the summer and Winter Olympics to our launches in gaming and the metaverse, consumers around the world are connecting more than ever to our brand positioning and product portfolio. We're also strengthening our relationships with higher-income consumers across both our new and existing consumer base. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter where we shifted a significant portion of this year's investments to drive brand desirability across a diverse range of activities. First, this March marked our celebratory return to the runway at New York's Museum of Modern Art, where our men's and women's fashion show immersed viewers in the world of Ralph Lauren, as only Ralph can. On stage and in the audience were faces familiar to the brand, including Janelle Mon\u00e1e; Gigi and Bella Hadid; Emily in Paris' Lily Collins; New York City Mayor, Eric Adams; and our newest fragrance ambassador, Angus Cloud; from the hit show Euphoria. As we continue to amplify our events globally, we delivered our most successful TikTok campaign ever around the show, with our largest growth in new followers on the platform this year. You may have seen our exciting partnership with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges this quarter, honoring the legacy of HBCUs and their contribution to the culture of American fashion. Inspired by the rich heritage and esteemed traditions of these two schools, this creative collaboration is just one example of our commitment to evolve how we portray the American dream in the stories we tell and the faces and creators we champion. The collection, conversation, and press surrounding this collection sparked strong consumer engagement and traffic to our North American digital flagship in the quarter. And we continued to strengthen our leadership in the world of sports through our high-visibility sponsorships of the Australian Open and Team USA at the Winter Olympics. This year's events were particularly thrilling as we celebrated the spirit of optimism and aspiration that these sports represent consistent with our brand values. These activations not only drove another quarter of strong top line growth, but also helped recruit younger, full-price consumers to the brand, particularly on our digital channels. New consumers on our digital sites grew more than 70% to LLY, including an increased penetration of under 35 higher-value consumers. Our online search trends also grew double digits to last year in Q4, significantly outperforming peers globally. Looking to fiscal '23, we will continue to drive this momentum and desirability with iconic brand moments in sports and culture across our portfolio, all of which you will see amplified across our global campaigns. Touching on our second key initiatives, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph Lauren is one of the few brands in the marketplace with the authenticity, [Technical Difficulty], and credibility to deliver products across a range of lifestyle categories. As Ralph likes to say, the brand is not about chasing fast trends, but rather about living. And I can't think of a moment where this has been more relevant as consumers come together again with a return to pre-pandemic activities. Our design team is leveraging the breadth of our portfolio to create products that our consumers can live in and feel confident in regardless of what the new normal looks like for them. In the fourth quarter, consumers gravitated back to more sophisticated, luxury, and formalwear looks, while we also continued to drive a mix of elevated, but comfortable casual styles. As we continue to drive brand heat and new consumer acquisition, special collections this quarter included the Polo Color Shop, our pre-Spring ode to the easy luxurious style of the C\u00f4te d'Azur; our Morehouse and Spelman Colleges Collection, which sold out almost immediately; our Team USA Olympic styles featuring Intelligent Insulation technology and inspiring our next generation of outerwear; and our Lunar New Year gifting celebrating the Year of the Tiger. We were also proud to open our first iconic World of Ralph Lauren home shop at Harrods this quarter, with more to come as we build on this high-potential category. And in April, we launched our first unisex fragrance, Polo Earth, with consciously designed vegan fragrance featuring sustainably sourced ingredients and recycled packaging. Shifting gears to our third key initiative; drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued our long-term strategy of investing in our key city ecosystems around the world in fiscal '22, with a focus on elevating our touch points with the consumer across every channel. During the year, we opened 122 new stores and concessions in top cities globally. This fiscal year marked our first emblematic concept stores in China, in Beijing and Shanghai, our first European flagship opening, since 2010, in Milan, and our first slate of full-priced North America store openings since 2016. The vast majority of our store openings continue to be in Asia, and particularly the Chinese Mainland, where our brand momentum remained strong despite recurring COVID lockdowns. Our fourth quarter Mainland sales were still up more than 25% to last year in constant currency. And our Lunar New Year performance across the market significantly outpaced the competition as we continue to build our brand for a local audience. We further expanded our successful key city ecosystem model to other markets around the world this quarter. In North America, we just opened one new full-price store in Century City, Los Angeles, and relocated one store in Bal Harbour, Miami, for a total of eight new full-price openings this fiscal year. Overall, coming out of fiscal '22, we are strongly encouraged that North America's turnaround is well underway as we fire on all cylinders following our final phase of major distribution resets over the past year. Moving to our priority of leading with digital, sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players, and social commerce grew low double digits in the fourth quarter, a more than 80% to LLY in constant currency. For the full-year, digital grew more than 40% to last year, and 65% to LLY, reaching 26% of total revenue. This is consistent with our penetration levels during the heights of COVID, when store were closed. Within our own Ralph Lauren digital sites, sales grew 18% in the fourth quarter, and more than 70% to LLY. We continue to drive strong full-price selling as we deliver the right mix of product and invest in AI-powered targeting and new full price consumer acquisition. We also launched new localized digital commerce sites to support our ecosystem expansion globally. This includes our first digital flagship in Australia and the Middle East as well as 15 new ship-to destination largely across broader Europe. During the year, we expanded on the connected retail capabilities we launched during the pandemic, from virtual selling appointments to endless aisle product availability. Looking ahead, we will focus on scaling these capabilities along with our full catalog mobile app launched this past holiday to provide our consumers with a seamless elevated brand experience across every touch point and our entire portfolio. Moving to our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth, our teams have operated with incredible agility to mitigate emerging macro challenges, delivering both growth and operating margin expansion again in the fourth quarter despite increased cost headwind. In addition to implementing a culture of operating discipline across our company, over the last 24 months we have driven further efficiencies in how we operate. From the launch of digital product design and virtual showrooms to digitizing our supply chain in order to enable real-time visibility and planning, we also continue to make significant strides across our global citizenship and sustainability commitment over the past quarter and fiscal year. Let me highlight a few high impact initiatives, meaningfully progressing towards our target of at least 20% under represented race and ethnic groups on our global leadership team by 2023. Delivering $2 million donation in scholarship for students at historically black colleges and universities through their Ralph Lauren Foundation, launching the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund to support long-term sustainable cotton production in the U.S., unveiling color on demand, the world's first scalable zero waste water cotton dyeing system, and bringing to market CLARUS, a first-to-market patented technology and critical step in scaling our use of recycled cotton. And recall that in fiscal '22, we incorporated key ESG metric into our executive compensation plan for the first time. In closing, this year has been an exciting chapter on our journey to elevate our brands and pivot to offense. Ralph and I are proud of and encouraged by the passion, collaboration, and execution of our team. Together we have fundamentally repositioned our business and are already starting to yield positive results across our multiple engines of growth. Looking ahead, we have strong confidence in this growth model. And we'll continue to invest behind this year's momentum to deliver long-term value creation. We remain keenly focused on what we can control while continuing to navigate in uncertain global environment. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day on September 19. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results. And, I will join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We closed our fiscal '22 with strong fourth quarter and full-year results that demonstrated meaningful progress toward our next great chapter goal along with execution excellence by our teams and broad-based performance across our business. All three regions are back to top line growth. Our revenues are now slightly ahead of pre-pandemic level. And our operating profit dollars are also 30% higher all while ramping up investments and marketing, digital, new stores, and people. Compared to two years ago, our businesses are over 25% bigger in Asia, nearly 10% bigger in Europe, and North America is reset and delivering growth on a much healthier foundation. At the same time, our balance sheet enabled us to return significant excess cash to shareholder in line with our capital allocation principle. And we resumed our quarterly dividend and share repurchases this year. With the reset behind us, we are driving multiple growth engines across our brands, channels, and geography that will not only deliver more sustainable growth but also help to mitigate ongoing macro challenges. Let me take you through our fourth quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues increased 18% to last year on a reported basis, and 22% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in every region. This includes roughly five points of negative impact from our deliberate North America resets last year. Revenues exceeded both our fiscal '19 and '20 pre-pandemic results despite the resets. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew low double-digits in constant currency on top of the challenging compare of more than 60% growth last year. Our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites grew 18%, reflecting our strong product assortments, new consumer acquisition, expanded connected retail capabilities, and high-impact marketing. Digital margins remain strongly accretive to our profitability again this quarter. Total company adjusted gross margin was 63.3%, up 40 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 120 basis points in constant currency as we continue to successfully mitigate a dynamic inflationary environment. Fourth quarter AUR was up 13% on top of 31% growth last year, with growth across every region. This strong AUR growth along with favorable channel and geographic mix, more than offset higher than expected ocean freight costs with steep increases in oil prices following the evasion of Ukraine. We expect higher freight raw material and labor costs to remain elevated into fiscal '23. Particularly in the first-half until we start to lap higher cost increases in the second-half of the year. We plan to leverage our multi-pronged elevation strategy to continue driving AUR significantly above our long-term targets in order to mitigate mid-to-high single-digit product cost inflation in fiscal '23. Adjusted operating margin of 3.6% expanded 20 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 140 basis points in constant currency driven by continued operating discipline. Adjusted operating expenses increased 19% to 59.8% of sales, up 30 basis points on a reported basis, but down 20 basis points in constant currency. Marketing grew 48% to 9.5% of sales in the fourth quarter. We shifted a significant portion of our marketing investment from the first-half to the second-half of the year, as planned to accelerate our brand momentum and direct-to-consumer expansion coming out of the pandemic. Full-year marketing was 7.3% of sales, in line with our guidance. For fiscal '23, we still expect marketing of about 6% to 7% of sales. As we continue to support our new digital site, mobile apps, content creation, new consumer acquisition, and key brand moments, also drive desirability and purchase intent. Moving to segment portfolio; starting with North America, the regions turnaround continuous with fourth quarter revenues, up 19%. These results included a 13-point headwind from our strategic distribution reset and license of chaps implying strong underlying growth. In North America retail, comps increased 21% to last year. Growth was driven by improved traffic, transactions and 19% AUR growth on top of 30% last year, reflecting our continued elevation around product mix, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Brick and mortar comps grew 19% driven by double-digit growth in AUR, basket sizes, traffic, and conversion. Performance was strong in both our full price and factory stores on growing domestic demand, even as foreign tourism remains muted. We drove further momentum in our own digital commerce business this quarter with comps up 27% on top of 25% growth last year. Our continued focus on high-value, new consumer acquisition helped deliver growth in AUR and basket sizes, while further reducing our discount rates. In North America, wholesale revenues increased 1% to last year, slightly above our expectations. These results included 25 points of negative impact from our deliberate reset and chaps. Underlying growth and quality of sales continued to exceed our expectations. This was led by our full price businesses with sell out growth of more than 20% to last year, and 45% to LLY. We drove continued market share gains in Men's and kids in our key partners along with three consecutive quarters of gains in women's ready to wear. Our wholesale AUR was also up more than 25% to last year, as we elevated our assortments and pulled back on seasonal promotions. As we close out fiscal '22, we are very encouraged by our strong foundation and broad based momentum across North America, setting the path for long-term future growth. Moving on to Europe, fourth quarter revenue increased 26% on a reported basis and 34% in constant currency, retail comps increased 77% led by triple digit comps in brick-and-mortar stores. While we experienced Omicron related disruptions in the first few weeks of the quarter, it was a significant improvement from the prior-year period, when roughly 50% of our physical stores were closed due to COVID. Digital commerce comps declined slightly on top of an outsized 79% comp last year, when the widespread store closures shifted a disproportionate share of business online. We expect growth in both owned and wholesale digital in fiscal '23 driven by further site expansion and our healthy partnerships, despite strong compares. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter up 5% on a reported basis, and 12% in constant currency on top of a 41% reported growth last year, driven by stronger sell out and reorder trends. In the fourth quarter, we suspended our wholesale shipments to Russia and also paused operations in Ukraine given the devastating events unfolding there. Combined, these markets represented less than 1% of company sales prior to the war. We're not assuming any sales to these countries in our fiscal '23 outlook. While Europe remains our most dynamic market heading into fiscal '23, due to macro pressures and the war, our business remains fundamentally healthy, our consumers are resilient, and our teams continue to execute with agility. Turning to Asia, full-year fiscal '22 represents our highest ever revenue and operating profit for the region. Combined with five consecutive years of AUR growth, and the highest AURs in the company, Asia gives us strong confidence in the brand elevating ecosystem model we implemented over four years ago. These results in the midst of ongoing COVID impacts are especially strong and are testament to the outstanding work of our teams. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 20% on a reported basis and 26% in constant currency. Asia retail comps grew 12% with digital commerce increasing 46% and brick-and-mortar stores up 10%. We maintain strong momentum across our total digital ecosystem in the region, with more than 50% growth this quarter. This was supported by gains across our own sites and wholesale digital businesses. All of our key markets in Asia increased double-digits in constant currency this quarter, led by 45% growth in Korea. And despite COVID related disruptions, our Chinese Mainland sales grew 27% while Japan sales increased 17% to last year. Both markets accelerated sequentially despite stricter containment measures across our top cities, roughly 40% of our own stores in China experienced some form of closure or operating restrictions late in this quarter. Overall, we continue to see meaningful near and long-term growth opportunities for our business in China, where our brands are resonating with consumers and the underlying health of our business remain strong. While we are still navigating COVID disruptions, particularly in China, continued momentum across Japan, Korea and Australia are helping to offset these near-term headwinds. Moving on to the balance sheet, our strong balance sheet continues to be a competitive advantage, that gives us the flexibility to balance strategic investments with returning cash to shareholders, and opportunistic M&A, even through these dynamic times. This year, we returned approximately $600 million in dividends and share repurchases and ended the year with $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in total debt. This compares to $2.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, and $1.6 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 29% to support continued strong demand coming out of the pandemic, a deliberate increase in goods and transit, as we take inventory earlier to help mitigate supply chain delays, particularly in wholesale, increased product costs including freight and cotton, which we will start to lap in the second-half of fiscal '23 and continued elevation of our product mix. We are managing inventory carefully in this dynamic environment in order to satisfy growing consumer demand and to maintain our long-term growth and quality of sales trajectory. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, including disruptions from inflationary pressures, the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in Ukraine. For fiscal '23, we expect constant currency revenues to increase high single-digits with our current outlook at about 8% versus fiscal '22 on a 52-week comparable basis. Based on current spot rates, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points. Last year's 53rd week negatively impacts fiscal '23 growth by about 100 basis points in constant currency in addition to the headwind from foreign currency impact. We currently expect all three regions to drive positive revenue growth this year, with the largest dollar contribution from North America and highest growth rate in Asia. Our top line outlook also includes significant foreign currency headwinds primarily related to the Euro and the Japanese Yen, especially in the first-half of the year, potentially softer consumer sentiment in Europe from inflationary headwinds and the war with no sales to Russia or Ukraine assumed this year. COVID impacts notably in China, where we expect key city lock downs to continue through the first quarter of fiscal '23 and a limited contribution from foreign tourist sales. We expect operating margin in the range of 14% to 14.5% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 130 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis, and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis. Gross margin is expected to increase 30 to 50 basis points on a constant currency 52-week basis in line with our long-term plan. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product and channel mix more than offsetting increased freight and material costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by approximately 110 basis points in fiscal '23. We expect first-half gross margins to be lower with the highest freight pressures in Q2 followed by gross margin expansion in the second-half of the year as we start to lap the significant increases in freight and raw material costs. For the first quarter, we expect revenue growth in a range centered around 8% in constant currency, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 480 to 500 basis points. Our first quarter outlook reflects known COVID related restrictions, notably in China. We expect first quarter operating margin in a range centered around 13.5% in constant currency, reflecting increased headwinds from higher freight and marketing expense, which are expected to normalize in the second-half of the year as we start to lap cost increases from the prior-year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 130 basis points in the quarter. First quarter gross margin is expected to contract slightly to last year in constant currency with strong AUR growth more than offset by increased freight and product costs along with more normalized channel mix compared to last year store closures. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 100 basis points in the first quarter. We expect our tax rates in the range of 25% to 26% for the full-year, and 24% to 25% for the first quarter. Lastly, our capital allocation priorities remain largely unchanged, with a focus on reinvesting behind our key strategic initiatives and returning excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. We completed approximately $150 million in share buybacks in the fourth quarter, with $1.6 billion remaining on our current authorization and we recently raised our dividend for fiscal '23 by 9% to $3 per share. We're planning fiscal '23 capital expenditures of approximately $290 million to $310 million, or around 4% to 5% of sales. In closing, our teams around the world continue to execute with agility to drive brand desirability, and deliver growth across multiple levers all while navigating a still volatile global environment. Our strong performance this year underscores the timelessness of Ralph's creative vision, our strengthening consumer base and the power of our brand. As we accelerate our top line momentum, we remain strongly committed to balancing our pivot to offense with long-term profitability, leveraging our culture of operating discipline that has been embedded across our organization over the last four years. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter. Patrice Louvet : Thanks, Matt. Matthew Boss : So, Patrice, with the macro backdrop having changed across many of your key markets, since the February call, I guess what gives you confidence entering FY'23 to continue your pivot to offense despite the tougher backdrop, maybe what structural changes support your pricing structure? And can you touch on the total addressable market for refined casual exiting the pandemic and how you see the Polo brand position? Patrice Louvet : Sure. Well, good morning, Matt. Few things I would call out here, first of all, I think as all of you know, we significantly repositioned our company over the past couple of years, right? And we're coming into this new fiscal year with strong momentum. We now have multiple engines of growth, and we're delivering growth across every brand, every channel, every region, with opportunities for continued acceleration across each of them. So, our game plan is working. And I believe our deep brand strength, our demonstrated pricing power, and more diversified growth strategy becomes even more important during these turbulent times. There are few things I would call out. One, our consumer remains strong around the world, all right? And as we recruit new consumers, you saw this past quarter, we recruited 1 million new consumers, 5 million over the past fiscal year. We've been fundamentally pivoting our base towards higher-value full-price consumers who are less promotion/price sensitive. Second, as we've talked in prior calls, our designers and our merchants have been spot-on with this post-pandemic style of dressing and our products are driving desirability as they leverage the full breadth of our lifestyle portfolio. Third, our supply chain is built to be flexible and resilient. There's been a lot of work that's gone on over the past two, three years to get us there. And we now have proven our agility over the past couple of years, and I think I have a lot of confidence going into the continued turbulent environment. And then lastly, we've built a culture of cost discipline in the company, and we continue to drive value through productivity as well. So, listen, of course, we're grounded in reality and we're tracking closely consumer sentiment, bigger cost headwinds, including FX as well as COVID trends, particularly what we're seeing in Asia right now. We're not immune to any of these, but in this context, we are in the strongest position we could be in terms of what we can control moving forward. Now, specifically on the space that we play in, and you know, we've been on the brand elevation journey now for multiple years, right, working to get closer to the luxury groups. And so as we look at the consumer in that space right now, and this is both a reflection of what we're seeing in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia; that consumer is strong, that consumer is engaged in our category. And we're actually seeing some really interesting things in terms of purchasing pattern. We're seeing a combination of reinvesting in the core -- core wardrobe, so think of sweaters, think of denim. And then we're also seeing the consumer pivot towards newness and sophistication, examples for us would be cashmere hoodie or a novelty fleece. And then, and I think this characterizes the broader population, consumers starting to go out during the day, so there's a need for a sports coat, there is a need for auto wear, there's a need for dresses, and then the return to social activities in the evening or on the weekends. So, that that whole space for us continues to be healthy, continues to grow. And if anything, we're actually very energized by the diversity of the opportunities that we have as consumers pivot their apparel needs in this kind of new normal. Polo, within that, which is at the heart of our company, is actually really in a sweet spot when it comes to serving these needs nicely and competitively. And that's both the combination of our very strong core products, right, that's really a foundation for this company is our core propositions. And obviously, as I mentioned earlier, that taps into consumers reinvesting in their core. And then also, we're seeing some really nice elevation and innovation across a number of different categories within the Polo brand, whether that's Polo women's, with all the wonderful work that the team is doing on dresses, for example, or broader propositions, and all the work that our Polo men's and our Polo kids teams are also doing to serve this more elevated, more sophisticated consumer need right now. So, we actually think, well, the Polo brand is really well-positioned within this total addressable market and from everything we're seeing so far in market, consumer healthy and strong in that space. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys, thanks for all the detail here. Want to ask you two quick ones. I guess you seem to be against the trend here with your guidance of constant currency expansion for both gross and operating margins this year. Given the macro backdrop, what gives you confidence in your current margins and their sustainability? And then as a follow-up, on the North America wholesale business, I know you said that it was a plan of 1%, including the 53rd week. I know you've done a lot of work there. It does seem like that channel is still holding back the model a little bit relative to the other channels growing a lot faster. And Jane, I thought it was interesting that it was up 1%. You said POS was up 20%. I think North America wholesale was up 21% on a two-year basis, and POS was up 45%. So, there's just a big gap that keeps rolling forward with North America wholesale. How do we think about that growth rate in '23? Is it mid single-digit to sustain the 8% constant currency revenue growth, maybe some thoughts there to help us understand how North America is positioned for the year? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. Let me start with the first, about our guidance. We are comfortable with our fiscal '23 guidance at this point. Our momentum and our track record of expanding both our gross margins and our operating margins through our Next Great Chapter plan are really a strong foundation for our fiscal '23 guidance. And as you saw, our business trends are good. Now, clearly, we're watching the macro headwinds very carefully. So, as we thought about our guidance, particularly in gross margins and in operating margins, we really tried to take a balanced approach, balancing both risks and opportunities that we saw and we tried to do this across our guidance. We are encouraged as we look ahead. And let me give you a few reasons why. First, our consumers are resilient. They're at the higher end of income demographics, and they've proven, through COVID that their desire for the brand has increased and that they've come back repeatedly. Second, our value perception, our quality score, and our purchase intent have strengthened through the pandemic, even with the backdrop of us taking pricing up 50% over the last two years. So, quality, value, and purchase intent all up in the face of that kind of pricing; that gives us tremendous confidence. And third, we are maintaining new consumer acquisition momentum of younger and higher-quality consumers through this journey, and we intend to continue that and investing in that. And that's a very important part of our gross margin journey. And then finally, our team, obviously, they've managed through disruptions and headwinds, and have done so with great agility. And we have confidence in our ability to navigate the macro headwinds doing that. We're confident in these drivers to expand our gross margins this year and beyond, and feel that we're on a very solid ground to achieve our mid-teens operating margin, that's our longer-term goal. And feel that this year will put us a step closer to getting to that goal. Now, on North America wholesale, what you've seen, in up 1% in terms of overall, there is about 20 points of headwind from Chaps in that number. So you will recall, Michael, that we took Chaps out of our owned and operating model and we moved it to a license model, that impact is sitting on North American wholesale growth. Without that impact, we would have been up mid-20%. Now, that is going to continue. We lap out of that transition in August, and there is about $17 million of revenue in the first-half of fiscal '23. So, you will see that continue, but we expect the underlying growth in wholesale to be quite healthy, and we're very encouraged by the progress that we're making there, but you will see that in the first-half of fiscal '23. Patrice Louvet : Yes, you look -- you see, Michael, through our share performance, I think, a truer reflection of how we're doing in that channel. And actually, we're really pleased with, one, the partnerships that we've built with our key wholesale partners and, two, the momentum that we have from a consumer voting standpoint, which is really what share measure is all about. And we're growing share in men's meaningfully, we're growing share in kids, we're growing share in home. We're now growing share in women's ready-to-wear, three quarters in a row of share growth in women's ready-to-wear, excited about the progress both on Polo women's and on Lauren, in particular. So, fundamentally, to your point on where does this stack up relative to our growth drivers in North America, we think wholesale is actually very nicely positioned, now that it's been reset, and we're certainly seeing the consumers vote very clearly in favor of our brands. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Patrice Louvet : Morning. Omar Saad : Great numbers on the digital side, you have a lot of momentum in that channel. Maybe you could elaborate on that integrated market digital strategy that you talked about earlier on, developed with China, rolling it out to other markets. Maybe you could talk about how it operates? Why it's so effective? And where you think the biggest opportunities are in that owned digital channel? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So, our go-to-market approach is really characterized by the ecosystem lens. And we focus on our top three cities, and there we work hard to make sure we have the right brick and mortar and digital representation. And exactly to your point, we want the consumer to have a completely seamless experience, whether they're shopping online, on our app on our sites, or whether they're actually in our stores. What we have seen, and to some extent, COVID has been an enabler for that, the COVID crisis has been enabled for that, there's an acceleration of our connected retail capabilities, and there are ranges from digital clienteling, which is now ingrained in the way our teams work. So, the seamless connection between the store and the Web site for example, we have Boris, you're familiar with BOPIS, which is Buy Online Pick-up In Store, now we also have buy online return in-store. So, that's very seamless experience for the consumer. We've introduced the app a few months ago, which is also nicely connected to consumers purchase history. So, we're able to tell for those who are comfortable sharing that data, what's in your closet, and therefore we can use that data for really targeted one-to-one marketing to serve you in the way that fits best your shopping patterns. And then, we've recently introduced something I'm very excited about, which are endless aisle, actually screens in our brick and mortar stores, where even from a 1,000 square foot store you can now shop every element of the Ralph Lauren line. And we started to experiment with that in North America, and in several stores we're seeing very positive results. And it further gets to your point, Omar, of no longer really segmenting, this is brick and mortar, and this is digital, but for it to be a completely connected experience. Certainly our experience in Beijing and Sanlitun with the work that we've done with Tencent has also reinforced that leveraging, you know, the local kind of WeChat mini programs as a way to connect the consumer to our brick and mortar operations. But I think what you'll continue to see from us is a ramp up of these capabilities. And then, there's we stay in touch with what the consumer is looking for and we adjust our offerings and our experiences accordingly, but I feel very good about the momentum we have in digital across the company. And I think our penetration right now is about 26% of total revenue is digital. We've seen that hold up nicely as the stores have reopened. So, feel good about the sustainability of that, and our ambition is to make that over 30%. But again, the consumer should have absolutely seamless experience, and more and more a personalized experience. Jane Nielsen : And Omar, on your question about local sites, we opened up 20 local sites this quarter. They tend to be smaller markets. We opened North Africa, the Middle East, some larger markets; Australia, and Korea were also local sites that we opened this quarter. It was one of our key investments as we exited the second-half of this year and will continue as we move into next year. So, we're very pleased with our ability to reach digitally new markets in local language and local shift to addresses and we think that's going to be a very positive driver as we move forward. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. Patrice and Jane, I appreciate you guys call three regions to drive positive revenue growth for FY'23. Jane, I think you mentioned that the largest dollar contribution should be from North America and the highest growth rate should come from Asia. Is it fair to assume that North America should grow about mid single-digit rate, Asia should grow low double-digit rate? And if that's the case, what is embedded in your Asia assumption for China growth this year. Jane Nielsen : So, we don't guide our regions exclusively, but we think that North America is positioned for strong growth as we move forward. We are very pleased about North America becoming an engine of growth. We expect Asia to be driven by the reopening of Japan, which would have significant market shutdowns through this year. And also China, while we contemplated the shutdowns in Shanghai and some of the key cities for Q1, which are material, Shanghai alone is 40% of our China business. We still expect strong double-digit growth as we exit the year, this year for China. We've seen China being very resilient through COVID. Our consumer scores there are some of the highest we have around the world, and we have seen very strong continued digital momentum even store comps have come back. So, we are very bullish about our China business. You saw it very sequentially strengthened this quarter. We are realistic about the impact of the shutdowns, but we have contemplated that for Q1, and still expect strong double-digit growth in China. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Bob Drbul : Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if you could spend a little more time on the inventories either by region or how much in terms of in-transit is impacting it. Just curious in terms of like how you are planning mainly the European market with the orders on a wholesale basis. And I guess the second question would be around that same topic. But from the perspective of like late shipments to wholesale, I think you said supply chain was really impacting all your wholesale inventory. Has there been any change in your retail partners' willingness to take product whenever it comes even if it is late or miss shipping windows? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thanks for the question, Bob. You saw our inventory increase in the fourth quarter. That was two factors. One, over the past three quarters, our sales numbers has significantly exceeded our inventory growth numbers. And so, this quarter we move to reset some of our inventory level. In addition and as I think as we've talked about, we made a move to take inventory earlier, especially for our wholesale account. And so, to address the challenge that you said, we want to maximize full price selling in our wholesalers. And so, you've seen us take inventories earlier. And hold it longer due to some of the supply chain delays that we are still experiencing and expect to experience through the first few quarters of this year. We have seen great partnership with our retailers. They are appreciative of our moves to secure their inventory and supply. And we feel great about our wholesale inventories. While they were up 16% this quarter, our sell out was up almost mid 20%, so, very healthy inventory, and no resistance at all in terms of taking our assortments and truly great partners in terms of our move to secure inventory for them. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Great. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Thanks so much. Just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on your plans for the balance sheet for this upcoming year. And what your plans are for the free cash flow after you invest within the business? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thanks for the question, Jay. As we look at our capital allocation priority, it really hasn't change. So, number one is to invest in our business. And you saw -- take our CapEx up largely for growth-oriented initiatives, new stores. We are planning to open 200 new stores this year, which is a big step up from this year. We opened about 122. Digital infrastructure is an area of investment. And we feel great about digitizing our supply chain which is an important productive initiative. So, we are investing in our business and that's our first priority. From a balance sheet capital allocation perspective, first take up our dividend 9%, and we are committed to returning excess free cash flow to shareholders. We repurchased about $450 million of shares last year. We still have 1.6 remaining on our authorization. And expect to be able to continue -- returning excess cash to shareholders through this year about the same level you saw us do last year. So, we are encouraged by the health of our balance sheet. And we are encourage by our opportunity to invest in our business. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Let's go to the last question please, Angela. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. Chris Nardone : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk a little bit more about the outlook for underlying sales growth in Europe ex-FX? In particular, are you seeing any cracks in consumer sentiment or any spending patterns in Western Europe markets? Jane Nielsen : Yes. So, we are encouraged by the underlying growth of our Europe business as we moved forward. The biggest impact that we see is FX. While we did see some pullback in Q4 with the war in the Ukraine, we are seeing consumers subsequently respond well and see nice traffic into our stores. So, we are encouraged by the European consumer. The underlying growth we expect to be consistent with our long-term guidance which was in the mid single digit range. And we expect Europe to be in that range this year -- mid to high single digit range this year. And we've fully contemplated some of the impact of the Ukraine war and impact to European sentiment in their guidance. It was about 1% of sale when we stopped shipment to Russia and Ukraine, and probably another percent in terms of overall overhang of the war to consumer sentiment. Patrice Louvet : And we are seeing this growth actually to be broad-based, right, so, 34% constant currency up in Q4 for total Europe. Both particularly driven by the U.K., by Germany, by Italy where we recently invested in our ecosystems in the [long] [Ph], so pretty well diversified growth, and for our earlier conversation, I think at this point we are feeling that the consumers that we appeal to is in good place in Europe. All right, thank you for your question, Chris. Patrice Louvet : Well, listen, thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our first quarter fiscal '22 results with you in August. In the meantime, stay safe and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Our strong first quarter performance underscores the resilience and momentum of our business around the world. This follows our significant multiyear reset to transform our consumer base, product portfolio and distribution. These results also validate the strong confidence that Ralph and I have in our teams who are consistently executing with incredible dedication and agility through what continues to be uncertain times. We exceeded our expectations again on both the top and bottom line with broad-based strength across all 3 regions despite macro headwinds from COVID and inflationary pressures in the quarter. Our teams are driving increasing desirability for our brands and products enabling high-quality consumer recruitment as well as retention.  Our proven ability to drive a strong value proposition for our consumer, which has strengthened over the last 4 years of our strategic plan is an important advantage for Ralph Lauren, especially through times of macro uncertainty. We are obviously highly attentive to the volatility highlighted recently by our retail peers across the price spectrum. And while we are not immune to broader macro headwinds, we remain focused on what we can control. We have many areas of strength that include a powerful, differentiated brand that we continue to invest in, a strong core business that is resilient through challenging cycles, a more flexible expense structure, a diversified global supply chain with proven agility and discipline in our inventory management and a robust balance sheet, which enables us to make the right decisions for the long-term health of our business.  And while we continue to adapt to shifting macro developments, this strong foundation gives us confidence as we drive our business across multiple engines of long-term growth. These include : first, continuing to drive brand heat and desirability; second, leveraging our luxury halo and unique multi-category lifestyle proposition, where we can dial certain product categories up or down as consumer needs evolve; and third, rolling out our ecosystem strategy led by digital.  We are balancing these priorities with our ongoing focus on productivity, an important driver to fuel our top and bottom line growth and spanning everything we do is our commitment to deliver positive impact in the world across citizenship and sustainability.  Our first quarter performance was a strong example of our progress across each of these areas. Let me take you through a few of our first quarter highlights across the strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. In the current operating environment, we remain focused on investing in our brand to deliver a clear, differentiated message to our target consumers. Our multifaceted marketing strategy is focused on leveraging our core brand values to connect authentically with consumers, strengthening existing relationships and recruiting new and younger high-value consumers around the world.  This was particularly evident in the first quarter where we continue to focus our investments on driving brand desirability across a diverse range of activities. First, we kicked off the 50th anniversary celebration of our iconic Polo shirt this spring with a 360-degree campaign and book launch across our stores, social media and celebrity moments, which we amplified globally. While our business is so much more than a Polo shirt, this icon is a testament to the unique emotional connection consumers have with our brand across ages, genders and geographies.  You may have seen our dynamic billboards in the heart of Seoul, Paris, London and L.A. We also launched a limited edition vintage Polo collection in stores and our latest sustainable Earth Polo.  We invited our fans throughout the world to share touching personal stories about their memories with the Polo shirt on social media. As consumers increasingly value brands that are timeless and authentic, we continue to weave Ralph Lauren into the fabric of modern culture around the world.  Similarly, we celebrated the optimism and perseverance of sport through our 17th annual sponsorship of the Wimbledon Championships. Inspired by our timeless spectator style, this year's new uniforms combine the heritage of our brand with modern silhouettes and fabrications, including the use of recycled materials. And we continue to capture key brand moments that resonate with fashion lovers around the world, including our Gilded Glamour dressing at this year's Met Gala.  Friends of the brand like Alicia Keys and her showstopping to the New York City skyline with , Ryan Reynolds and Jay Balvin channeling old Hollywood and the always daring were all featured in our brand. These activations attracted younger full-price consumers to our business driving another quarter of strong top line growth.  New consumers on our digital sites grew nearly 70% to pre-pandemic levels. And our online search trends grew high teens to last year in Q1, led by our Polo shirt and spring luxury campaigns, significantly outperforming our peers globally.  Touching on our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph and our design teams continue to deliver the products consumers are craving in this moment, with broad-based strength across our range of luxury lifestyle categories. People are coming together again with a renewed appetite for style from a fresh approach to wear to work, to weddings and other social gatherings, our brand is uniquely positioned to capture this mix of sophisticated and casual dressing.  Product highlights this quarter included our global Polo shirt campaign, which drove strong performance across a range of styles from our core mesh to our seasonal prints and novelty offerings. This strong trend was reinforced by the introduction of our Upcycled Polo Shirts, celebrating the timeless quality and consumers' emotional connection to this iconic style.  Our Cobble Hill collection for Polo mens, which celebrates our sophisticated sportswear in the modern wardrobe. And our Athletic Club collection, bringing classic tennis and golf inspired styling to the next-generation was a standout for the season. With strong sales in lightweight sporting windbreakers, rugby shirts and fleece in classic combinations of white and dark green. From our clean summer whites to our colorful Classics, Ralph Lauren embodied the exuberance of a return to head-to-toe dressing at its best.  Shifting gears to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued our long-term strategy of investing in our key city ecosystems around the world in the first quarter, with a focus on elevating our touch points with the consumer across every channel.  During the quarter, we opened more than 60 new stores and concessions in top cities globally. Nearly all of our store openings were in Asia and notably the Chinese mainland, where our brand momentum and opportunities remain strong despite transitory COVID lockdowns. Following our first 2 emblematic store openings last year in Beijing and Shanghai, we opened a third emblematic concept in Chengdu, another key city cluster, which also included our first restaurant and bar in China, reinforcing our lifestyle offering in the market. And while roughly 50% of our China stores were negatively impacted by COVID closures in the quarter, driving Mainland sales down 10% to last year in constant currency, we continue to reinforce our elevated brand positioning in the market.  Our festival performance outpaced our closest peers by double digits, while we also increased our penetration of full-price sales. We remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory in China with strong brand momentum and an encouraging recovery in performance as COVID-related store restrictions were lifted in late June as expected. We continue to watch our key markets carefully, including the ongoing impact of COVID variants.  Moving to our priority of leading with digital. We have made significant progress over the last 4 years in repositioning our digital business, putting it on the path of strong margin-accretive growth that is outpacing total company growth. This progress is underscored by our recent ranking in the for 2022, where we were proud to rank #2 among 75 global luxury retailers, up from number 5 last year.  First quarter sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, grew mid-single digits in constant currency. This was on top of an exceptionally strong compare of more than 80% last year and about 85% growth in first quarter of fiscal '21.  Within our own Ralph Lauren digital sites, sales grew high single digits in the first quarter. We continue to drive strong full price selling as we deliver the right mix of products and invest in AI-powered targeting and high-quality new consumer acquisition.  We also launched new localized digital commerce sites to support our ecosystem expansion globally. This includes the 21 sites launched in Europe in fiscal '22 and new sites added in the first quarter in India and Israel. Our Asia digital ecosystem once again drove the fastest growth globally, over a smaller base, up more than 60% in constant currency to last year. This was led by triple-digit growth in Korea and 40% growth in China, where our digital businesses outperformed peers and the broader market despite disrupted supply chains in Shanghai and shipment restrictions on nonessential goods.  We were also encouraged by early performance in our Australia digital flagship, which we launched at the end of Q4.  Moving to our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our teams have operated with incredible agility to mitigate emerging macro challenges, delivering operating margins ahead of our expectations in the first quarter despite increased cost headwinds. In June, we published our timeless by design, global citizenship and sustainability report, outlining our commitments to address our impact. I encourage you all to download the report from our website, let me highlight a couple of exciting initiatives. First, we officially announced our first cradle-to-cradle certified product with our iconic luxury cashmere sweater launching later this fiscal year with more C2C products to come.  And we're kicking off our Live On Promise to enable our past and future products to live on responsibly by 2030. In addition, we were proud to recently be named one of Best Companies for Women to advance for the third year in a row as we further our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. In closing, our company has weathered a variety of macro environments over the last 55 years, not to mention the last 3, with our organization emerging stronger and more agile than ever before. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the passion and execution our teams have demonstrated throughout all while staying true to the values that have made this brand revered and emotionally connected since its inception. And I am confident that the healthy foundations we've put into place along with our multiple engines of growth will enable us to continue driving toward our commitments of long-term value creation.  As always, we remain keenly focused on what we can control, and are executing on our long-term strategic initiatives while continuing to navigate an uncertain global environment. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And before I turn it over to Jane, I'd like to welcome Deb Cupp, who joined our Board of Directors last week, currently the President of Microsoft North America, she will bring important perspective to our digital acceleration and more. Ralph and I would also like to thank Parting Director, , who has served on our Board since 2001, and for many years of leadership and dedication to the company.  With that, I'll hand it to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the broad-based strength of our strategic plan, the durability of our business model and the execution excellence of our teams in the face of challenges and disruptions around the world. Our pivot to offense showed in our top line growth with Q1 revenues up 8% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency, above pre-pandemic levels and more than 500 basis points above our outlook. This was supported by positive growth across all 3 regions, despite lapping our final quarter of major distribution resets and COVID-related shutdowns in China.  Operating profit dollars also grew versus pre-pandemic levels with continued operating expense discipline helping to mitigate transitory cost pressures. And we achieved all of this while continuing to drive important investments in marketing, digital, new stores and people.  We believe our elevated brand, focused strategy and targeted investments when combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress balance sheet gives us a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation through uncertain times. Let me take you through our first quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues, up 13% in constant currency, significantly outperformed our outlook. Results included roughly 4 points of negative impact from our divestiture of Club Monaco and licensing of our North American Chaps brand last year, implying even stronger underlying growth.  Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew mid-single digits in constant currency on top of more than 80% growth last year. Our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites grew high single digits on top of last year's 49% compare, reflecting our compelling product assortments, new consumer acquisition and user-friendly connected retail capabilities. Digital margins remain strongly accretive to our profitability in the quarter.  Total company adjusted gross margin was 68%, down 180 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 80 basis points in constant currency.  First quarter AUR was up 8% on top of 18% growth last year. Solid AUR momentum was more than offset by higher-than-anticipated freight spend, which helps support our strong spring on-time delivery rates and full price selling to deliver revenue outperformance in the quarter.  Compared to fiscal '20 pre-pandemic levels, gross margin was 350 basis points higher in the first quarter. We continue to expect freight raw materials and labor costs to pressure gross margins this year, particularly through Q2 until we start to lap higher cost increases in the second half of the year.  We plan to leverage our multipronged elevation strategy to continue driving AUR in order to mitigate mid- to high single-digit product cost inflation this year.  Adjusted operating margin was 12.7%, down 410 basis points on a reported basis and 270 basis points in constant currency as we normalize spending versus unusually low levels last year due to COVID. This was ahead of our outlook driven by strong operating expense discipline and productivity initiatives.  Adjusted operating expenses increased 13% to 55.2% of sales, including marketing expense growth of about 40% over last year's lower spend. Marketing was 7% of sales at the high end of our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. While we have built increased flexibility across our operating expense structure, we remain committed to investing in our brand, which is driving both near-term top line momentum and share gains as well as longer-term brand equity.  Moving to segment performance, starting with North America. The region's improved trajectory continues with first quarter revenues up 6%. These results included about 3 points of headwind from our licensing of Chaps, implying even stronger underlying growth. Q1 represents the final quarter of meaningful headwinds from our North America strategic resets.  In North America Retail, comps increased 5% to last year, led by double-digit growth in our full-price stores. Performance was driven by improved traffic, larger basket sizes and 12% AUR growth on top of 39% last year, reflecting our ongoing elevation around product mix, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Foreign tourist sales continued to show sequential improvement, but we're still below pre-pandemic levels.  Our premium position helped our outlet channel deliver positive comp growth in the quarter. However, growth was more modest than in our full-price business. We attribute this partially to higher cost pressures and weaker consumer sentiment among value-oriented shoppers across the marketplace.  We are rolling out a number of interventions. These include leveraging our AI-driven targeted communications, accelerating new ways of selling to support conversion, expediting shipments of core products that are selling well and more. We will continue to watch this channel carefully given ongoing macro headwinds and have embedded increased caution in our current fiscal '23 outlook. Comps in our owned RalphLauren.com site grew 2% on top of a strong 51% compared last year, supported by solid demand for our products and ability to retain newly acquired consumers. In North America Wholesale, revenues increased 5% to last year, significantly above our expectations. Results included about 8 points of negative impact from licensing Chaps. This outperformance was driven by our full-price wholesale business, reflecting our improved brand positioning in the channel.  Sellout grew mid-teens to last year on better-than-expected spring fill rates and enhanced marketing. Our AUR at wholesale also grew double digits to last year as we further elevated product, pull back promotions and increased targeted communications.  We are winning with the consumer with continued market share gains in men's, women's and kids in our key partners. Inventory growth was also broadly aligned with sellout.  While we are watching macro developments carefully, we continue to be strongly encouraged by our healthy foundation and broad-based momentum across North America, setting the path for long-term growth.  Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenues increased 17% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 34%, brick-and-mortar store comps grew 45% to last year when approximately 15% of our stores were closed, along with further heavy restrictions from the Delta variant. Digital commerce comps grew 7% on top of a 98% compare last year, when widespread COVID closures shifted a disproportionate share of business online.  Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency, driven by stronger fall bookings and fill rates, reorder trends and sustained growth with our digital pure plays.  Turning to Asia. Revenues increased 16% on a reported basis and 26% in constant currency. Asia retail comps grew 19% on top of a 43% compare last year, with digital commerce increasing 37% and brick-and-mortar stores up 17%. We maintained strong momentum across our total digital ecosystem in the region with more than 60% growth this quarter. This was supported by double-digit increases across our owned sites and wholesale digital businesses.  By market, first quarter sales in Japan improved sequentially to 32% in constant currency following last quarter's Omicron restrictions. This represents a double-digit increase to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '20. Strong momentum also continued in Korea, where sales grew 30% in the quarter. And both Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia grew double and triple digits in the period, respectively.  Our broad-based performance helped to offset strict COVID lockdowns in the Chinese Mainland this quarter, where total sales declined 10% in constant currency due to store closures. Based on our strong return to positive sales growth from late June onward, we remain optimistic about the resilience of the Chinese consumer and our continued brand momentum in the market. And while we continue to manage through COVID disruptions, including recent lockdowns in Macau and Hong Kong, our teams are driving offense across our other key markets to deliver strong double-digit growth.  Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. We also paid down $500 million in debt that matured in June to end the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. This compared to $3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year.  Net inventory increased 47%. Similar to the previous quarter, this growth is to support strong demand for our brand and products, a deliberate increase in goods in transit as we take inventory earlier to help mitigate supply chain delays, particularly in wholesale. Increased product costs, including freight and cotton, which we will start to lap in the second half of fiscal '23 and continued elevation of our product mix. Based on these trends, we expect inventory to remain at similar levels through holiday, becoming more closely aligned to sales by the end of the fiscal year. We are managing inventory very carefully in this dynamic environment. In order to satisfy robust consumer demand, while maintaining our long-term quality of sales trajectory. This includes leveraging our strong core and replenishment business, which has greater supply chain visibility and shorter lead times to effectively flex up or down as needed with demand as we did most recently through the pandemic.  Looking ahead, our outlook is based on the evolving macro environment, including inflationary pressures, disruptions in the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in the Ukraine. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios, and this guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impact. For fiscal '23, we are maintaining our full year outlook in constant currency with revenues expected to increase high single digits, centering on 8% on a 52-week comparable basis. Based on unfavorable spot rates, however, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 600 basis points. As a reminder, we still expect fiscal '23 growth to also be negatively impacted by about 100 basis points due to the absence of last year's 53rd week.  In addition to the factors we outlined last quarter, including FX, softer consumer sentiment in Europe and Q1 China COVID lockdowns, our updated full year outlook also incorporates increased caution around our value-oriented consumers in North America, notably the potential for softer traffic and conversion rates through the end of the year. That said, we are reiterating our full year revenue outlook based on our strong Q1 outperformance and diversified engines of growth. We still expect operating margin in the range of 14% to 14.5% in constant currency. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 180 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis.  Gross margin is still expected to increase 30 to 50 basis points on a constant currency 52-week basis. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product mix more than offsetting increased freight and material costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 150 basis points in fiscal '23.  We still expect gross margin contraction in the first half of the year due to increased freight pressures to meet demand. This is followed by gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we start to lap the significant input cost increases.  For the second quarter, we expect constant currency revenue growth in a range centering on 11%. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 750 basis points. We expect second quarter operating margin in the range of 15.4% to 15.7% in constant currency, reflecting increased headwinds from higher freight and marketing expense which are expected to normalize in the second half of the year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margins by about 240 basis points in the quarter.  Second quarter gross margin is expected to contract about 40 to 80 basis points in constant currency with further AUR growth more than offset by increased freight and product costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 190 basis points in the quarter.  We still expect our tax rate in the range of 25% to 26% for the full year and also for the second quarter. We continue to expect CapEx of about $290 million to $310 million.  In closing, we delivered another strong quarter inspired by Ralph's creative vision, coupled with the agility, dedication and relentless execution of our teams, all while continuing to navigate a volatile, global operating environment.  While staying grounded in the macro developments, we remain confident in our multiple engines of growth. We are laser-focused on what we can control : strengthening our consumer base; enhancing the desirability of our timeless brand; and maintaining operating discipline across our business.  And with that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Jay Sole with UBS Securities. Jay Sole : Great. My question is the global operating environment appears to be getting more challenging from inflation and weak consumer sentiment, just to a more intense promotional stance of some of your peers. So what gives you confidence that you are better positioned versus your peers to continue driving offense and deliver growth in this kind of environment and particularly in Europe? Patrice Louvet : Well, thank you for your question. Yes, it has been a more challenging operating environment. And as you heard us talk about in the prepared remarks, we do expect more choppiness ahead given the various macro signals. But we still have strong confidence in our game plan and our ability to navigate and execute successfully through this choppiness.  As you know well, we've been repositioning this company for the past 4 years to establish a very strong, broad foundation with multiple engines of growth ahead. And I will highlight 4 clear sustainable advantages. The first one is an iconic lifestyle brand. With consumer metrics like desirability that are improving in every market, as you know, we track our brand perception in our top 7 markets monthly and we continue to see strengthening across the board. And we have millions of consumers joining our brand every year. This past quarter, we had 1.3 million consumers join us on top of over 5 million last year.  The second element is the unique breadth of our product offering. We're really the only brand that can credibly offer categories from sneakers to tuxedos, which means we have the ability to dial up and dial down specific elements based on consumer demand and desire.  The third is a clear and regionally balanced go-to-market strategy so that even if one region is adversely affected, we're diversified across market and can offset in other parts of the world. And I think we've also proven our ability to rebound quickly as recently demonstrated again in China where you saw that we were able to deliver strong performance given half of our stores were closed for the majority of the quarter.  And the fourth area I would call out is a diversified and agile supply chain. There's been work that's been going on for the 5-plus years to really establish that. And that has proven to be both a huge asset and a major competitive advantage for us as we navigate this [indiscernible] world. And supporting all of this work, we have an organization that is engaged, that has fully embraced operational discipline, as you've seen with our continued margin expansion versus pre-pandemic levels.  So net-net, I would say we're staying in touch, of course, with what's happening. And while we're not immune to macro pressures, we are staying focused on the medium and long-term direction for the company.  If I had to sum up where our current position is in 3 words, I would say offense, agility and pragmatic. Offense, to maintain and fuel our momentum. Agility, as we face a continually volatile operating environment and pragmatic and choiceful about where we use our resources to ensure we continue to build our brand and our market position for the long term. Corinna Van Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : I guess one at higher level and then maybe one on the near-term. [indiscernible] Around guidance for the year, the top line and the bottom line despite the currency movements here. Maybe just some of the puts and takes around how you were able to hold the guidance on the top and the bottom.  And then I just want to circle up on -- Jane, it looks like you're bracing for a little bit tougher trend potentially in the North America outlets. Can you speak to what August looks like in direct-to-consumer or anything that's fueling your concerns? Are you seeing that slow down now? Or is it something you're just anticipating? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thanks, Michael. We were pleased with the performance this quarter, and it really helped us to maintain our full year constant currency guidance in the context of a lot of macro choppiness out there. And as you would expect, we're actively scenario planning around the consumer. And I'll get to your value consumer at the end. But I did want to just walk you through some of the puts and takes on the guide for fiscal '23. First, on the top line, really, our positive performance trends in international gave us some flexibility on the full year as both Europe and Asia came in stronger than we initially expected back in May. China was largely locked down, as Patrice mentioned, in Q1, but was offset by the strength in other countries, Korea, Japan and Australia, all performed extremely strongly through the quarter. So we were very pleased with that. And Europe also trended well despite the known political and consumer macro headwinds there. So we're pleased with Europe through the quarter and have been cautious entering the year. And while we see North America on a nice, healthy mid-single-digit growth trajectory, we are adding some additional caution around the value-oriented consumer. This really speaks to the inflationary headwinds and weaker consumer sentiment that's out there. We're not naive about what's happening to that consumer from a macro standpoint and wanted to make sure that we were building that in overall.  And I say that for the guidance, this all speaks to our diversified engines of growth and gives us confidence in continuing our strategy despite a more uncertain environment. And our margins, clearly, we're managing through cost inflation that we've communicated over the last several quarters. But there are some signs of relief on the horizon. I don't think they'll impact fiscal '23. But given we've got proven pricing strategies, we've reengineered many aspects of our cost structure, and we are laser focused on ROI. We feel pretty balanced on our margin guidance at this point.  So in terms of the second part of your question around the value-oriented consumer, we think that we're watching the macro developments carefully. And Q1 was solid. As you saw, we had positive comps in factory. But we saw outperformance in our full-price stores as that consumer remained healthy and robust.  And so with that disparity -- which has been happening over the past 5 quarters. So this is not anything new. But given that disparity, we thought it was prudent, given what's happening with that consumer externally to take a more cautious approach in the back half, notably on that consumer.  So we feel good about where we're at. We feel about good maintaining our full year guidance. And I do think we've derisked the back half of it with that -- with some caution around that value consumer. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Patrice, on the multiyear foundational initiatives that you walked through and that you've put in place, when do you believe you saw the inflection in the organization that for this year supports your reiterated 8% constant currency top line forecast, and that's despite the dynamic macro backdrop? But then also, how do you see these initiatives as accretive multiyear if we're thinking about your sustainable top line plan, which I think in the past was cemented in the low to mid-single digits? Patrice Louvet : Thanks for your question. Listen, I think let's take it by region on the first part of your question. Certainly, our business has been on a very strong trajectory in APAC for years, right? And that's really where a lot of the concepts that we've expanded across other regions have originated. The work on ecosystem, the work on brand elevation, the work on AUR growth. We then took that to Europe, I would say, 18 to 24 months ago, and we've seen the benefit of that play out. And you saw another very strong performance this past quarter in Europe in what, as Jane described, was a pretty volatile environment. And then as far as North America is concerned, we had a lot of resetting to do to get the business on healthy foundations both from a consumer targeting standpoint, bringing in a younger, more elevated consumer, from a product standpoint, focusing disproportionately on more elevated proposition. From a go-to-market standpoint, resetting our wholesale distribution, completely transforming our digital operations. Most of that is now in place, Matt.  So I think as we started this fiscal year, we're lapping a couple of elements, Chaps, licensing, Club Monaco, sale. But all in all, I think the entire organization is now in execution mode relative to the strategy that we're applying across all of the regions.  We do expect, as I mentioned in response to question, these building blocks to be sustained for many years, right? If you think about the elements that we have, we have a brand that just keeps getting stronger and stronger every quarter that goes by. And this isn't just me saying it. This is the consumer telling us that in the tracking that we do on a monthly basis. It's getting stronger on awareness, getting stronger on brand consideration, getting stronger on Net Promoter Score. Our luxury perception is increasing, actual scores were very strong in North America this past quarter, thanks to all the good work our marketing teams are doing there.  Our product portfolio, both our core, which is going to be particularly helpful as we navigate discontinued uncertainty and has proven to be a real strength for this company during more difficult times is coupled with high-growth categories where we are seeing momentum acceleration. And I really expect, Matt, that this will continue for quite some time, whether that's the focus on women's, whether that's the focus on outerwear and others.  And then our key city ecosystem, which is very focused, top 30 cities, frankly, there's still a lot of white space. And as we continue to strengthen these ecosystem, we're seeing consumer response that we're really pleased with. We talked about in the prepared remarks, the opening we just did in Chengdu, that establishes brand's presence in another key influential area of China. And we're going to be activating the full ecosystem as we've done in other key cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but we're also doing that now in North America.  So looking at -- context, looking at continued volatility, which I think if you just reflect on the past few years is, I think, the new normal for our generation right now, these elements are sustainable, and they are real competitive advantages. And we will continue to sharpen the saw to get better and better as time goes by, but I expect these to drive momentum for us for a while. Jane Nielsen : Yes. I think there are a few pivotal moments that we've seen as we really started to develop multiple engines of growth through the post-pandemic period. One was, as China came back after -- and we had pivoted to extensive digital growth, we continued digital growth and saw a big acceleration in comps. So that was, I think, a pivotal moment for us in APAC. In Europe, as we went into the pandemic, you saw very strong e-commerce growth that was based on new consumer acquisition at higher operating margins. I think that was a pivotal moment in Europe. And then in North America, starting in Q4 of '21, our sellout went positive in wholesale has maintained positive along with share gains and pricing increases. And at the same time, we started to really move having reset our business in RLE and you saw nice growth and big margin movements in RLE in North America. I think that Q4 '21 was also a pivotal moment, and those all give us confidence in the pivot to strong positive growth that we're guiding to this year. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Nice to see the progress. Jane, you just mentioned what I was thinking about is wholesale and the pickup in strength in wholesale that you've been seeing across the board. How do you think about that as different drivers in each region? Is there different reasons for each? Is it the refurbishment of the in-store shops in terms of what you've been seeing? And then to pick up on that, on your 30 key cities retail store network, where are you in that redevelopment? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Well, Dana, it is a story that's different across the different regions. In North America wholesale, you'll recall, this has been a long-term strategy. So I think the first stage was really getting out of about 2/3 of our doors and really elevating to the higher end of the doors with our wholesale partners. That was step one. Step two was working with our partners even in the -- more than a year in advance of the pandemic to say we are going to take pricing. We're going to take pricing in partnership with you. We started to do that in FY '21, have improved it in our own stores. And that's been a real pivotal moment. Our inventories were clean. We prepared for it. We had the momentum in the market in our own stores, and we've pivoted to what you're seeing this quarter, which is double-digit growth on a mid-teens sellout so very positive dynamics that really had the groundwork laid many years ago. And now it's pivotal.  The partnership with our wholesale partners has never been stronger. We've moved into this strategy together. We were prepared for it. And so we're moving in partnership. And of course, we're reinvesting in those wholesale doors, not just in North America but also in Europe. And I think the strength in Europe has come from -- we were already in very elevated partners. And there's a very strong pure-play component where we have great representation and are gaining share in Europe. So strong partnerships in Europe that we did -- we've been doing the strong elevation journey, and they've been following in that elevation journey, with great momentum from our digital pure play partners and the pure play digital components of our more traditional partners. So very strong and very pleased with our wholesale around the world.  Wholesale is are a very small portion of the Asia Pac business. It's much more concessional. And our journey on the key cities is really about creating the right ecosystem, which includes every touchpoint. You saw that in our guidance this year, we expect to open 200 new doors around the world, largely in Asia, but also in Europe and North America. Those are important pieces of the ecosystem. You've seen us open emblematic doors. The door in , the Chengdu door that Patrice talked about. They are centers for the ecosystem. And the work we're doing on wholesale and as we roll out local sites are really an important part of that third -- top 30 key city ecosystems.  So we have a proven model. We're continuing to roll it out. It goes across every touch point of the consumer, and we're pleased with our progress. And I think you'll see as we close out this year, we'll have a -- we'll have another year of good progress there. Patrice Louvet : And Dana, I would add to Jane's perspective on the top 30 cities. What's interesting, particularly when you look at the luxury landscape right now and I was in the conversation earlier this morning on this topic where you see a number of luxury players pivot from China to the U.S. in terms of investments. For us, as we look at our top 30 cities, they're pretty balanced across the 3 key regions that we operate in. And the U.S. still represents significant white space opportunity for us. So we're going to double down on that opportunity but continue to invest in APAC, continue to invest in Europe. We recently opened a couple of stores in the Berlin area, which is a key iconic cultural city for our brand. So I think you can expect that to be pretty -- it continue to be a broad-based effort across all 3 key regions for us. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Congrats on your continued success. I wanted to do a quick clarification, Jane. Did you say the spread between full price and outlets was widening? Or that was just maintaining the same level? And then I wanted to ask for a little bit more detailed response around China. It seems like you guys are putting up really strong numbers there at a time when others are struggling, given the lockdowns. Is it fair to say that the brand is at an inflection point in China? And if so, why now? Jane Nielsen : Sure. So what we said about -- we said for the last 5 quarters, we've seen a disparity between our full price comps in our outlet comps. And so as we look ahead, we are, I think, mindful of what could be coming for the value consumer based on the macros and wanted to embed some caution in our forward guidance for the balance of the year. Patrice Louvet : And when it comes to -- Is there anything else you want to add? No? When it comes to China, yes, we are very pleased with the work that our teams are doing in that market and the performance we are delivering. I don't know, Omar, that I would talk about an inflection point. We are seeing a general pace of growth that is quite healthy and strong, right? Digital was up 40% this past quarter in China, despite all the delivery challenges because of the lockdowns.  I think if you boil it down to the 3 key drivers for us, the team is doing a very nice job on the brand front, balancing global storytelling like our recent publisher's initiative, along with working with local influencers and local content and messaging. And I think that's really weaving the brand into the local culture in a way that is bringing in more consumers, younger consumers, more elevated consumers.  On the product front, I think the gang is doing a great job curating our global lineup to really make sure that we're delivering along the more elevated expectations of that customer. And we're seeing a really nice balance between our men's and women's business. It's actually the more balanced split that we have across the world. And actually, the Chinese market is a great source of inspiration for us as we continue to elevate our product.  And then we touched on it a couple of times earlier in this call, but the power of the ecosystem, right? And I actually think there's a virtual cycle there, as we build capabilities on the digital front as we establish iconic store presence that just consistently builds on itself and get stronger and stronger as time goes by.  So listen, we're not out of touch with the realities of lockdowns and things like that. But we feel like the brand is really nicely positioned in China at this point. It's something we're going to continue to invest in. And the key for us is to really stay in touch with that local consumer. Corinna Van Ghinst : Last question, please, Angela? Operator : Our final question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. Christopher Nardone : So you talked about your ability to pivot categories depending on the demand environment. Can you just talk little bit more about which categories have shown the strongest demand in the most recent months and then maybe some categories that are either dragging or may have a little bit too much inventory? Patrice Louvet : Sure, Chris. So it's actually really interesting to see what's happening with the consumer right now. And we're actually really uniquely positioned to capture the consumers evolving wardrobe choice. Because what we're seeing is a combination of reinvesting in core wardrobes. So specifically, that's products like sweaters or denim and then a pivot towards newness and elevation and sophistication, right?  So the pivot towards newness for us will translate into more elevated cashmere sweaters, for example, or a novelty and matching . And then you have consumers not going out during the day, right? And it's still early days on that journey, and therefore, a need for greater outerwear and need for greater dresses and need for greater sports coats. And then we're also seeing more evening activities more going out. So obviously, that's supporting and impacting our overall evening where more dressier parts of the portfolio.  So general direction of travel is elevation for your sophistication. Chris, when I look at categories, there are no categories where we feel we are heavy, if I could use that terminology. I think the team has done a nice job managing inventory across all of these, and that's the result of shorter lead times, greater agility, greater diversification in our supply chain. But very clearly, we are seeing the consumer pivot towards more sophisticated, more elevated products versus what we saw during COVID, that was much more athleisure reliant.  All right. Thank you for that question, Chris. Well, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing our updated strategic plan with all of you mid-September, September 19. Until then, stay safe, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Corinna. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day in September where we laid out our ambition to be the world's leading luxury lifestyle company. We also outlined our company's next phase of growth powered by multiple engines, which we are calling our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan. We are off to a strong early start with our second quarter performance, which exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line, demonstrating the consistency and momentum of our business around the world. At the same time, we continue to drive a culture of operating excellence as ongoing productivity is an important driver to fuel our near and long term growth. This resulted in another quarter of double digit AUR growth and sales exceeding our plan, even as the broader marketplace became more promotional into the fall as anticipated. Also, as we had expected from the start of this fiscal year, the global operating environment has remained choppy across many of our key markets. Our solid performance amidst this backdrop is a credit to our team's agility and execution as we focus on delivering what we can control. And while we expect this choppiness to continue in the near term, we're encouraged that our core consumer remains generally resilient despite the macro headlines, reflecting increasing desirability for our brand and the attractive value proposition of our products. As we navigate the broader macro headwinds, we're focused on driving our three strategic pillars of long-term growth. These include first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. Second, drive the core and expand for more, and third, win in key cities. With our consumer ecosystem and spanning everything we do is our commitment to deliver positive impact in the world across citizenship and sustainability. Let me take you through a few of our second quarter highlights across our plan. First on our efforts to elevate and energize our Lifestyle brand. As we continue to build our business for the long term, we remain focused on investing in our brand to deliver a differentiated elevated message to our target consumers. Consumers perception of Ralph Lauren as a luxury brand remained high at 78% and their perception of our brand's value for money continued to expand both sequentially and versus last year in the second quarter. This is enabling us to both strengthen our existing relationships and recruit new, younger high value consumers around the world. With the growth in our highest value, consumers significantly outpacing our total business. We are leveraging our core brand values and ROI driven marketing strategy in order to connect authentically with consumers and continue to gain market share. This was evident in the second quarter where we continue to focus our investments on driving brand desirability across a diverse range of activities. First, we celebrated the energy and optimism of sport to our annual sponsorship of the US Open Tennis Championships, which were particularly thrilling this year with record attendance levels and a 50% increase in viewership. It was hard to miss Polo on the court and in the audience from our official ball person uniforms made with recycled plastic to our timeless spectator style showcased by celebrities like Anne Hathaway, Diplo, Angus Cloud, and Jamie Foxx. We were also proud to outfit Serena Williams in Vogue, September issue where the tennis legend announced her retirement from the sport. Our 360 degree campaign for back to school drove strong conversion in our Polo Kids business this fall. Our class of RL video in August followed by our women's Polo ID handbag video in September were our top viewed Instagram reels on our Polo handle of all time. We continue to capture key brand moments that resonate with fashion lovers around the world. 2022 was the year of weddings and we were front and center dressing Hollywood royalty like Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck along with NBA superstar, Kevin Love\u2019s wedding to Kate Bock. A few weeks ago we hosted our first ever fashion show on the West Coast at the Huntington Library in L.A., celebrities and friends of the brand like Lily Collins, John Legend, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, Jessica Chastain, Diane Keaton and newlyweds JLo and Ben Affleck joined us in celebrating the optimism and joy of California Dreaming, featuring our full luxury lifestyle brand ranging from RRL to Polo Men's, Women's Kids and Home. And as we continue driving our brand leadership deeper into the metaverse, we launched our first collaboration with Fortnite last week in time for holiday. The popular online game has more than 400 million registered accounts with a strong following among 18 year to 24 year olds. The partnership includes a special collection of digital outfits and two special drops of physical product available in our DTC channels and select specialty retailers around the world. Together these activations are attracting younger full price consumers to our business. We exceeded 50 million social media followers globally this quarter. A high single digit increase to last year led by Instagram. In our DTC businesses, we added 1.3 million new consumers similar to recent trends and our online search trends grew low double digits to last year in Q2, significantly outpacing our peers across our top markets globally led by Polo shirts and fall apparel such as sweaters and fleece. Moving to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. As we work toward becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company, our products all come back to the idea of inviting consumers to step into the world of Ralph Lauren. Ralph and our design teams are capturing the breadth of styles and end users consumers are looking for today from a more sophisticated take on casual comfort to their modern hybrid approach to where to work and social gatherings. Starting with our core product, which grew mid-teens in the second quarter, supported by all key categories led by sweaters, seasonal core knits, sweatshirts and chinos as we discussed our Investor Day. Our core product comprises about 70% of our assortment and is a key competitive advantage in the marketplace. In times of uncertainty, consumers continue to invest in brands and products they know and trust. Our core also establishes the credentials for driving our high potential categories, which include Women's Outerwear and our emerging Home business. Together, these high potential categories grew high teens in the quarter. Women's represents our single largest long-term opportunity for market share gains and category growth. As a company, we are trading her into the brand, including the successful launch of our Polo ID handbag collection. This year we are trading here across by building an offering of essentials like sweaters, sophisticated coats, dresses, and denim that will form the foundation of her wardrobe and expand her lifetime value and we are trading her up to more elevated product through our hybrid styling as only Ralph can with Women's AUR up 20% in the second quarter. Within Outerwear, another high potential category, which now represents about 10% of sales, we are establishing our brand as a go-to player for the category. Second quarter highlights included our quilted Beaton and Harper jackets, cotton twill, city windbreaker, and Terra Packable vest. Our Kids Outwear business was led by the launch of our P Layer outerwear system, a versatile collection of functional outer shells and liners constructed of all recycled materials, other product highlights and special releases. This quarter included our US open collection, which drove our highest sales ever for the event. We also introduced our first US Open Sneaker, which sold out in our stores our NOLA Collection for women inspired by the culture, climate and beauty of New Orleans and our Polo Active Club collection tailored to next generation consumers. The digital campaign was brought to life with skateboarder filmmaker Mikey Alfred and his skate group. From our Polo bear sweaters to a return of tailored dressing. Our teams are consistently delivering the styles consumers are craving in this new normal. Switching to our third key initiative win in key cities with consumer ecosystem, we continue to drive our long-term strategy of investing in our key city ecosystems around the world in the second quarter with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touchpoints across every channel. Each of our ecosystems is led by a digital first mindset representing the best expression of our brand through innovative storytelling, dedicated shop-in-shops and virtual selling experiences. Second quarter sales for our total Ralph Lauren and digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, department store.com, pure players and social commerce accelerated to mid-teens growth in constant currency. Our Asia digital ecosystem once again drove the fastest growth globally over a smaller base, up more than 60% in constant currency to last year. Within our own digital sites, sales grew mid-single digits in the second quarter and more than 40% on a two year stack. We continue to drive an increased penetration of full price selling through elevated products and investments in AI powered targeting and high quality new consumer acquisition growth was also supported by the continued launch of new sites, including the recent additions of Korea and Australia. Our digital capabilities also provide true endless aisle connectivity to our physical channels. Indeed, our stores remain a critical component of our ecosystems to build our brand and consumer engagement around the world. We opened 29 new stores and concessions in top cities globally this quarter with the vast majority in Asia, particularly the Chinese mainland. Our brand momentum and opportunities in China remains strong with sales up more than 30% performance was balanced across Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Mainland despite mandatory closures in the period. As you heard at Investor Day, China provides not only the successful blueprint for our elevated ecosystem strategy globally, it also represents one of several geographic long-term opportunities for our brand. With strong brand momentum, our highest AUR in the world and significant runway for strategic store openings to strengthen our relationship with the Chinese consumer. Looking ahead, the strength we are also seeing across markets like Korea and Australia are just two examples of the diversity of growth drivers that we have around the world. As you heard in September, we remain bullish on our long-term growth opportunities and ability to strategically drive lifetime value across all of our regions. And finally, touching briefly on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five business enablers, which we highlighted in September. These include our people and culture, one of our key competitive advantages, best in class digital technology and analytics, superior operational capabilities, the powerful balance sheet and leadership in citizenship and sustainability. I won't go through all of these in detail again, but in the second quarter we were particularly proud to be named one of the world's best employers by Forbes. Our people are at the heart of everything we do. They inspire us to be better and to do better. Just a few weeks ago, our teams around the world came together for our first in-person Pink Pony Walk since COVID. We celebrated the Ralph Lauren Foundation's $25 million grant to fund five cancer centers in the US this year, but it was also a moment for us to reflect on our purpose and what we've been through over the past few years as humans as an organization and the important role we play in our communities. In closing, we are highly aware of the macro challenges across each of our geographies. Ralph and I are exceptionally proud of the creativity, agility, and execution. Our teams continue to demonstrate as we effectively navigate these dynamic times and while we expect the environment to remain choppy in the near term, what gives us confidence to deliver on our commitments are our powerful authentic brand. Ralph built a brand that stands not just for one product but a lifestyle, a dream to aspire to our multi-pronged strategy with diversified growth across regions, consumer groups, categories and channels, and our fortress foundation. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate solid progress on our NGC accelerate plan, exemplifying our team's execution strength across our multiple strategic drivers and superior operational capabilities in the face of further macro challenges and disruptions around the world. Our top line growth continued with Q2 revenues up 5% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency ahead of our outlook. This quarter's was once again supported by positive growth in constant currency across all three regions. Operating margin also slightly exceeded our expectations, even with inflationary cost pressures and a more normalized cadence of investments versus last year. We believe our elevated brand focus strategy and targeted investments when combined with our culture of operating discipline and Fortress Foundation enablers put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation through uncertain times. Let me take you through our second quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues increased 13% in constant currency above our outlook led by double digit growth in both Asia and Europe. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales continued to outpace our total company rate up mid-teens in constant currency on top of a strong compare of nearly 50% last year. This includes mid-single digit growth within our owned Ralph Lauren and digital sites on top of more than 30% growth last year. We continue to invest in enhanced digital content and storytelling and to expand the breadth of our offering, including the addition of a home shop. In the past year, we are also driving further improvements in the quality of sales with a meaningful increase in full price sales penetration and digital margins still strongly accretive to our overall profitability in the quarter. Total company adjusted gross margin was 64.6% down 270 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 80 basis points in constant currency in line with our outlook. Second quarter AUR was up 18% on top of 15% growth last year. Continued AUR momentum was more than offset by channel mix pressure from stronger than expected wholesale performance and higher product costs including freight. However, the higher freight spend enabled our improved fall on time delivery rates and full price selling to deliver revenue outperformance in the quarter. Compared to fiscal \u201820 pre-pandemic levels, gross margin was 310 basis points higher in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency representing 110 basis point decline in constant currency as we normalize spending versus unusually low levels last year during COVID. This was ahead of our outlook driven by strong operating expense discipline and productivity measures. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% to 51.2% of sales, including marketing expense growth of 18% over last year's lower spend. Marketing was 6.8% of sales in line with our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. While we have built increased flexibility across our operating expense structure, we remain committed to investing in our brand, which is driving both near term top line momentum as well as longer term brand equity. Moving to segment performance starting with North America. The region's pivot to growth continues with second quarter revenues up 3%. In North America. Retail comps were flat on top of a strong 31% COVID reopening compare last year. While we were encouraged by positive comp growth in our full price stores, this was offset by softer performance in our outlets. As anticipated in our guidance, our outlet AUR up mid-teens reflects our ongoing brand elevation efforts in the channel. However, we continue to see softness in our value oriented consumers a subsegment of the channel. In the current environment, we are focused on communicating our strong value proposition to the consumer, which as Patrice mentioned continued to strengthen in Q2. This is supported by our targeted personalized communications. We are managing this channel carefully given ongoing macro headwinds and have assumed increased caution in our fiscal \u201823 outlook North America store traffic trends remain below pre pandemic levels consistent with the broader industry. Although our foreign tourist sales continued to show improvements to last year. Comps in our owned Ralph lauren.com site were down slightly but increased more than 30% on a two year stack. While we were encouraged by our increased penetration of full price sales online, this was offset by higher seasonal clearance to keep inventory clean ahead of holiday. In North America, wholesale revenues increased 8% to last year accelerating sequentially from first quarter trends driven by full price channels. Our strong continued performance reflects our improved brand positioning in the channel with further market share gains in Men's, Women's and Kids versus pre-pandemic levels in key partners. Our sellout grew high single digits to last year on better than expected fall fill rates and enhanced marketing. Our AUR at wholesale also grew high single digits to last year. As we elevated product pulled back promotions and increased targeted communications inventories remain well positioned in the channel versus demand and we have not experienced cancellations to date for either holiday or spring \u201823. We still expect the channel to be up modestly in the second half of fiscal '23. Despite challenging compares from last year and our more cautious approach to spring \u201823, inventory buys off price. Sales declined double digits to last year and more than 60% to pre pandemic levels as we realign this channel to be an excess clearance vehicle. Moving on to Europe. Second quarter, revenue was flat on a reported basis and increased 15% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 3% on top of a 27% compare last year. Brick and mortar store comps were flat over last year's strong 28% compare, which benefited from the reopening of all markets post COVID. Total digital ecosystem grew mid-teens in the quarter, including a mid-teen comp in own digital commerce. While the first half trends were robust supported by improved receipt performance, we remain cautious in the second half of fiscal '23 into fiscal \u201924, given dynamic macro conditions across the region, Europe wholesale grew 9% on a reported basis and 24% in constant currency driven by stronger fall receipts and fill rates. Our outlook continues to embed a notable deceleration in the second half based on strong compares and macro headwinds broadly across the region. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 17% on a reported basis and 33% in constant currency. Asia retail comps were up 25% with strong growth in digital commerce along with brick and mortar stores. Over the last year's easier compares due to store closures by market every country delivered double digit growth or higher in the second quarter. This was led by strong continued momentum in Korea, up 26% in constant currency and sales in Japan, which increased 16% as we lapped COVID restrictions in the prior year period. Following last quarters, heavy COVID restrictions in Shanghai, China returned to robust growth increasing more than 30% in Q2 despite COVID related closures in about 35% of our Mainland stores, nearly all of China's stores were reopened by the end of the quarter. Southeast Asia and Australia both grew triple digits in the period in constant currency lapping, pandemic lockdowns. In the prior year across our regions, our Q2 performance continued to exemplify the diversity of our growth drivers, not just by geography but across product categories and channels. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be a cornerstone of our fortress foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times. During the second quarter, we returned approximately 220 million to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. We ended the period with 1.4 billion in cash and short term investments and 1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory increased 36% to last year moderating from first quarter trends, but strategically higher to support continued demand for our brand and products earlier receipts and higher goods in transit to mitigate global supply chain delays, increased product costs including freight and cotton, which we will start to overlap in the second half of fiscal '23 and continued elevation of our product mix. We are managing inventories carefully in this dynamic environment. While we still expect inventory growth to remain at similar levels through the holiday, this should become more closely aligned sales by the end of the fiscal year. We believe our inventories are well positioned with 70% of our business comprised of core and replenishment product. As Patrice mentioned, this drives greater consistency in our growth as well as better supply chain planning and visibility and shorter lead times. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on the evolving macro environment including inflationary pressures, disruptions in the global supply chain, COVID-19 foreign currency volatility and the war in Ukraine. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios and this guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts. For fiscal \u201823, we are maintaining our full year outlook in constant currency with revenues expected to increase high single digits or about 8% on a 52 week comparable basis. While the first half revenues outperformed our expectations, this incorporates our more cautious view on second half revenues, given the challenging consumer backdrop in Europe and North America. We now expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenues by approximately 730 basis points driven by the strengthening US dollar. As a reminder, we still expect fiscal '23 growth to also be negatively impacted by about 100 basis points, due to the absence of last year's 53rd week. We now expect operating margins at the low end of our previous range of 14 to 14.5% in constant currency. This reflects a more challenging global macro environment, including our more cautious outlook on second half revenues, geographic mix with a higher sales contribution from Asia this year and channel mix, including the impact of a US customs delay on select wholesale shipments in Q3 expected to be resolved in the next few months. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 200 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52 week basis and 13.4% on a 53 week basis last year, both on a reported basis. Gross margin is still expected to increase 30 to 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product mix more than offsetting increased freight and material costs. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 170 basis points in fiscal \u201823. While we still expect input costs to remain structurally higher in the near term, we expect gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we start to lap higher cost increases. For the third quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to grow in the low to mid-single digit range. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 780 basis points. We expect third quarter operating margin in a range of 17.3 to 17.8% in constant currency. At the midpoint, this represents a roughly 160 basis point increase to last year driven by gross margin expansion. As we start to lap higher air freight costs from last year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 180 basis points and gross margin by about 170 basis points in the quarter. We still expect our tax rate in the range of 25 to 26% for the full year and also for the third quarter, and we moderated our CapEx outlook to about 250 to 275 million based on the timing of projects. In closing, we are proud of our team's execution, agility, and progress on our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan this quarter even as we navigate a highly dynamic global operating environment, Ralph created an iconic brand that inspires people around the world to dream. These qualities hold as true today as they did 50 years ago. With our brand as our touchstone, we will continue to focus on what we can control and leverage our multiple engines of growth across geographies, product categories and channels. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions Operator : [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Michael Binetti with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Securities. Michael Binetti : One for each. I guess Patrice, you outlined the diversified growth engines that the investor day in September. You spoke to them again today. Just given the current macro that you talked to about today, which of these drivers are still the most relevant in your view? And then Jane, so North America operating margin compressed quite a bit relative to pre-COVID levels. Can you speak to where you saw the most pressure? How much is transitory in your opinion and how you're planning that North America margin and holiday in the rest of the year? Patrice Louvet : Thank you and good morning, Michael. So clearly the macro pressures are out there, right? Inflation currency, geopolitical concerns and so on, and you all know them as well as I do, and they're of course top of mind for us. That said, we have a clear game plan and as you mentioned, multiple diversified engines of growth. What I think is really unique for us is the breadth and depth of these growth drivers. It enables agility, so in other words, we have this unique ability to lean harder on some areas of the strategy if others are more challenged, and Q2 is actually a good illustration of that, taking it across the different growth drivers. If you could look at it from the regional side, we were proud that all of our regions grew top line in constant currency and we delivered disproportionate growth, as you heard in Asia where we're seeing the strength of the brand across just about every single individual country, whether that's, out size growth in Korea, Japan, Australia, Southeast Asia, and we're particularly proud of the continued growth in China. Even with a number of our stores closed with China up 30% this last quarter. If you look at this through the channel lens, we're encouraged that the strength in our full price businesses is more than offsetting the softness that we're seeing from our value oriented consumer subsegment, which is more prevalent in our outlet business. And on the product side, we can flex the breadth of our portfolio and I think we've demonstrated our ability to dial categories up or down for the consumers as their needs desires change. For instance, in this quarter think more sports coats and dresses and less hoodies. So our ability to be agile in this way is a real competitive advantage in a volatile environment, which already served us quite well during COVID. And to this end we really believe that this is the time to continue to be on offense, recruit new consumers and continue to take market share. Jane, over to you on North America. Jane Nielsen : Okay. So good morning, Michael, and thank you for the question. So in Q2, our margins in North America were negatively impacted by a more normalized level of marketing investments versus last year we were more cautious last year given some of the pressures in store and coming out of COVID and so this year really represents a normalization of that spend. So as that spend normalizes in the second half, we would expect that pressure or that leverage pressure from marketing to abate. We also saw more elevated freight expenses in the quarter as we move to make sure that we could offset receipt delays from global supply chain challenges and have inventory ready for full price selling. We think that that was the right decision. You certainly saw it come through in our AUR this quarter. We're also overlapping some higher labor costs in the year and expect that to abate as well in the second half. So longer term, we the real opportunities in North America, both on the wholesale side and on the DTC side. We're in the earlier phases of our journey in wholesale, so that's encouraging as well as some of the earlier phases in outlet where we see opportunities in the margin between full price in our outlet. So we're optimistic and expect that to start to play out in the second half. Great, thank you. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Thank you. So Patrice, on current positioning of the Polo brand. What do you see as the global market share opportunity? What have you seen more recently and what have you seen from recent selling trends, maybe a direct to consumer, any change in wholesale orders at all? And then just for Jane, what is your level of visibility on outlet in Europe as we think about the moderation that you've embedded in the guide today? Patrice Louvet : So Matt, what's exciting about this business candidly is how fragmented the market is, right? So our market share is while we have a sizable business in Polo, Men's, Women's and Kids. In relative terms, it\u2019s still very small. So we have incredibly long runway when it comes to market share growth across all three businesses. You will have seen in the more recent share reads that we're continuing to grow share on Men's, were continuing to grow share on Women's Continuing to grow share on Kids, particularly strong performance last quarter on kids' share growth. And I think as we look around the world at what Polo stands for, that the type of products that we have within our lifestyle portfolio and what the consumer is looking for right now, we actually feel that we're really in the sweet spot of consumer demand with the breadth of our range and with the overall positioning across Men's, Women's, and Children's. And I think this is as true in North America as it is across Asia, as you heard me, referred to performance earlier as well as in Europe. So I think we're very nicely positioned on Polo and we're going to continue to invest to bring in more consumers, continue to elevate the positioning across that portfolio. When it comes to your question on wholesale orders and Jane and I will tag team on that in the second part listen, there are a few things I would say about our wholesale partnerships right now. First of all, I am really pleased to see how aligned we are strategically with our key wholesale partners, both in North America and around the world. And that's really enabling us to look at things through a similar lens when it comes to, to growth and value creation. We have seen strong progress this past quarter. You saw North America of 8% strong results in Europe and Asia as well. We are not seeing any pullback on orders or any cancellation of orders around the world with our key wholesale partners. So I would say, Matt, as we, as we said in the guidance, we are not seeing cancellations at this point, but we are more cautious and we took a more cautious stance on our spring buys, given the macro pressures that we're seeing. So while we're very happy with our position in sales, especially in the second quarter, we wanted to be well positioned for the holiday season, overlapping a challenging previous quarter. We are embedded in the guidance, a softer outlook for spring based on those macro pressures. And as we look at in the second part of your question, the visibility that we have in outlet in in Europe, we have seen softer trends and we've incorporated those softer trends into our guidance for EMEA. It's not a one country, one region story. I do think that there is variability in the marketplace. This quarter, Germany performed quite well. We saw some more pressures in in the UK, as you might expect, given some of the inflation pressures, coupled with some political uncertainties. Given the fuel pressures and the outlook we have, we've taken a more moderate view across Europe, but especially in some of the countries like Germany, where we expect gas rationing and fuel prices to be an explicit pressure. Corinna Van Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gabby Carbone with Deutsche Bank. Gabby Carbone : Hi, good morning. Congrats on the nice quarter. So my question is on the promotional environment, it is getting, more challenging out there, giving the high inventory levels across the marketplace. What do you believe is working in Ralph Lauren's favor as you continue to deliver higher AURs? And then just as wondering if you could dig into category performance and where within the business you're seeing the strongest demand. Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Of course. Thanks, Gaby. So what we're seeing across the competitive environment, we are seeing an increasingly promotional environment, as was expected, there you can see the results as well as we do. There's excess inventory out there and many are looking to liquidate. But our long term strategy, despite the cure the promotional environment has not changed. We're trying to stay agile and mindful of the competitive environment, but we really have multiple vectors of growth across AUR. And I think that that is really serving us well. Saw that show up in our AUR at plus 18% this quarter. And we're really encouraged underneath the covers that despite our higher AUR, within a more promotional context that we've seen, our value ratings from our consumers continue to increase, increase both versus pre pandemic levels and sequentially again this quarter. So for us, that's a key IOR indicator and gives us a lot of confidence. Now that being said, as we have in the past, we build a strategy that has, that is fully aligned with our long term strategy, but has some flexibility in it. We don't, we are not going to overly react to the promotional environment, but we are going to be strategic about it and know that we need to stay competitive. We feel good about that. We feel good about into the second quarter. We've embedded in our guidance, the confidence that we'll be able to offset inflation with pricing. And you can see that in our implicit gross margin guide. So feeling good and feeling good about the consumer, and especially because it's really based on our multi-year elevation work that we've done as well as the reset work we've done. That's really put us on a healthier base. Yeah, increasing desirability, increasing value equation. Those are things that we're driving and we're really pleased to see because that will drive sustained performance. On the product front, Gaby, probably three things I would call out. One is our core is actually doing quite well. It was mid-teens this past quarter, and as we talked that investor, our core is 70% of the company, It's actually not surprising that it's doing well because I think at times where consumers are more discerning on where they spend their money, obviously they're going to gravitate towards brand they know and trust and learn to gravitate towards products they know and trust. So strengthen the core. We've seen really nice performance in our high potential categories, which were up high teens this past quarter in constant currency. The probably the best performer was again, Outerwear where we saw a very strong performance, where we're also very excited to see the progress we're making on Women's across collection Polo Women's and Lauren. And then the last thing I would highlight is the tailored business continues to, to strengthen and improve. So to my prepared or earlier response to Michael's question, we're seeing more sports coats and less hoodies. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my question. Great execution this quarter. I wanted to ask you about some of the new consumers the many new consumers you who joined the Ralph Lauren franchise during COVID I think many of them younger. How, are those consumers performing in this kind of post-COVID era? Are they still kind of behaving with not much price resistance to the brand? I'd also love a quick update on the wholesale channel. Just give us a quick reminder on how you and the wholesale, your wholesale partners are managing inventory planning differently today versus in the past as we're seeing some other retailers and brands out there going to get seeing some pockets of blow-ups and inventory that you're seeing seeming to be able to avoid. Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Omar. So listen, we're going to talk team with Jane on this one on the consumer front. So up again, 1.3 million this past quarter. I\u2019m really pleased with actually the makeup of that new consumer cohort, younger, exactly, to your point, higher value, less sensitive to promotional activity more, more diverse. When it comes to response to our product and AUR -- we're seeing pretty consistent positive response to our AUR increases across the different products. And again, it really traces back to what Jane mentioned earlier, which is the progress we're making on brand desirability and value equation and our value perception scores are consistent across the different segments, and that is relevant for those younger consumers we're bringing in. I expect with the partnership that some of you may have seen, that we will continue to bring in some of these younger consumers as we're able to really connect with them where they, where they play, no pun intended and, where they want to engage with brands. So feel good about that one. Data point that we're particularly pleased with is retention, right because it's a wonderful thing to bring in new consumers, but you want them to stay within the franchise. So we can drive this concept of lifetime consumer value. And we've seen our retention scores actually strengthen this last quarter across the board, which I think bodes well for, for the future. So Omar, I would just call out a few key differences in terms of our inventory planning with our wholesale partners. I think throughout our reset as Patrice called out, we've had an incredibly productive and transparent dialogues with our wholesale partners and have really approached them with the spirit of partnership. But the focus has really been on sell out performance as the key driver to receipts and expected sell out in the coming seasons. That's been our focus. It's been our mutual focus, and that is a strategy that's really winning for us. In addition for that, we've really tried to pivot the conversation away from VA negotiations towards natural margin accretion for both our wholesale partners and for us. So it's still an emphasis on profitability, it's total system profitability, and it's focused on natural margin, which plays nicely in to the AUR and elevation that we're driving in wholesale. And we're doing that together, of course. And then from an inventory position level, we've made a commitment to be in our wholesale partners with inventory in time for the full spectrum of full price selling. You saw us take some air freight for that, but we're doing the spirit of partnership. And I think it, if you look at this quarter, again, strong sellout, strong AUR performance, that strategy and that partnership of working with them to make sure they have the inventory that the consumer needs has been very productive. We're in good position for holiday. Our inventories are clean, they're fresh. We are above last year's second quarter level because as you'll recall, we were at an artificially low level given supply chain challenges, but we're still about 20% below pre pandemic levels in this same quarter versus FY \u201820. We think that's the right level given our strategy. So we feel good about it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great, thank you so much. I have a two part question. Patrice, could you elaborate a little bit on the momentum in China that you've seen? Has it continued so far in this quarter and given Singles Day is upon us, is that going to be important for the brand? And just maybe just talk about what some of the key drivers have been in China, and then secondly it seems like the trend in buying back stock has accelerated a little bit from where it was last year, do you expect the trend to continue through the rest of the year? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Very good morning, Jay. Listen, we're really proud of the team's execution in China, actually across the entire APAC region, and we continue to see near and long term brand opportunities in China. What's really working well right now, but has been for a while, right? This is not just a one quarter story, is the fact that the teams are weaving the brand into the fabric of the local culture and translating our core values, our core propositions in a way that's resonating with that younger Chinese consumer, both men and women. And they're taking both global programs that they're translating in the market, and then also complementing that with, with local activities, partnerships with influencers and others. The second piece is the product offering and, and the curating that the team is doing there to really make sure that within the broad range of products that we have, we have items that really resonate with that specific consumer. And I think this Jay, but our highest AUR is actually in China, right? So that's where we're focusing some of our most elevated products and we're seeing very good response from the consumer. The last point is around connected retail, and I think China to some extent is our poster child on connected retail and bringing all of that together digital brick and mortar in a way that is seamless in a way that really meets consumers\u2019 expectations. So those have been the drivers this past quarter have been the prior quarter -- will continue to be moving forward with really a team that's in touch with that, that local consumer understands that local consumers and ensures that we're showing up in a way that's, that's incredibly relevant there. So our Singles\u2019 Day is concerned. So Singles\u2019 Day for us is really more of a brand building opportunity than it is an opportunity to sell a whole bunch of volume. So our game is not high promotional activity. We're not interested in doing that. And over time I think that strategy has worked for us. It's really about brand exposure, brand awareness, brand desirability, and we're in the middle of it. So we will see how ultimately all this has played out, but what we've seen in key events leading up to Singles\u2019 Day is we've actually seen out outperformance consistently. So our encouraged with how China is going, but I, I put in, in the context of the broader growth drivers for the company of course momentum in China, but we have many geographical opportunities in addition to, to what's happening in China. On the repurchase side, Jay, you have seen us be more, more aggressive are guidance supplies about 450 million to 500 million in buybacks a year. In the first half we've repurchased about 390 million in shares. We tend to be fairly ratable, but opportunistic as well. And given the price where it was, often below $90, we felt that was an outstanding time to buy back our shares and so you saw us lean into that. Again, I think we're comfortable with our annual guidance. We might be on the high side of that and remain opportunistic, but it's about the right range for us from a buy back standpoint. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. Chris Nardone : Good morning, Thanks for taking my question. Can you elaborate a little bit on your guidance for gross margin expansion in 3Q? Is there any way to provide guardrails around the magnitude on a reported basis? And then also tied to that, can you just discuss how your expectations for markdown activity in your DTC channel has changed compared to when we last spoke at your investor day? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : So, our guidance does imply a an improvement in in gross margin through the second half. Notably in the fourth quarter, you'll in the second half we'll start to lap higher air freight and product cost increases from last year. And while there's, while we expect those inflationary factor to still be with us, we'll be able to move into higher gross margin as we overlap some of the more significant increases last year. And as you look at it from a roughly a reported basis, I would expect as we called out in the third quarter, that growth that FX would impact us by about 170 basis points. And we're calling that it'll be about similar for the full year. So FX is a meaningful headwind as we as we move through this year. But you'll start to see us get actual gross margin improvement in the second half, both on a reported and a constant currency basis. And then the second part of your questions. Chris Nardone : Markdowns? Patrice Louvet : So as we look at a more promotional environment again, our strategy is not changing. We're on an elevation journey. Our long-term pricing strategy is to match our pricing with inflation as we guided before. We expect inflation headwinds to be meaningful in the second half, but we're also confident that we'll be able to offset those inflation factors. Now that being said, we while we won't follow the competition down in any way, we will, we have built flexibility in our plan to make sure that we continue to offer a compelling value to consumers and be competitive on a total value basis in the marketplace. Corinna Van Ghinst : Last question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on all the momentum. Jane, how do we think about the implied operating margin expansion for the fourth quarter and then the timing and sequencing of operating margin expansion as we get out of fiscal '23, as some of the, the onetime headwinds roll off and freight maybe FX get a little easier? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Yes. So as we look at operating margin expansion in the second half, it's really predicated on that improved gross margin that I just talked about. That'll be the primary driver. You will also see that couple with SG&A leverage. Now we have taken some revenue caution into the second half, but we will still get SG&A leverage in the second half to drive a combination of operating margin expansion through gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage into the second half. So while some of that revenue deleverage has moved us towards, about the 14% constant currency OI margin, we're still very comfortable in our three year outlook of getting to that mid-teens OI margin. Next year I'm not a prognosticator on FX, it's been a meaningful headwind. But next year we feel confident in continuing our elevation journey on some of the margin rich categories that Patrice called out in terms of Outerwear and our Core performing well, we're well positioned with inventory. So we're encouraged by that. Next year as we think about inflation in Q1, we'll renegotiate our freight contract. You're seeing that spot market come down, that'll be a tailwind into next year. We'll also have a more normalized cadence of marketing through the year. So you won't see that first half, second half story play out. And we're also seeing a better cotton environment. So some of those material cost headwinds that we're facing now, we'll start to phase out. And remember, we long buy cotton, so I expect that to be in the second half of fiscal '24. But we've got nice layers of cost -- reasons for cost optimism, should I say, throughout the year, Corinna Van Ghinst : Jane. All right. Well listen, thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to reconnecting in February to share our third quarter fiscal '23 results and until then, take care and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Corinna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of better-than-expected performance, including through the important holiday season. All three regions contributed positively to revenue growth. And at the same time, we made strong progress on the strategic priorities we outlined last September in our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan. We have multiple levers of growth and a broad lifestyle portfolio of products. Combined with the agility muscle our teams have built over the last several years, this puts us in a position of strength to become the world's leading luxury lifestyle company even amid macro uncertainty. A key element of this strategy is our commitment to brand and product elevation as we have demonstrated over the past five years, and we're doing all this while maintaining flexibility to respond to consumer demand and market dynamics. This translated to another quarter of double-digit AUR growth even as the broader marketplace became more promotional, as anticipated. We also continue to drive a culture of operating and cost discipline, which enabled us to meet our operating margin targets in the period. As our guidance reflected from the start of this fiscal year, the global environment has been choppy. We are encouraged that our core consumer has remained generally resilient, which reflects the growing desirability of our brand. At the same time, we continue to watch our more value-oriented customers and channels carefully. In this environment, we are taking a pragmatic approach to merchandising, pricing and inventory planning. As we navigate ongoing macro uncertainties, we remain steadfast in driving our three strategic pillars of long-term growth and value creation. These are : first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem.  Let me take you through a few of our third quarter highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to invest in our most powerful asset, our timeless luxury brand and way of life to inspire and engage our consumers and ultimately, drive lifetime value. We continue to build our brand desirability with consumers while also growing their value perception of our brand. This is enabling us to grow both market share and AUR. In the third quarter, we drove a diverse range of both global and localized brand activations, showcasing the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. We kicked off the quarter with our California Dreaming Fashion Show at the Huntington Library in L.A. This represented our first ever show on the West Coast, where we have historically been underdeveloped and have an opportunity to scale our presence. From there, we launched into holiday with our Gift of Togetherness campaign, featuring friends of the brand like Shalom Harlow and Tyson Beckford. Our local flagship events range from a family-friendly pop-up skating rink in Ginza to live musical performances at Bond Street in London. These campaigns leverage our authentic brand values around family and togetherness combined with unique localized engagement to excite and delight our consumers around the world. For Polo lovers, we offered our 7 Days 7 Drops on our Polo 67 fan app with a limited edition collection of custom-made skis, vintage ski jackets and collectible posters from the RL archive. In Asia, we drove another successful Singles Day event, ranking #2 for men's apparel and #4 for women's apparel on Tmall. The campaign included our first-ever Tmall cat-faced logo collaboration, generating billions of impressions across online and offline channels in China's key cities. And as we continue to lead in gaming and the metaverse, we launched an innovative collaboration with Fortnite, targeted to next-gen consumers with additional exciting partnerships to come for spring and fall '23.  Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting younger full-price consumers to our business.  In our DTC businesses, we added 1.6 million new consumers this quarter consistent with recent trends. We exceeded 51 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year, led by double-digit growth on Instagram. And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers across our top markets globally, driven by our core categories. Moving to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Across our organization, we are committed to becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company globally. This starts with the work Ralph and our creative teams are doing every day to offer sophisticated, timeless products that meet the needs of our consumers across their modern lifestyles. Ralph Lauren has a unique positioning in the marketplace that has enabled our brands to thrive over 50 years. Our brand stands for much more than a single product or category. It invites our customers to step into their dream of a better life.  At the heart of our business is our collection of iconic core products, which represent 70% of sales and remain a consistent driver of our business season after season. Our core products grew high single digits in the third quarter, led by sweaters, seasonal core knits, sweatshirts and suit separates. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's, outerwear and our emerging home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low teens in the quarter. Women's represents our single largest long-term opportunity for market share gains and category growth as a company. We are trading her into the brand across categories to drive lifetime value and up to more elevated style with women's AUR up 12% in the third quarter. Highlights from the period included our dedicated head to toe holiday campaigns for both Polo Women's and Lauren, including the expansion of our Polo ID bags in new seasonal fabrications.  Other product highlights and special releases this quarter included the official launch of our Polo Originals line, elevating the upper tier of our core brand with high-quality AUR enhancing styles that pay homage to Polo's roots, our exclusive Navy and gold logo collection capsule with influential Japanese retailer BEAMS, and our Fortnite collaboration with core icons featuring the new Llama player logo and our Polo Stadium collection of digital and physical products. Through these dynamic times, we continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to give consumers what they want as their lifestyles evolve. This enables us to flex from stay-at-home sweatshirts to return to work outfits, to wedding dresses and eveningwear. Switching to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We continue to invest in our long-term strategy to develop our key city ecosystems around the world in the third quarter with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touch points across every channel.  Starting with digital. Third quarter sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, department store dotcom, pure players and social commerce increased high single digits in constant currency. Our Asia digital ecosystem once again delivered the fastest growth globally. This included another strong Singles Day with double-digit new customer acquisition and sales, significantly outperforming our peers even as we grew AUR by 28%. Within our own digital sites, sales grew low double digits globally in the third quarter.  As part of our fully connected ecosystems, we also continue to open new physical stores that enable consumers to engage directly with our brands around the world. We opened 55 new stores in concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter, with the majority again in Asia, particularly the Chinese Mainland. Our brand momentum and opportunities in China remain strong. We reported third quarter Mainland sales up high single digits in constant currency. This was an encouraging result in light of widespread COVID disruptions following the relaxation of zero COVID policies in the period with over 90% of our stores impacted by foreclosures, reduced trading hours and staffing levels. As our dedicated teams on the ground continue to manage near-term disruptions with agility, we expect the countries reopening to be a net positive as we continue to strengthen our growing presence in this key market. Elsewhere in the region, we continued to drive double-digit constant currency growth across Japan, Korea, Australia and Southeast Asia, where we opened our first Ralph's Coffee experience in Kuala Lumpur this quarter. In addition to our sustained momentum across Asia, we remain bullish on our long-term growth opportunities and ability to strategically drive lifetime value across North America and Europe. In Q3, we opened our largest children's store in the world on Via della Spiga in Milan. Located across from our flagship, we are now able to showcase the full breadth of our luxury lifestyle proposition in this important market. We also launched our first full-price emblematic store in Barcelona, another influential fashion market as we continue to build our connected ecosystems across the region. And finally, touching briefly on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. In the third quarter, we were proud to be recognized on Fast Company's 2022 Brands That Matter list for our collaboration with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges launched last March. This ground-breaking partnership was just one example of our commitment to evolve how we portray the American Dream in the stories we tell and the faces and creators we champion. We were also recognized as one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies, moving from #6 last year to #2 this year for our sector. And on the sustainability front, we highlighted our first cradle-to-cradle certified product just a few weeks ago with our luxury gold Cashmere sweater. A first-of-its-kind luxury product to achieve this global standard, this is just one part of our commitment to enable our past and future products to live on responsibly. This sweater is the first of five iconic products that we plan to make C2C certified by 2025.  In closing, our strong performance through the first three quarters of the year underscores our consistency and strong execution. This is underpinned by the power of our brand and Ralph Lauren's multiple drivers of long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Ralph and I are proud of our team's continued agility, execution and productivity as we effectively navigate a dynamic global operating environment. Our focus on offense, agility and pragmatism continues to inspire our approach moving forward. And I just want to take a moment to welcome our newest Board member, Wei Zhang, former President of Alibaba Pictures and SVP of Alibaba Group, who joined us this quarter. Her leadership experience across international business development, focusing on China, entertainment, media and corporate social responsibility make her a unique addition to our Board. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We are encouraged by our strong early progress on our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan. We leveraged our multiple strategic drivers and superior operational capabilities to deliver third quarter results ahead of our expectations. We drove another quarter of solid top line growth, with Q3 revenues up 1% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency, above our outlook. All three regions delivered positive revenue growth on both a reported and constant currency basis as well as positive retail comp growth. Operating margin was at the high end of our guidance with strong expense discipline more than offsetting lower-than-expected gross margin. Operating with discipline has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our long-term strategic plan with productivity helping to fuel our investments in sustainable long-term growth. Exiting the quarter, we continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, which has served us well through times of uncertainty. We believe our elevated brand, clear strategy and targeted investments combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress foundation enablers, put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation. Let me take you through our third quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues increased 7% in constant currency, above our low to mid-single-digit outlook, led by double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. Guidance and results included a timing shift with the week between Christmas and New Year's moving back into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year due to the 53rd week in fiscal '22. This benefited this year's Q3 sales by about 130 basis points, which should negatively impact our smaller fourth quarter by an estimated 170 basis points. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew high single digits in constant currency and more than 40% on a two-year stack.  With our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites, sales grew 10% on top of more than 30% growth last year. We continue to elevate and expand the breadth of our offering online while enhancing the user experience with a rich digital content. We are also driving further improvements in quality of sales with an increase in full price sales penetration and digital margins strongly accretive to our overall profitability in the quarter.  Note that the fiscal quarter shift benefited our own digital sales by about 2 points in Q3 and should negatively impact Q4 by about 3 points. We continue to deliver gross margin expansion in constant currency this quarter, consistent with our long-term guidance. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.2%, down 80 basis points to last year on a reported basis, but up 80 basis points in constant currency. The increase was driven by product mix elevation with AUR up 10% on top of 19% growth last year and lower air freight reliance following last year's supply chain disruptions. While we continue to drive our long-term brand elevation strategy, gross margins were below our expectations this holiday driven by : first, targeted outlet promotions in North America to drive conversion with our value-oriented consumers; second, stronger-than-expected post-Christmas sale days, which shifted into the third quarter from Q4 last year; and finally, higher duty costs in Europe. Compared to fiscal '20 pre-pandemic levels, adjusted gross margin was still 300 basis points higher in the third quarter. Our better-than-expected revenues and operating expense discipline in the third quarter also enabled us to deliver operating margins at the top of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margin was 16% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, representing a 190 basis point constant currency increase to last year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 1%, including a marketing expense decline of 8% over last year's disproportionately back half-weighted spend. Marketing was 7.3% of sales compared to 8.1% in the prior year period. As Patrice mentioned, operational excellence remains a key element of our fortress foundation, and we remain sharply focused on operating expense discipline even as we continue to invest behind our brands and targeted global expansion to drive long-term sustainable growth. Moving to segment performance, starting with North America. Third quarter revenues grew 1% as stronger direct-to-consumer performance more than offset a slight decline in wholesale, as anticipated. The shift of post-Christmas days benefited our performance by about 190 basis points in the quarter. This shift should negatively impact our fourth quarter sales by about 270 basis points. In addition, the absence of last year's 53rd week is expected to negatively impact North America by another 460 basis points in Q4. In North America retail, third quarter comps grew 2% on top of a strong 38% COVID reopening compare last year. While we were encouraged by another quarter of positive comp growth in our full-price stores, this was offset by softer performance in our outlets as anticipated in our guidance. Our outlet AUR was up high single digits, reflecting our ongoing brand and product elevation in the channel. However, we continued to see softness in our value-oriented consumers. We are focused on driving a strong value proposition to the consumer, which includes expanded category assortments, enhanced selling environments and targeted communications. Our fiscal '23 outlook still assumes caution in this channel through the rest of the year. Comps in our owned ralphlauren.com site increased 9% and more than 40% on a two-year stack, driven by strong performance in core product, tailored styles and footwear. Digital AUR increased on continued product mix elevation. In North America wholesale, revenues declined 2% to last year. As we discussed in November, the decline was entirely driven by a customs delay, which resulted in missed Q3 shipment windows, representing about 3 points of negative impact. As expected, we also saw a slowdown in replenishment trends as our partners focus on keeping inventories clean heading into the new year. Outside of this, our positioning in the wholesale channel remains competitively strong. We gained market share across men's, women's and kids in key partners, and our AUR and wholesale grew 10% on continued product elevation. Promotions on our brands at wholesale were largely aligned with our expectations going into the season. Inventories at wholesale are now normalized following last year's supply chain disruption, and we have experienced minimal cancellations to date for spring '23. We still expect wholesale to be up in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, despite our more cautious view on replenishment and our spring '23 inventory buys. Moving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. This 13% growth included about 450 basis points of benefit from the post-Christmas timing shift as well as a wholesale allowance benefit recognized in the quarter. We estimate the timing shift will negatively impact the smaller fourth quarter by about 120 basis points in Europe. Q3 European retail comps increased 11% on top of a 55% compare last year. Brick-and-mortar comps also up 11%, benefited from lapping the start of last year's Omicron variant as well as the post-Christmas sales shift into Q3. AUR increased 12% with gains in both brick-and-mortar and digital AUR.  Total digital ecosystem grew mid-single digits in the quarter, with low double-digit growth in owned digital commerce and wholesale dotcom more than offsetting softer pure-play results as anticipated. Europe wholesale declined 1% on a reported basis, but grew 11% in constant currency. This was ahead of our expectations, driven by roughly 8 points benefit related to lower-than-anticipated wholesale allowances as well as stronger spring '23 shipments and fill rates, more than offsetting softer reorder trends. Note that our wholesale outlook continues to embed a notable deceleration through Q4 based on challenging compares and macro headwinds. Overall, while our Europe business has performed better than expected through the first 3 quarters of the year, we remain cautious on the remainder of fiscal '23 into fiscal '24, given dynamic macro conditions across the region. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency, a strong result given significant COVID outbreaks in the Chinese Mainland as well as higher infection rates in Japan. Asia retail comps were up 8% with balanced growth across digital commerce and brick-and-mortar stores. By market, third quarter sales in Japan and Korea each increased mid-teens in constant currency. Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia were up more than 25% and 50%, respectively. The Chinese Mainland was up 7%, despite the significant COVID impacts Patrice mentioned, while Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan grew low teens in the quarter. We returned to full operations in the Mainland by mid-January. And while our teams are prepared to manage through further disruptions, we are encouraged by the continued resilience and strength of our consumer and brand momentum in China along with the rest of Asia. Moving on to the balance. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our Fortress Foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times. Through the third quarter, we returned approximately $560 million in the form of our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date. We ended the period with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory increased 33%, moderating from first half trends as we reduced goods in transit and significantly improved our lead times from last year's global supply chain delays. Inventory growth still reflects earlier timing of receipts, higher product costs and our strategy of product mix elevation. Nevertheless, we still expect to end fiscal '23 with inventory more closely aligned to sales growth. We continue to manage our inventory position fund with the majority still weighted to core and seasonless product. This gives us greater flexibility to adjust future production levels and allocate product to the channels and geographies with the strongest demand. We also continue to make meaningful improvements in transit times as we move through this year. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on the evolving macro environment, including inflationary pressures, disruptions in the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in the Ukraine. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios, and our guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts.  For fiscal '23, we are maintaining our full year outlook in constant currency with revenues expected to increase high single digits or about 8% on a 52-week comparable basis. Our outlook continues to assume a challenging consumer backdrop in Europe and North America. We now expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenues by approximately 600 basis points. We expect operating margin of approximately 13.5% to 14% in constant currency compared to our prior outlook of about 14%. This is based on a more modest level of gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we keep inventories current and align to demand. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 180 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis. Gross margin is now expected to be flattish to last year on a constant currency basis. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product mix to offset increased product costs. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 150 basis points in fiscal '23. For the fourth quarter, on a 13-week comparable basis, we expect constant currency revenue growth of about mid- to high single digits. On a reported basis, which includes the impact of last year's 53rd week, we expect revenues to be up 1% and 2% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points. Our outlook also includes about 170 basis points of negative impact from the week after Christmas shifting into fiscal Q3 from Q4 last year. We expect fourth quarter operating margin of about 5.5% in constant currency. This represents a roughly 190 basis point increase to last year, driven primarily by operating expense leverage as we normalize our cadence of marketing spend versus last year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 160 basis points in the quarter. We expect constant currency gross margins to be about flat in Q4. This implies roughly 50 basis points of expansion on a 13-week comparable basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margin in the quarter by about 140 basis points. We now expect our tax rate in the range of 24% to 25% for the full year and estimate a roughly 29% tax rate for the fourth quarter. Though this could vary widely as Q4 is our smallest quarter and highly dependent on mix and discrete items. And lastly, we now expect capital expenditures in the range of $240 million to $250 million based on the timing of build-out. In closing, our teams around the world are operating with agility and executing strongly, driving continued progress on our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan. This is a testament to the power of our iconic brand that Ralph created over 50 years ago, and the strength of our Fortress Foundation coupled with diversified engines of growth across product categories, geographies and channels. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the progress. Certainly seems that there's still a lot of moving pieces on the macro side and you beat again on top line this quarter while continuing to grow AUR, as the environment has become more promotional. Just bigger picture, can you talk about what gives you the confidence that your elevation strategy can continue to work in a less favorable macro or pricing backdrop? And along those lines, any expansion on your thoughts on the health of the consumer in the wholesale channel in different regions, and what you're seeing in your own retail DTC business with the health of the consumer? Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Dana. Thanks for your question. Listen, Ralph, Jane and I are really proud of our company's outperformance this year to date. As you mentioned, the macro environment certainly continues to be quite choppy, but I think we're used to that by now. Our teams have built this incredible agility muscle over the past few years, if you kind of reflect on what we've worked through COVID, inflation and now a relatively promotional environment. So this agility gives us confidence looking ahead, but it's that agility plus other three things that I would really call out. The first one, and it touches on your second question is, our core consumer remains quite resilient. And that's true around the world, and that's true across channels. And as you know, we've done a lot of work over the past few years to evolve our customer base to bring in a higher value, younger customer that played out again this past quarter, 1.6 million new consumers, higher value, less price-sensitive, younger consumer. The second point is our diverse growth strategy that has multiple growth levers, and we constantly challenge ourselves to make sure they're still relevant in the environment that we are operating in and looking ahead, and we believe they are as relevant as ever, even in a tougher environment. What do I mean by that? Well, you can look at our opportunities to grow across regions, right? We have significant growth opportunities, of course, across Asia, including in China, in particular, but also in key cities across North America and in Europe. On the product front, we have a very wide lifestyle portfolio, and so that enables us to drive our core. You saw our core did quite well this past quarter, up high single digits, but also go after high potential categories like women's up mid-teens this quarter and outerwear up high single digits. And then the third point is really around flexibility, right? And two things I would call out here. One is because of this breadth of product portfolio, we can really flex up and down. You've seen us do that over the past few years based on where the consumer desires, wants, needs are. And I'm sure we'll have the opportunity today to talk a little bit more about products and what we're seeing. But this ability to flex, I think, is quite unique, and it's a real strength for our company. The other thing is our elevation journey, means our pricing structure has built in flexibility, right? If you look back since the start of this elevation phase, our AUR is up close to 70%, which means we can still react to the competitive environment, including when it gets more promotional without walking back our overall brand elevation strategy. I was really encouraged to see our AUR performance again this quarter, up 10%, bringing in more consumers, driving strong topline growth in what is pretty clearly a more aggressive promotional environment. And then underlying our diverse and flexible growth drivers are two critical things : one is our ongoing productivity work, which is as relevant as ever; and the second is our fortress balance sheet. So while the environment remains choppy and we expect it to remain choppy around the world, we believe we are well positioned to continue to attract higher-value consumers and drive growth and value creation. If I double-click on your question regarding consumers and at the risk of repeating myself, a few things to call out. First of all, our core consumer is resilient and in good shape. And so we're seeing him and her respond nicely to the work we're doing on brand elevation, product elevation, shopping experience elevation. I'm very encouraged by the fact that the teams are able to continue to bring in large numbers of new consumers, 1.6 million, I think, is the highest we've done in several quarters now. We've been around 1.3 million, 1.4 million. And again, the makeup of that customer group is higher value, less price sensitive. So we feel good about that. We did mention last quarter that our more value-oriented consumer, which is a much smaller part of our business today, is obviously feeling the inflationary pressures and is having to be more discerning in terms of how they spend, but they're still buying clothes. And here, we're encouraged by our share progress because we're growing share particularly on the wholesale channel that you touched on, Dana. We're growing share in men's. We're growing share in women's. We're growing share in kids. So we're staying very focused on making sure our value perception continues to strengthen, and it did again this quarter such that across all channels, across all consumer groups, we win the consumer level. Jane Nielsen : And we had that win in North America specifically with AURs up 10%. So that elevation journey continued on a promotional day base that was about equal to last year. Really happy with that quality. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So Patrice, could you speak to demand relative to plan that you're seeing for the Polo brand? And maybe just outline market share gains that you're seeing in the women's category? And then, Jane, just in relation to your larger picture comments, how best to think about North America next year relative to your mid-single-digit multiyear target? And just any change in the path to mid-teens constant currency operating margins by FY '25 that we should consider based on anything that you're seeing today? Patrice Louvet : Sure. So sorry, on demand on the Polo brands, particularly in the Polo brand, as you know, is the heart of this company. We are seeing progress on men's consistently. And what I'm excited about, we touched on it in our prepared remarks, is the introduction of the Polo Originals line that kind of pays homage to the Polo roots, which is just a view the full line of products that our teams have being around to allow us with really a communication that's really resonating with the customers. So continuing to drive that elevation and tapping into the breadth of the portfolio so that if you want athleisure, we have that available with exciting products. But we also have investments in the more tailored proposition, which is where we're seeing the consumer gravitate more and more to this more elevated casual proposition. So Polo Men is really nice momentum with a number of engines of growth that were very promising for the future. Outerwear is obviously an area of strength on the Polo Men. On the women's side, across all the key categories actually, we're seeing Polo Women's get significant traction. And as we're seeing the consumer gravitate to this more elevated casual dimension, then we're able to leverage the breadth of the portfolio and that ranges from sweaters to dresses to acceleration in outerwear, and we expect that to continue. Obviously, we see significant growth opportunities ahead on Polo Women. And then on Polo Kids, we're also continuing to see nice traction and share growth, we\u2019ve seen share growth for quite a while on that business as well and expect that to continue as we throw a relatively wide net when it comes to attracting new consumers and leveraging the presence we have across multiple categories. So the range of product offerings we have on the Polo brand and the skew to our sweet spot, which is this elevated casual, I think, sets up to run nicely, not just for outperformance now, but for the future. Jane, I'll turn it over to you for the second. Jane Nielsen : Yes. On some larger-picture perspective now, we feel that this year's performance is consistent with our FY '25 guidance of getting to a mid-teens OI margin. And we feel that because our -- despite some macro choppiness, our strategy is working. Again, this quarter, we were able to offset inflation, putting up a 10% AUR growth. And what undergirds that gives us confidence is that our consumer value perception rating again this quarter improved and is obviously improved from the pre-pandemic level. So the consumer is giving us confidence in our ability to navigate with gross margin -- holding and expanding our gross margin over the next several years.  We also have a robust productivity plan that we outlined. We're still committed to delivering this $400 million over the life of the plan in productivity savings. We're investing in that, and we're seeing the benefits of that in our supply chain, in our buying groups and in just our cost management. And you saw that flow through this quarter in our expense management and beating our OI margin guidance. So those are things that are giving us confidence encourage, also the resiliency of Asia; multiple countries delivering strongly and the resiliency that we see in our China business and Europe continuing in a difficult environment to outperform. All those things are confidence builders that 15% is the right margin. On North America next year, I think that we've outlined as called out for the last couple of quarters, the pressure on the value consumer, I think we're responding appropriately and well within the guardrails of our strategy. So we're still confident in our outlook for growth in North America next year and are pleased with the progress we've made since the reset putting it on a healthier base. So absolutely, yes. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Congrats on a really nice holiday. How much of the AUR increase going forward is North America driven? And within that, how much should we think about from here is from SKU mix or channel compared to a like-for-like pricing opportunities? And then Jane, it feels like the right time to ask, North America margin crossed above pre-COVID levels this quarter for the first time in a while. It was nice to see. Could you outline bridge for North America operating margin to get back to the 21%, 22% zone that it was in prior to COVID. You've given us some of the components like digital being accretive, those kinds of things. You know our bigger businesses today. I'm curious what your thoughts are there. Jane Nielsen : Yes, sure. Let me take the first part of your question, which is AUR base. So as we move forward in this pricing journey, you've seen us continuously put up AUR increases across all three regions. Again, this quarter, we saw Asia, which is furthest along in the journey put a very strong AUR delivery, but more modest than the rest of the regions because they're further along in their journey. So fully offsetting inflation and expanding gross margin. Europe, which is in the middle of the journey also put up nice AUR expansion as did North America. I do believe that because North America is earlier on in his earnings that they will be slightly outpaced in progression through this long term -- through the length of our plan, and they're certainly positioned to offset inflation through the length of this plan. So it's not a disproportionate amount, but I do think there's more opportunities. We've just started this journey in wholesale. We're early on there. And we've continued to make progress across full price our outlets and our digital. So we're encouraged by the breadth of AUR progression that we see in North America.  And again, we have a multi-pronged strategy. Because of inflation, like-for-like pricing is a part of that, but we're getting continued benefits from geographic, and because we're shifting to DTC, we'll see DTC also be a positive tailwind for us and also including the elevation of our assortments, which will continue as we elevate the brand. As I look at North America operating margin, overall, we're very pleased with the reset of North America and putting North America on a more profitable base. Year-to-date, our margins have been pressured really by two primary things. One is, rate impacts were disproportionate in North America, and we do expect that to start to abate a bit in the latter fourth quarter, but certainly into FY '24. The other factor was wage actions that we took last year that were overlapping this year. Those were primarily in our distribution centers and in our retail staff. We think it was the right thing to do, and as we elevate the brand, that continuity is important in our retail. So clearly, as we come out of that and start to get a free benefit into '24 and we'll be out of the overlap of wages, it will be a positive benefit as we move it into North America. And as I said before, we have made some meaningful investments in digital. We have a home app. We now have a full content RL app. Those have been good investments that are now made, and we can start to leverage in the future. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Kearney with Barclays. Paul Kearney : Jane, I was wondering, can you help unpack the foreign currency into next year based on current rates? How much of the transaction impact has already hedged or locked in for the year? And what are some of the ways to recapture the 180 basis points of margin impact that you now expect from this year? Jane Nielsen : So the primary way that we will address gross margin expansion on both a constant currency and reported basis is going to be our pricing strategy. It's a proven muscle for us, and we expect to deliver over the next several years. Now foreign currency, given the tailwinds that we've seen this quarter, which we called out and the impact of ForEx will have lessened since the start of the year in our guidance, we're encouraged, but I don't have a crystal ball. But I do know that I think we've been relatively wise about the hedges we placed going into next year. And as currency continues to strengthen, we should have over translational and transactional benefit, but we do hedge dramatically in layers and again, just optimizing around being relatively smart and placing those layers. So I'm feeling good, but again, I don't have a crystal ball. And it is our practice, we'll give guidance in our fourth quarter results, but we will call out the impacts based on the spot at that time. Operator : The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Jane, I want to ask about China. I think you mentioned -- I know you usually don't mention quarter-to-date trends, but you mentioned that your China operations are back to full operations mid-January. I know it's only three weeks, but just for the audience, if you can kind of unpack what you're seeing? Is it just -- is it traffic just coming back? Or are you also seeing conversion? And then just one quick question on the 4Q gross margin. If you can give us some puts and takes, great to hear that the 4Q gross margin should be up 50 bps. If you can parse that out a little bit, that would be very helpful. Patrice Louvet : Laurent, we'll tag team on this one. A few things on China. First of all, I have to say, I am really proud of our team's execution, actually not just in China, but across the entire APAC region. And as we talked in prior forums, we see significant near and long-term growth opportunities in China on strong brand building, on relevant product offering and a connected ecosystem expansion in key markets. In Q3, we were up 7% constant currency in China, despite 94% of our stores impacted either by closures or reduced hours or staffing shortages. So it gives you a sense of the team's agility that I referred to earlier and the ability to kind of navigate that still connect with the consumer while the access is a little constrained. You are right that we don't generally comment on in-quarter performance, and it's only been 3 weeks, but we've been very encouraged by the reopening. We are now up and running everywhere, and we're seeing consumers reengage strongly. So far, I think, double-digit rebound across Mainland China. And we're seeing a combination of, of course, the return of traffic both on -- in our brick-and-mortar and also online and then strong conversion. And why strong conversion? Because the work that the teams are doing on brand desirability in China is really resonating with the consumer, and they're leaving the brand into the local fabric of the Chinese culture in a way that really sets us apart.  If you think about what the Ralph Lauren brand is about, right, it's understated luxury grounded in heritage and icons. And that's a pretty unique proposition. And based on where the Chinese consumers' mindset is right now, which is maybe a little less focused on short-term fashion and more focused on brands that have a history to have a heritage and have a set of clear values, that positions us very well. Team is doing a really nice job creating our product line up there, and as we've mentioned in prior calls, we're continuing to see consumers there gravitate towards our highest price items actually around the world. And then we're super excited about the way the ecosystems are playing out in the top six cities that we've called out. Those of you who plan to visit Mainland China in the near term, you can visit our new store in Shenzhen, which we opened a few days ago and is off to a wonderful start. In a store we opened recently flagship in Chengdu, which is also doing quite well. And then this is only about domestic consumption, right? So the other thing that's going to happen is, we're going to see Chinese travelers wanting to shop our brand around the world, and we're in a much better position in terms of brand perception than we were 3 years ago. So I think we'll be able to benefit from that, and we're starting to see some of that in Southeast Asia and parts of Northeast Asia for our business. So promising start, excited about the long-term perspective, and we have a very intentional game plan to win with the Chinese consumer. Jane Nielsen : Yes. A few things to this -- giving us confidence in our Q4 guide on gross margins, Laurent. But one is that what Patrice just said, which is we expect China to come back resiliently in the quarter. It's our highest gross margin country within one of our highest gross margin countries within Asia. So we expect that to be a mix benefit as we move forward in gross margin. We're also starting to see some of the freight benefits, both the reduction in air freight and some reductions starting in ocean freight. So we're encouraged by that as a tailwind. But underlying it all is our confidence in the pricing strategy that we have and the mix benefits that we have in our assortment moving forward into the fourth quarter, and that is really the strength along with the consumer perception strength that we see that gives us confidence in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our final question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Ike Boruchow : So Jane, that's actually what I wanted to ask about. So understanding the pricing strategies are working in the margins themselves in absolute terms are still very healthy, can you just explain, versus three months ago looking into Q4, the gross margin differential? Because you're lowering the gross margin for the year. I think The Street was looking at like flattish gross margin. Now you're guiding down 140. I know that that's FX-driven, but just directionally, something is a little bit worse ex currency. So I don't know if that has to do with wholesale being weaker, but can you just kind of explain exactly what\u2019s kind of taking place in Q4 versus maybe the prior plan? Jane Nielsen : So I think that when we guided in May, we gave guidance based on our best estimate of consumer response and pressures. I think the consumer -- the value consumer that we've called out is more pressured than when we gave our original guidance. And we've also looked at the fourth quarter and want to ensure that we are in good shape as we start fiscal year '24 from an inventory perspective. As we've committed, we're going to have inventories more closely aligned to sales, and that's been responding to the desires of our value consumers to have a really compelling value. Total value for us has made us a little more responsive to that and as well that we want to make sure that we're healthy on inventories as we move out of the fourth quarter. Patrice Louvet : Okay. Well, listen, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '23 results with you in late May. And until then, stay safe, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. When we met last September here in New York, we outlined our ambition to become the world's leading luxury lifestyle company and build a business that lives up to the potential of our powerful brand. As we close out the first year of our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan, we are particularly proud of the progress we have made on our strategic commitments in pursuit of this goal. Our teams around the world executed exceptionally well through a highly dynamic global operating environment to deliver another quarter and full year of strong performance. We over delivered on the top line this year with 10% constant currency growth, supported by all 3 regions. This included positive comps, further AUR growth, and brand-accretive ecosystem expansion across our top 30 cities. At the same time, we continue to balance this growth with a relentless focus on productivity and operational discipline. This is enabling us to fuel our long-term initiatives and also grow our profitability on a constant currency basis. As we called out at the beginning of fiscal '23, the global environment has been and continues to be choppy. Throughout this, our teams are demonstrating agility and flexibility to respond to evolving consumer demand and market dynamics. As we continue to drive our strategy of long-term brand elevation across every region and channel, overall, our performance this year underscore the general resilience of our core consumer, and growing desirability of our brand around the world. This translated to another quarter of double-digit AUR growth globally, even as we took targeted actions to keep our inventories clean and well positioned. We are well aware that a subset of our consumers who are more value-oriented are increasingly pressured by macro and inflationary headwinds. We expect these trends to persist in the near term, particularly in North America and Europe. While this demographic still represents a relatively high average household income, they are being more choiceful with their apparel dollars and seeking more value. In this context, we believe consumers will look to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond one season. In this environment, our roots in quality and timeless style are a competitive advantage and our growing brand desirability and value perception across all demographics support this. Turning to the fourth quarter, our successful performance was guided by our 3 strategic pillars of long-term growth and value creation. These are : first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few of the highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We remain committed to investing in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic brand, to inspire and engage our consumers and ultimately drive lifetime value. We continue to build our brand desirability with consumers while also growing their value perception of Ralph Lauren. This is enabling us to grow both market share and AUR. Our value perception increased, while our lifetime consumer value grew high single digits for both the fourth quarter and full year as we focus on trading consumers in, across and up within our lifestyle portfolio. In the fourth quarter specifically, we drove a diverse range of brand activations underscoring the unique Ralph Lauren Lifestyle. First, we continue to strengthen our leadership in the world of sports, with our annual sponsorship of the Australian Open. Now in our third year, we significantly outperformed our plan on both sales and media impressions as we successfully leveraged our Encore presence as well as our authentic partnerships with celebrities and influencers globally. Our Lunar New Year activations across Asia included our successful Polo Bear campaigns with WeChat and Kakao, helping to drive 13% growth in social followers in the region, led by tenfold growth on . At the Oscars in March, we were proud to outfit social activist and Noble Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai in a custom Ralph Lauren collection silver sequence gown. This iconic moment resonated with consumers, garnering over 8 billion media impressions globally. And as we continue to reinforce our leading position in gaming and the metaverse, we partnered with Web3 community Poolsuite as part of our Miami ecosystem launch this spring. The immersive experience included exclusive digital Ralph Lauren outfits and our first ever NFTs co-designed with Poolsuite members. Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting new full-price consumers to our business. In our DTC businesses, we added 1 million new consumers in the fourth quarter for a total of more than 5 million new consumers this year, consistent with our targets. This continues to skew increasingly toward next-generation under 35 consumers with whom we also drove our largest increase in luxury perception over the past year. We reached 52 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year driven by dynamic content on Instagram, TikTok, Weibo and other key platforms. And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers across our top markets globally, driven once again by our core categories. Moving to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. Our goal of becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company starts with our unique brand positioning in the market, which stands for so much more than a single product or category. It stands for the dream of a better life. From elevated hybrid dressing to quiet luxury, Ralph and our creative teams are delivering sophisticated, timeless products to serve our consumers across their modern lifestyles. Starting with our iconic core products, which represent about 70% of sales and remain a consistent driver of our business season after season. Our core grew low double digits in the fourth quarter, led by our spring-ready cable knit sweaters, Polos, Oxford shirts, chino shorts, relaxed tailoring and silt blend shirts and day dresses. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include Women's, Outerwear and our emerging Home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low teens in the quarter. Women's, our largest long-term opportunity continued to strongly outpace total company performance. Our accelerate plan focuses on trading her into the brand across categories and up to more elevated styles to drive lifetime value, with women's AUR up more than 20% in the fourth quarter. Our continued strong Women's performance was supported by strong growth in handbags as well as our global launch of Women's Polo intimates in March with a particularly strong start on ralphlauren.com. Other special releases this quarter included our Creed III movie collaboration featuring 6 limited edition looks worn by Michael B. Jordan in the film and account exclusive capsules targeted towards next-gen consumers, including our retro varsity release with ASOS, Polo Boxing Club collection with Musinsa, in Korea and icons in Madras with Beams Japan. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to meet consumers' evolving lifestyles. Switching to our third key initiative, Win in Key Cities with Our Consumer Ecosystem. We continue to invest in our long-term strategy to develop our key city ecosystems around the world with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touch points across every channel. Starting with digital. Sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased high single digits in constant currency this fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, our Asia digital ecosystem delivered the fastest growth globally. With our owned and wholesale digital channels, both contributing to 40% growth in the quarter. We were particularly encouraged by our strong Lunar New Year performance, which significantly outpaced peers, including Women's up more than 60% and continued elevation with double-digit AUR growth. As part of our fully connected ecosystems, we also continue to open new physical stores that enable consumers to engage directly with our brands around the world. We opened 21 new stores and concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter. With the majority again in Asia, particularly the Chinese mainland. We are strongly encouraged by our continued brand momentum in China following the countries reopening. Through 3 years of COVID disruptions, our teams worked with agility to build our brand presence in the market. And this year's outstanding performance was a testament to those efforts. We drove full year China sales up more than 20% in constant currency, including an acceleration in fourth quarter sales up over 40%. Looking ahead, we expect China to remain one of our fastest-growing markets. We opened 2 iconic World of Ralph Lauren stores in Asia this quarter in Shenzhen Luohu Mall and Pitch Street in Sydney, representing the most elevated expression of our brand to date in Australia. And here in North America, we opened a new store in Miami's Design District, showcasing the modern elegance and exceptional craftsmanship of our luxury collections. All 3 of these iconic stores are parts of the top 30 cities we highlighted at Investor Day. They are designed to anchor our city presence and drive desirability and engagement with consumers. And finally, touching briefly on our enablers, in addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. Some of the achievements we were particularly proud of this year included : the launch of our first cradle-to-cradle certified product with our luxury gold cashmere sweater, being part of Fortune's world's most admired companies, moving to number two from number six last year for our sector and Fast Company's 2022 Brands That Matter List for a collaboration with Morehouse and Spellman Colleges. And finally, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation's $25 million grant to fund 5 cancer centers in the U.S., including our newest center in Georgetown, which opened just a few weeks ago. In closing, Ralph and I are inspired by our team's performance this year, putting the company in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments even through a volatile consumer backdrop. And as the global environment remains highly dynamic, our focus on offense, agility and pragmatism remains the backbone of our approach moving forward. This year's progress on our Accelerate plan demonstrates that we have the right plan in place even as we face a more pressured environment. We have diversified levers of growth across geography, channel and category, a broad lifestyle portfolio of products that consumers know and trust and that we are actively flexing with the consumers' evolving needs and strong foundational enablers to support long-term growth and value creation from our talented people, innovative technology and supply chain to our balance sheet and muscle of operational discipline. And of course, all of this is underpinned by the strength of Ralph's timeless vision and our iconic brand, which continues to invite people all over the world to step into their dreams.  With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We are encouraged by this year's progress on our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan, which remains on track even with numerous macro challenges that our teams have faced this year. We leveraged our strong brand, multiple strategic growth drivers and superior operational capabilities to deliver strong financial results in a dynamic environment. For the full year, we delivered 10% revenue growth in constant currency, exceeding our guidance with growth in every region. We expanded operating margin and grew profits ahead of top line growth in constant dollars, consistent with our 3-year plan. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 13.7% in constant currency, with operating profit dollars up 15%. Our continued brand elevation and culture of cost discipline were key to our strong results and provided flexibility to more than offset softer gross margins as we focused on keeping inventories clean and well positioned in the marketplace. Operating with discipline will continue to be an important element of our long-term strategic plan with productivity helping to manage changing market dynamics and fuel our investments in sustainable long-term growth. And we continue to make important investments in our business while delivering strong shareholder returns, including more than $650 million this year in the form of our dividends and share repurchases. Exiting the year, we remain confident in both our strategic direction and our fortress foundation enablers, which are allowing us to drive our strategic initiatives even through times of uncertainty. Our full year and fourth quarter financial performance underscored this position of strength through dynamic times. Let me take you through some highlights from the quarter. Total company revenues in the fourth quarter increased 9% in constant currency, above our outlook, led by double-digit growth in Asia. Results included about 180 basis points of negative headwind from the shift of the post-Christmas sales week into the fiscal third quarter from our fourth quarter last year, as previously noted. Our digital ecosystem sales declined mid-single digits in constant currency. Q4 performance included lower European pure-play results as planned, following exceptionally strong performance last year coming out of the pandemic. Sales in our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites grew mid-single digits on top of 20% growth last year. As we continue to elevate this channel, our digital AUR grew mid-teens and our full price sales penetration increased meaningfully to last year. We plan to enhance the user experience with rich digital content and even greater customer personalization in fiscal '24. In addition to the AI machine learning capabilities, we've been utilizing for areas such as inventory optimization, forecasting and consumer engagement, we've started to leverage our early learnings to test generative AI across multiple areas of our business from copy editing and graphics to computer programming. Total company adjusted comparable gross margin was about flat in constant currency, in line with our guidance. Tailwinds from product mix elevation, AUR growth of 12% and lower air freight were offset by peak levels of raw material costs, notably cotton, targeted promotions to drive conversion with our more value-oriented consumers and keep inventories healthy and higher duties in Europe. Finally, freight turned to a 100 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter compared to an 80 basis point headwind for the full year. Despite cost turbulence, our adjusted gross margins are tracking ahead of fiscal '19 pre-pandemic levels and were 170 basis points higher in the fourth quarter and 320 basis points higher for the full year. Adjusted comparable operating margin was 6.1% in constant currency or 390 basis points increased to last year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 380 basis points to last year in constant currency. Marketing was 6% of sales on a more normalized cadence of planned spending compared to 10% in the prior year period. Full year marketing was 7% of sales, in line with our annual guidance as we continue to invest in key brand moments and innovative new platforms. Adjusted operating profit grew approximately 200% in the quarter. Moving to segment performance. The shift of post-Christmas sales from Q4 last year into Q3 this year had a disproportionate impact on both North America and Europe's fourth quarter results, particularly our retail channels. This shift represented about a 270 basis points of headwind to revenue growth in North America and 120 basis points impact on Europe. Starting with North America. Fourth quarter revenues increased 2%. Stronger wholesale growth was partially offset by retail headwinds. In North America retail, fourth quarter comps declined 4% on top of a strong 21% compared last year. Similar to recent trends, strong growth in our full-price stores was offset by softer performance in outlet and digital. North America retail AUR increased another mid-single digits on top of a robust 20% growth last year, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts around product, distribution and marketing. This helped to mitigate targeted promotion focused on our more value-oriented consumers. Looking ahead, we expect the subsegment of consumers to remain more sensitive to near-term inflationary pressures and this is reflected in our continued caution through fiscal '24. Beyond these headwinds, we are confident in the region's long-term trajectory which was reinforced by improving North America brand health metrics this past year with our strongest growth in brand awareness, perception of value for money and luxury perception. In North America wholesale, revenues grew low double digits to last year as we return to a more normalized cadence of spring deliveries following last year's supply chain disruptions. This benefited our Q4 by about 12 points, and we'll have a roughly 13-point negative impact on our first quarter wholesale growth. Adjusting for the normalized shipment cadence, this implies underlying wholesale revenue flat to last year, similar to Q3 trends. Our wholesale AUR increased high single digits to last year as we continue to elevate product and take market share at key partners. The promotion cadence at wholesale was flat to last year, in line with our expectations. Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 7% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 8% on top of a 77% post-COVID reopening comp last year. Brick-and-mortar comps were up 9%, driven by positive growth in both full-price stores and outlets, while digital comps grew mid-single digits. Europe AUR increased double digits in the quarter with strong growth across channels. Europe wholesale grew 3% in constant currency. This was ahead of our expectations. However, we remain cautious on the channel into fiscal '24 on softening reorder rates and digital pure-play performance, consistent with our previous comments. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 29% in constant currency, ahead of our expectations with broad-based growth across each of our key markets led by China. China rebounded strongly to more than 40% growth in constant dollars following the loosening of the Zero COVID policies in the previous quarter, with consumers traveling domestically for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Our brand continues to show momentum following a strong Lunar New Year holiday. Korea and Japan also grew double digits on compelling assortments and brand engagement and as Japan lapped last year's COVID states of emergency. Despite meaningful COVID disruptions and foreign currency headwinds through this year, we delivered our highest ever operating profit in Asia in fiscal '23. This is a testament to the growing desirability and momentum of our brand, along with the agility of our teams as they continue to drive our key city ecosystem strategy across the region. Within our other segment, licensing grew low single digits this quarter, slightly above our plan with encouraging results from our Chaps license and Polo Women's intimates launch. Looking ahead, we will fully transition out of our Lauren Men's suiting license in fiscal '24. While this will negatively impact our licensing revenues and overall company margins by about 20 basis points in fiscal '24, the move is consistent with our brand elevation strategy. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our fortress foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders. We ended this year with $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We returned $653 million in the form of our dividends and share repurchases this year, consistent with our long-term targets. Net inventory increased 10% with growth moderating significantly on a sequential basis as we reduced goods in transit and return to a more normalized lead times following last year's supply chain disruptions. Inventory growth still reflects higher product costs and our ongoing strategy of product mix elevation. Inventory units declined approximately 5% to last year, and are healthy as we enter fiscal '24. That said, we continue to manage our inventory positions carefully, with the majority of our products still weighted to core and seasonless product that can be flexed with demand. Looking to fiscal '24, we expect inventory levels to continue to moderate through the year and ending below prior year levels. Looking ahead, our outlook contemplates a more pressured consumer spending environment, dynamic macroeconomic conditions and foreign currency volatility, among others. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios and our guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts. We are taking a pragmatic approach to our plan for this year which assumes continued momentum in the full-price channels and Asia, balanced with a more challenged value consumer backdrop in North America and Europe. With an intense focus on what we control from our core iconic products and continued investments in new consumer acquisition to judicious inventory planning and operating expense discipline, we remain committed to driving progress on our long-term growth and profitability trajectory despite the dynamic global environment. Importantly, we expect to deliver both revenue growth and margin expansion this year. For fiscal '24, we are guiding constant currency revenues to increase low single digits and foreign currency to benefit reported revenues by about 20 basis points. We currently expect growth to be led by Asia, up double digits followed by low single-digit growth in Europe and a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends and Q1 wholesale timing shifts. We expect operating margin to expand approximately 30 basis points to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%, driven by gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Foreign currency is expected to benefit operating margin by about 10 basis points this year. Relative to our Investor Day base period, this guidance implies about 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant, on track with our long-term targets. We expect gross margin to benefit from lower freight costs, continued AUR growth and favorable product, geographic and channel mix this year. Reduced freight costs are expected to benefit gross margin by at least 100 basis points this year. We expect these tailwinds to be partially offset by about 20 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, along with continued pressure from product costs, notably cotton, through the majority of the year. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be flat to up slightly in constant currency. On a reported basis, including 150 basis points of currency headwind, we expect revenues to be down slightly. First quarter also includes approximately 220 basis points of negative impact from the normalized timing of spring wholesale shipments following last year's supply chain disruption noted earlier. The timing shift is expected to negatively impact our North America growth by about 5 points and North America wholesale growth by about 13 points before returning to more normalized trends in Q2. We expect first quarter operating margin expansion of about 30 basis points to 50 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. We expect gross margins to be driven by lower freight, positive AUR growth and lower wholesale mix, partially offset by higher product costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact both operating and gross margins by about 50 basis points in the quarter. From a cadence perspective, we currently expect operating margin to decline in Q2 due to the timing of planned marketing and ecosystem investments and expand again in Q3 and Q4 to last year. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25% for the full year and roughly 23% to 24% for the first quarter. And lastly, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million, in line with our long-term guidance of 4% to 5% of sales. In closing, led by Ralph's enduring vision, our brand continues to inspire consumers across every geography. Our dedicated passionate teams around the world are operating with commitment and agility to execute on our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan. We believe our elevated brand, clear strategy and targeted investments combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress foundation enablers put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator :  The first question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Matt Boss : Congrats on a really nice quarter. So Patrice, how are you feeling today about your long-term Investor Day guidance exiting year one? And can you help put us into context, just given the more challenged North American and European consumer that you called out for this year in the outlook? And then, Jane, could you just elaborate on your confidence in pricing power for the brand as you cited strong AUR as a continued driver for your gross margin outlook in FY '24? Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Matt, and good morning. Well, let me first reground us in the fact that we just finished an above algorithm year on revenue and on track on profit. So we continue to build our business for the long term. And this past year's progress puts us on the path to deliver on our long-term plan. So to answer your question very simply, our long-term ambitions have not changed. And this confidence is really grounded in a number of unique strengths which are particularly relevant in choppier environments. First of all, a brand that people love and desire that we are continuing to invest in. Second, core products that consumers know and trust that aren't based on seasonal fashion or trends. And we know that during choppier times, consumers tend to gravitate back to these more iconic categories and iconic products. And so for us here, think about Polo shirts, Oxford shirts, blazers, dresses and even ties are back. Third is strong operational fundamentals, which I think have been demonstrated throughout the past few years. Fourth is multiple growth levers, and you saw that play out in this quarter again. And then finally, a proven ability to flex to consumer demand. So these factors give us broad confidence that we continue to be on track with the goals that we laid out about 9 months ago. Now let me offer some perspective on how we're thinking about the consumer overall to the second part of your question, and I know this is a top of mind question for many of you on this call. First of all, I would say our core consumer is resilient. And we are seeing that around the world in Asia, in Europe and here in North America as well. And that segment is growing as we're bringing in new consumers into the Ralph Lauren family. The second point is that our consumers across every region are also responding well to our continued brand elevation strategy. This is evidenced by the fact that our brand desirability continues to strengthen, our value perception is growing, and we track this on a quarterly basis in our key markets. We're recruiting millions of new consumers, 5.2 million this past fiscal year, including growing our highest value consumers double digits, which we're particularly excited about. And all of this while expanding AUR plus 12% this quarter, plus 77% over the past 5 years. The third point I would call out is that we saw a lot of work to grow our consumer base outside of North America. And today, nearly half of our business is international and actually more than half of our profit is international. And as you saw in the last fiscal year, and particularly this last quarter, our Asia performance has been a real highlight. I'm very proud of the work that our teams have done across Asia and in particular, in China and we anticipate another year of above algorithm growth there, broader Asia. And then finally, in North America specifically, there is continued divergence between our core high-value consumers and that subset us more value-oriented consumers that we called out in prior quarter. Clearly, those more value-oriented consumers for a smaller part of our customer base and getting smaller and smaller as we bring in higher -- more higher value consumers into the Ralph Lauren family are feeling increased pressure because of inflation, because of increased interest rates. And I think you've heard this from others as well. But we believe we've appropriately embedded this caution into our guide. So Matt, we know where we're headed. We feel good about the multiple drivers in place to get there. I think we have a strong track record as a team in the business, and we'll manage this year with agility again. Jane, over to you on pricing power. Jane Nielsen : Yes. Thank you. So Matt, I would say an emphatic yes. We have pricing power that we expect to continue into the future. And I can't think of a better proof point than we saw this year, putting up 12% AUR growth to offset inflation. But importantly, I think we are uniquely positioned as we go forward because our pricing power is grounded in our brand elevation journey, and a proven multiyear strategy of executing a pricing strategy with multiple levers, not just like-for-like pricing, but product elevation, category momentum and movement, structural geographic advantages that we have that are coming through in our consumer metrics. Our consumer value perception has never been higher despite the price increases that we've taken. Our perception as a luxury brand has continued to grow and continues to grow and is certainly where our strategy intends to continue. And our model gives us flexibility because we are keenly aware of where we are in the macroeconomic time frame. But our pricing model in its multiple levels gives us flexibility to meet consumers where they are, all while still elevating the brand and you'll see us do that into the coming year. Operator : The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : I have a two-part question. The first part really follows up on some of the pricing comments you just made. How does this more pressured macro environment impact your overall brand elevation strategy. Are you taking a more flexible approach to pricing or discounting in this backdrop? And then the second question is, Jane, you talked about the fortress balance sheet the company has. How is that going to let you play offense? Patrice, I've heard you used this comment that you can play offense through this tough economic environment. But what does it going to allow you to do both from an operational standpoint and a sort of a return cash to shareholder standpoint in fiscal '24? Patrice Louvet : So I think it is fair to say that the environment has been more pressured. And listen, we expect it to stay volatile as we come into this new fiscal year. We are still -- you just heard that from Jane, we're still firmly committed to our elevation strategy, which we started well before COVID over 5 years ago. And why? Because it's working. The strategy has served us well through stronger and weaker macro backdrops. We're seeing strong consumer response to what we are doing. And I think it's pretty clear also to Matt's earlier question that our brands continue to have strong pricing power in the marketplace across every region, right? You saw AUR grew across every single region this past fiscal year, in this past quarter. And we believe this is becoming an even bigger differentiator for Ralph Lauren relative to peers in this environment. And we are guided by the consumer here, right? And as Jane mentioned, the consumer response to our brand elevation on product, on storytelling, on selling environment continues to be strong. And the AUR is an outcome of all of that, and we feel quite good about our ability to continue on this journey, and then Jane, I'll turn it over to you for some more color on the second part of Jay's question. Jane Nielsen : Sure. And Jay, I would just add to what Patrice said on our pricing journey, that you've seen us in the last 2 quarters to be flexible while still putting up double-digit AUR growth, be flexible to the need of the more value-oriented consumer. And as we think about the coming year, we've built that flexibility into the model based on what we're seeing in consumer trends. So we feel really good about that flexibility while still continuing obviously to elevate even in a difficult environment. And then your question on the balance sheet. The balance sheet honestly gives us the flexibility to be brave and do what we need to do for our business. So you saw us during COVID be able to hold inventory when demand was a little softer. The strength of our brands have such a core assortment allowed us to do that and to make sure that we could continue our elevation journey and not be forced in discounting. It allows us to be brave in investing during times of volatility, both in marketing, which you've seen us do consistently through this reset period, and we intend to continue to do even in our guidance today, we expect marketing to be up 7% -- to be up to 7% of sales as we move into the future and to invest ahead of return on growth drivers. You saw us do that on digital, invest in local sites that take some time to pay off, but are good for the long-term health of the brand and consumer outreach and invest in doors that we know will be a halo to the brand, attract consumers and be good investments over time. So we really do believe in it as an enabler. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. John Kernan : Congrats for a nice quarter. Can you talk to just North America, in particular, a lot of us can see the macro environment here getting a little bit more difficult as we went through the spring. Just wondering what you're seeing in both the wholesale channel in North America, also the outlet retail channel and how that is informing your view for North America embedded in the guidance this year. Jane Nielsen : So what we see in wholesale is that, as we called out in the guidance, we do see a normalization of wholesale sales that were disrupted during the supply chain. And we expect that to be a heavy headwind in the first quarter. Now that's anomalous. We want to call it out. But underlying in terms of wholesale, we have seen some challenges in terms of replenishment orders and some caution in their more value-oriented consumers. So we've taken that into consideration as we've planned our inventories and know that they're taking a more cautious stance in both North America and in Europe, as they give us order -- as they place orders for receipts into spring. We've incorporated that into our guidance. We're more optimistic about certainly, what we've seen in our full-price store environment in North America, it's remained strong through this period, and we're encouraged by that. We are more cautious as we came into the fourth quarter in terms of the outlet consumer. We've been calling that out for several quarters, and we've incorporated that into our guidance as well. We are encouraged that we do see that all our consumers migrating up in terms of the categories that they're buying into. They're buying higher ticket items. Those value consumers are looking for a good deal, but we do see that migration up in terms of the product assortment, and we're adjusting our assortments accordingly. We did see basket growth and AUR growth across all our channels and are encouraged by that. We will follow that while being flexible for the consumers. But encouraged by the overall store environment, and we feel we have the tools to flexibly move through this environment. Patrice Louvet : And then wholesale, I would add to that perspective that the brand elevation strategy that we're applying is playing out well in the wholesale environment in the U.S. Jane, you mentioned AUR. AUR up 8% in wholesale this past quarter in a relatively promotional environment. Over the long term, we've been growing share in Men's, in Women's, particularly strength recently in Women's and in Children's. And I think we're nicely aligned with the strategic direction of our key wholesale partners. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. Chris Nardone : To dive a little bit deeper into your outlook for your European wholesale business and also your direct-to-consumer business this year, in particular, how should we think about the slowdown you're seeing in digital business and how does that compare to maybe some of the underlying trends in your brick-and-mortar channel? Jane Nielsen : So broadly across Europe, we've been very pleased with our digital progress. We're up substantially in terms of where we were pre-COVID, it's been a source of strength for us. In terms of what we're seeing on our digital growth, we expect continued growth in digital at a more moderate pace for Europe, but continuing our AUR journey in that channel and strong performance. As we look at the wholesale channel in Europe, it is more elevated and healthier than what we've seen in North America but we have seen pressure from pure players. Now that's playing out in our digital ecosystem in Europe, and it's playing out in our wholesale business in Europe. We have adjusted our inventories accordingly and expect to continue to grow with them in the long term, but do see pressure in the near term from the pure players that will play both into our digital ecosystem growth and will -- and plays out in terms of our total wholesale growth in Europe. But overall, it's an elevated offer. We continue to like our market share gains in that channel and are continuing the journey, but the pure plays are the pressure point. Patrice Louvet : And I would add that our biggest partner there is Zalando in Europe. Zalando is on the brand elevation strategy, pulling back on promotional activity and that's very consistent with where we want to take the brand in Europe. So strategically, we feel very good about the direction that Zalando is taking. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Two items that were called out is one, marketing spend and one on raw material costs. How are those being planned in -- what does it look like for fiscal '24 compared to '23? And then Patrice, would love to hear your take, just expand a little bit on wholesale. How do you see the difference in the wholesale channel operating models, North America versus Europe versus Asia? And how you're planning the business? Patrice Louvet : Maybe tack team on this. On marketing spend, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, our strategy is to spend about 7% of revenue on marketing. That's roughly where we were this past fiscal year. That's where we will be this coming fiscal year. It won't necessarily play out exactly per quarter at 7% because obviously, we have fashion shows and those types of events that will skew the numbers in a particular quarter. But directionally, 7% of revenue, we expect modest revenue growth, so you can expect the absolute dollars of marketing spend to increase on the total brand. Jane, I'll let you do the raw materials. Jane Nielsen : Dana, what we see in raw materials is really actually encouraging. What we see in terms of tailwinds is that freight will go from about an 80 basis point headwind in fiscal '23 to about 100 basis point tailwind in fiscal '24. Now as we called out cotton inflation was at its peak in Q4 and we expect that to continue into Q1. But as we exit the year -- because we're long bought on cotton, about a year out. But as we exit the year, at the very end of the year, we will start to see cotton turn to an advantage in terms of raw materials. But we really won't realize that until fiscal '25. And so if you think about it in the big buckets, cotton and freight will sort of equalize each other. But we do see some other tailwinds in terms of our air freight is stabilized and won't be a pressure point. We expect to see continued product elevation and mix and structural advantages as Asia outgrows or leads to the growth from the rest of our regions. So we're very encouraged by what we can see and what we have visibility to now relative to the environment that we faced in fiscal '23. Patrice Louvet : And then your question on wholesale. So just stepping back a little bit, our direction of travel from a strategic standpoint is to pivot the company further into DTC. Our DTC today is about 63%, 64% of -- for the total company. And as we guided during Investor Day, we expect the numbers to be north of that in the coming years. Now we believe wholesale -- quality wholesale has an important role to play in our go-to-market model as well. If you do the world tour, in Asia, most of our business, if not all of it, is concession. So to a large sense, actually a DTC business. It's nicely elevated. We had really nice momentum there, as you saw in the results that we just announced. And so we're focused on running the play and continuing to drive elevation there. In Europe, it is a mix of concessions and wholesale. And in Europe, what we're working on is continued elevation. There's been some really nice work done in Germany, in France, we're looking very good in France and had really nice performance this past year in France wholesale in the U.K. In Southern Europe, there's opportunity to elevate. So we're putting emphasis on customers like El Corte Ingles, right, to make sure that we show up the way we want to show up in the appropriate doors. And then as we were just talking earlier and Jane mentioned some of this on pure players, pure players are an important part of our wholesale business today. It will be even more important in the future. And I'm actually quite excited about some of the strategic pivots that some of the European pure players are doing because it really lines up nicely with our strategic approach. And I refer to an example earlier on that. And then as far as North America is concerned, kind of 2 tiers of wholesale last, right? Remember, we closed 66% of our wholesale doors over the past 3 or 4 years. The upper tier is performing quite strongly, and we feel good about the way we're positioned there. So think of the Saks in the Blooming deals of this world and consistent with what we talked about our core luxury consumer being quite resilient. As far as the premium tier is concerned, our focus is on share gain. These are players, I think that I would say if they were on this call that they're picking between the winners and the losers and they're putting investment behind the winners and pulling back on the losers. We are fortunate to be part of that winner's column based on our performance over the past few years, share growth, value creation, joint value creation with them. So we are benefiting from staffing investments from these partners. We're benefiting from capital investments from these partners as we continue to elevate our brand presence in these more limited doors given the number of doors that we've closed. And our focus is on share gain, right? And as I mentioned earlier, over the longer term, we are growing share across all 3 of our segments, and we have a number of initiatives in place to continue to drive that while driving brand elevation. And I'm pleased to see that our AUR was up 8%, high single digits, up 8% this past quarter, in an environment that's still relatively promotional. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a sense of how we're thinking about the broader go-to-market strategy moving forward. Operator : The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Congrats on a great quarter and a full year. Jane, I would love to get a little bit more color. Thanks for Dana's question on the bridge on the gross margin. But on the first quarter, can you maybe just kind of give us a little bit of a bracket on how we should think about gross margins? And then second, just following up on the Investor Day, I think you talked about $400 million plus of gross productivity gains. I think 2/3 of that coming from SG&A. Can you maybe just tell us or share with us any further insights or any further confidence you have to achieve those productivity gains. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Let me just start with the gross margin guidance. First of all, I just want to be clear, our Investor Day guidance on gross margin is unchanged. And I think our guidance both this year and this quarter reaffirms that we will be back on track for making gross margin progress. As you think about the first quarter, some of the things that we have that will, for gross margin expansion of 50 basis points to 100 basis points will play out in the first quarter. We expect that we will still have some pressure from FX in the first quarter. And -- but we are very encouraged by our pricing power and by the plans that we have, that we'll be able to expand gross margin 30 basis points to 50 basis points across the business. We have the AUR plans in place. We're basically offsetting inflation and we're continuing our journey to increase our both our category penetration in high-margin categories and our product penetration in the upper tiers of our product assortment. So we're very encouraged by that and expect the -- you'll start to see the progress that we've called out for fiscal '24 in Q1. And as we think about the $400 million that we committed to in Investor Day, we have achieved in fiscal '23, about 1/3 of that $400 million. So we're right on track for where we want to be. We expect another 1/3 or perhaps a little bit more in this year, in this FY '24. And so we're right on track with where we want to be for that $400 million commitment. We've -- we're on pace. And of course, as a cost discipline muscle, we are always looking for more. So we have a number of initiatives. I called out some in terms of AI that we're continuing to develop as we move forward and hope to overachieve as we move into -- through the strategic planning time line. Patrice Louvet : All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to engaging with you at our Annual Shareholder Meeting and first quarter fiscal '241 earnings call in early August. Until then, take good care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Corey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We started year two of our next great Chapter Accelerate plan with continued progress on our long-term strategic commitments. Our solid first quarter performance highlights both the power of our iconic brand around the world and our diversified engines of growth. First quarter results exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line in what continues to be a highly dynamic global operating environment. We delivered positive comps, stronger value perception and luxury credentials and targeted ecosystem expansion across our top cities in the period. Our growing brand desirability also drove double-digit AUR growth on top of last year's strong gains. And we will continue to invest in our product quality and sustainability, selling environments and authentic brand messaging to sustain our growth and long-term pricing power in the marketplace. At the same time, we continue to balance this growth with a relentless focus on agility and operational discipline to respond to evolving market dynamics. This enables our operating profit and margin expansion even as we invest for the long-term. We continue to be mindful of macro inflationary challenges facing our more value-oriented consumers, particularly in North America. That said, we are more than offsetting softness from this cohort with growth in our full price businesses. Turning to the first quarter. Our solid performance was guided by our 3 strategic pillars to drive long-term growth and value creation. These are, first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand, second, drive the core and expand for more, and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We are investing in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic brand to inspire and engage our consumers, drive brand desirability in the market and ultimately grow lifetime value. We continue to diversify and optimize our marketing across a variety of media and platforms as we deliver a clear, differentiated story to our target consumers in order to trade them in, across and up our lifestyle portfolio. During the quarter, first, we drove some of our highest engagements globally through iconic celebrity dressing moments. This was led by Jennifer Lopez at the Met Gala in May, delivering over 8 billion global media impressions and her look landed on multiple best dress lists across TV, digital, social and print outlets. Other celebrity highlights included Taylor Swift, spotted on the streets of New York in our Wellington bag and all white Polo Ensemble; Singer and Actress, Crystal Young in Cannes. First Lady, Jill Biden at the Coronation of King Charles. And you may have caught a recent episode of, And Just Like That, which features characters Charlotte and Rock, outfitted in Ralph Lauren at a fun fictional polo photo shoot, highlighting the multigenerational appeal of our brand. Second, we have worked to reinforce our luxury lifestyle positioning through iconic lifestyle partnerships and activations in key global cities. We paired our recent Milan flagship openings with key campaigns to fuel excitement in this influential fashion capital this spring. This included the return of men's Purple Label to Milan Fashion Week in June and our second annual participation at Salone del Mobile, part of Milan Design Week, where we showcased our emerging home business. Similarly, across Europe and Asia, we drove brand heat through experiential events like our California Dreaming key city takeovers, exclusive private client events and influencer campaigns to build our presence in both new and existing ecosystems from Paris to Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul. And most recently, we reinforced our leadership in the world of sports with another successful Wimbledon sponsorship, where we delivered our highest ever results on social conversations on-site merchandise sales and global PR impressions. Ralph Lauren truly embodies the heritage and tradition of this iconic tournament. In addition to our beautiful Encore presence, we also captured our iconic spectator style on celebrities and influencers like Ariana Grande and David Beckham, which we amplified globally. Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers, while also attracting new high-value consumers to our business. In our DTC businesses, we added 1.2 million new consumers in the first quarter consistent with recent trends. This continues to skew increasingly toward next-generation under 35 consumers. And we reached 53.5 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year driven by Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. And our online search trends continue to outpace our peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories. Moving to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. Ralph and our design teams continue to create sophisticated timeless products that meet our customers' modern lifestyle, underpinned by the quiet luxury that is a hallmark of our brand. Starting with our iconic core products, which typically represent about 70% of sales and are a consistent driver of our business, season after season. Our core grew mid-single digits in the first quarter, ahead of total company growth and penetration to total sales increased by 350 basis points, underscoring the importance and resilience of our icons through choppier times. This was led by our iconic cable knit sweaters and cardigans, linen shirts and chinos, double net sweatshirts, rugby shirts and tailored suit separates. We continue to see evidence that consumers are turning to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond one season. Our roots in quality and timeless style remain a competitive advantage in this context, supporting our strengthening value proposition. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's, outerwear and our emerging home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits in the quarter. Women's, our largest long-term opportunity, continues to outpace total company performance, supported by our Spring '23 California Dreaming collection inspired by the natural beauty, optimism and glamor of the West Coast, Polos, day dresses and lightweight skirts in seasonal florals and silks, newer wide-like bottoms and encouraging growth in our Polo ID handbags. Other special releases this quarter included the launch of our Polo Mirum sneaker, our first luxury sneaker that is 100% plastic-free. Leveraging our investment in natural fiber welding, Mirum is made with an innovative combination of natural rubber, cotton, cork and plant oil. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to meet consumers' evolving lifestyles. Switching to our third key initiatives, winning key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We remain committed to developing our key city ecosystems around the world, with a focus on elevating and connecting all of our consumer touch points across every channel. At the same time, we are clearly pivoting our business toward direct-to-consumer, which already represents about 2/3rds of our sales. Our investments in high-quality new customer recruitment and increasingly elevated distribution are working. Our full-price retail channels led the growth in the quarter, consistent with recent trends. This is helping to mitigate near-term inflationary headwinds facing a subsegment of more value-sensitive consumers. Our positive retail comps were supported by continued momentum in our core Polo products and luxury collections, along with improving foreign tourist sales and successful clienteling by our dedicated sales teams. This performance more than offset continued pressure in our outlet comps, which were challenged by a more promotional North American market. We opened a select number of iconic World of Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, notably in Amsterdam, Tainan and Kuala Lumpur, featuring an elevated assortment and prime luxury adjacencies. These stores are designed to anchor our city presence and drive desirability and engagement with consumers. We opened a total of 28 new stores and concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter, with the majority again in Asia, particularly in China. China sales accelerated to more than 50% growth with easier compares following last year's Shanghai lockdowns. We were particularly encouraged by our strong 6/18 performance, which outpaced peers and reinforced our new customer acquisition in the market. And over 40% of our transactions were generated from new consumers. Looking ahead, we still expect China to remain one of our fastest-growing markets. Within our digital businesses, sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce were flat this quarter. Strong growth in our international markets more than offset declines in North America, where the digital channel has also become more promotional. This quarter's digital performance was clearly below our long-term targets, and we implemented key interventions during the quarter, which will continue into the fall season. Encouragingly, we started to see improvement in our North America digital trends from June onward, as Jane will discuss in a moment. And finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. As part of our ongoing work to deliver superior operational capabilities, we are implementing process improvements and new tools to streamline our value chain and drive long-term margin opportunities. Our recent work has resulted in a 25% reduction in our overall Spring '24 SKU count, even as we continue to develop our high-potential categories. Within citizenship and sustainability, we were proud to be recognized as a top-rated ESG performer by Sustainalytics as we work to embed sustainability in all we do. And within our people and culture, we were recently named a best company for women to advance by parity.org for the fourth consecutive year. In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's solid start to this fiscal year. We continue to focus on offense, agility and pragmatism in these dynamic times. And we believe Ralph Lauren is firmly in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments. Underpinned by Ralph's timeless vision and the strength of our iconic brand, we have diversified levers of growth across geography, channel and category, a broad lifestyle portfolio of products that consumers know and trust and that we are actively flexing with consumer needs, and strong foundational enablers to support long-term growth and value creation from our talented people, innovative technology and supply chain to our balance sheet and muscle of operational discipline. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid start to fiscal '24, with first quarter results ahead of our expectations. This quarter's performance demonstrates the broad-based strength of our strategy and the agility of our teams in a highly dynamic global operating environment. This gives us confidence in delivering on both our long-term commitments as well as the fiscal '24 outlook we outlined in May. We drove positive first quarter revenue growth, exceeding our guidance. We returned to gross margin expansion this quarter with clean inventories, all while overcoming peak raw material costs and our culture of cost discipline enabled us to deliver 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 13.7%, with operating profit dollars up 9%. We continue to make important investments in our business while delivering strong shareholder returns, including roughly $100 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases this quarter. Our first quarter financial performance underscores our position of strength through dynamic times. Let me take you through some of the highlights from the quarter. Total company revenues in the first quarter increased 1% above our outlook. Strong performance in Europe and Asia more than offset a decline in North America, which was negatively impacted by a wholesale timing shift into the prior quarter, as noted on our last call. Our digital ecosystem sales were about flat with growth in international offsetting a decline in North America. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points versus last year to 69.3%. This was above our outlook, driven by lower freight expense and 15% AUR growth, along with favorable channel, geographic and product mix. The cost of raw materials, notably cotton, continued to be a headwind in the quarter as expected. Looking ahead, we plan to continue leveraging price to offset cost inflation, which will moderate this fall from peak spring '23 levels. As a reminder, our long-term approach to AUR continues to be a multipronged strategy driven by product mix elevation, more personalized and targeted promotion, select like-for-like increases based on competitive benchmarking, disciplined inventory management to limit excess and favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. We expect these drivers to continue delivering positive, albeit a more modest level of AUR growth longer term. Adjusted operating expenses increased 40 basis points to 55.6% of sales in the first quarter. Marketing was 6% of sales compared to 7% last year. As noted on our last call, we are shifting a higher proportion of marketing and ecosystem investments into the second quarter of this fiscal year, driving expense deleverage in Q2. However, we continue to expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales, consistent with our long-term guidance. Moving to segment performance, starting with North America. First quarter revenues decreased 10%. This included about 5 points of negative impact from the normalized timing of spring wholesale shipments following last year's supply chain disruption, as previously noted. The rest of the decline was largely driven by continued inflationary pressures on our more value-oriented consumers. In North America Retail, first quarter comps declined 6%, following a 5% increase last year. We continued to deliver strong growth in our Ralph Lauren stores while performance was softer than expected in outlet and digital. In our channels with exposure to value-oriented consumers, notably outlet, inflation continues to pressure consumer spending and the competitive set has grown increasingly promotional. Our North American digital business was also pressured in April and May. However, we delivered improved trends toward the end of June, as we implemented key actions to improve our sales and conversion in the channel. Looking ahead, we expect to drive modest sequential improvement in our retail business through the rest of fiscal '24. We have proactively adjusted our Fall '23 buys to focus on our core. We are launching new digital enhancements as well as our Canada digital flagship this fall. And we are making key investments in personalized communication and leveraging selective promotions to drive conversion and keep inventories healthy. These actions remain consistent with our initial guidance for fiscal '24. In North America Wholesale, revenues decreased mid-teens to last year. The return to a normalized cadence of spring deliveries had a 12-point negative impact on our growth in the channel this quarter. Our wholesale AUR increased 11% as we continued to elevate our product mix while keeping our wholesale inventories clean. We remain cautious on the channel through the rest of this year on softer reorders and broader challenges in the channel. Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenues increased 7%, while this was ahead of our expectations, the first quarter included a roughly 5-point benefit from earlier timing of Fall '23 wholesale deliveries. Retail comps were up 2% on top of a strong 34% compared to last year, which benefited from a sales resurgence post-Omicron. Brick-and-mortar comps rose 1%, led by Ralph Lauren stores. Europe AUR increased mid-teens in the quarter. Our Europe's digital ecosystem grew mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by an 8% comp in our own digital commerce and the wholesale timing shift, which also benefited our digital accounts. Europe wholesale increased 11%, driven by the earlier fall shipments. While this timing shift will negatively impact our wholesale sell-ins by an estimated 4 points in both Q2 and Q3, respectively, it should also position us well to capture full price sales in season. Aside from the wholesale timing shifts, we are maintaining our full year fiscal '24 Europe outlook of low single-digit growth reflecting our continued caution on the macro environment and digital wholesale channel. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 18% with growth across each of our key markets, led again by China. China accelerated to more than 50% growth as we lap significant COVID-related restrictions in the prior year period. Our brands demonstrated strong momentum during the Golden Week and 6/18 Festival. First quarter sales in Japan increased high-single digits despite a slow recovery in inbound tourism and our continued near-term caution on the market. Within our other nonreportable segments licensing revenue declined high single digits, in line with our plan. The decline reflects the previously disclosed transition out of our Lauren Men's suiting license as part of our broader brand elevation strategy. The exit will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of the fiscal year until we lap it in fiscal '25. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our Fortress Foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We are tightly controlling our inventory levels and driving efficiencies with net inventory up 1% this quarter, in line with our top line growth. Increases in Asia and Europe were largely offset by a high single-digit decline in North American inventories. We expect second quarter inventory growth to continue moderating, which should position our brands well ahead of the important holiday season. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and other consumer spending-related headwinds and foreign currency volatility among others. For fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact reported revenues by about 20 basis points due to unfavorable shifts in Asian exchange rates versus our prior outlook. We continue to expect top-line growth to be led by Asia, up double digits, followed by low single-digit growth in Europe. We still expect a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends in the first half and wholesale timing shifts in Q1. We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is expected to have a roughly neutral impact on full year operating margin. We now expect gross margin to expand about 100 basis points with reduced freight costs, favorable geographic and channel mix and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting cotton inflation. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset higher operating expenses as we invest in the key strategic initiatives outlined at Investor Day, particularly around digital and key city ecosystem expansion as well as marketing and sustainability. Relative to our Investor Day base period, guidance implies about 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant, on track with our long-term targets. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be flat to slightly up in constant currency, led by growth in Asia. We remain cautious on North America but expect sequential improvement following Q1's negative timing shifts. Conversely, we expect second quarter Europe and digital ecosystem sales to be sequentially weaker, both due to the earlier fall shipments reported in Q1. Excluding the shift, we expect underlying trends in Europe to be more in line with our full year outlook for the region of low single-digit growth. We expect second quarter operating margin in the range of 9% to 9.5% in constant currency and 9.5% to 10% on a reported basis. We expect constant currency gross margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points to be more than offset by higher operating expenses due to the timing of strategic investments as previously indicated. This includes key digital ecosystem and marketing investments, notably the shift of our fashion show into the second quarter from the third quarter of last year. From a cadence perspective, our outlook implies stronger revenue growth in the second half of the year, driven by our merchandising actions, marketing activations for fall holiday and the investments just noted. In addition, we will start to lap negative inflationary impacts from the second half of last year. We continue to expect operating margins to expand in Q3 and Q4 and for the full year on both a reported and constant currency basis. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the full year and roughly 21% to 22% for the second quarter. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. In closing, inspired by Ralph's enduring vision. Our teams around the world continue to demonstrate agility and dedication every day as we execute on our next great chapter, Accelerate plan. While we remain acutely attuned to the near-term challenges facing certain areas of our business, we believe in our strategic priorities, investing in lifelong consumer relationships, leveraging our powerful core products in high potential categories and developing our key city ecosystems. These priorities, combined with our passionate teams, put us in a position of strength to continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Matt Boss : So Patrice, to take a step back, your first quarter total company results outperformed expectations on a consolidated basis. But your first quarter and your outlook are still below the long-term guidance for North America. So do you believe you can still achieve your long-term Investor Day top line algorithm? And then Jane, any change or just what is your confidence in mid-teens operating margins next year for the company? Patrice Louvet : Mike, thank you for your question. Yes, first of all, overall, our teams did a very good job delivering on our top and bottom-line commitments. For this quarter, even with ongoing challenging backdrops across the different regions. As you know, our strategy has multiple growth engines, meaning resilience is embedded in our strategy and in our plan. If you look at it across regions and then we'll zoom into North America. Our second largest business, Europe continues to hold up well despite macro headwinds. We're also feeling very good about the way our performance came in on China and broader Asia. You saw China up 50% this quarter. And while North America is facing some pressure in the near term, our core consumer, which is a more elevated consumer continues to be resilient, and we have the right strategies in place to drive growth well beyond these headwinds. In fact, a couple of data points to illustrate that. First of all, our value and also our luxury brand perception scores are growing faster in North America than any other region in the world. And if I provide additional perspective, if you look at it from a channel perspective, our emphasis and investments are in DTC and which is now about 2/3rds of our North America business and where we have the biggest growth opportunity. From a product perspective, we have multiple opportunities across high potential categories from outerwear to home and to women's more broadly. On brand, we continue to invest in new customer acquisition. You saw that this quarter again, $1.2 million overall, a good chunk of that coming from North America, as well as key brand moments like our upcoming U.S. Open partnership and our upcoming fashion show early September. And then finally, our key enablers here are also quite important. Our inventory levels are healthy. We go into back-to-school. We're going to go into holiday in a really good place. And our operating discipline and balance sheet give us the flexibility to continue investing in our growth to continue investing in our [indiscernible]. So we're also well positioned as conditions improve in North America and beyond. So I would say even with the near-term pressures, Matt, we're confident that we're in a strong position to perform and deliver over the long term, and that's really where all our focus is. Jane Nielsen : Yes. And just to follow up on the second part of your question, I would say, yes, we're on track. We are still working towards our Investor Day targets. Although our performance is likely to remain a little choppy given the volatile macroeconomic conditions, we're really encouraged by our first 5 quarters of top-line and margin progress in constant currency. Importantly, I think we feel that we have the right strategy and that our multiple engines of growth give us the flexibility to lean in where we need to and where we're strong when some parts of our business are challenged. So I think that those things are what's giving us confidence. And as we look forward, we still see opportunity to reach our long-term financial algorithm. Operator : The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : My question, Jane, is for you. The company continues to report strong AUR growth after 6 years of consecutive gains, how much further can the AUR journey continue? And how much runway do you realistically have? And then maybe if I can add a second one for Patrice. You touched on high potential categories in the prepared remarks. Can you just kind of take us into a little bit deeper dive on that and just tell us what's changed over the 90 days, the last 90 days, give you more confidence that those categories can be meaningful revenue growth drivers for the company over the next year plus? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thanks for the question, Jay. Stepping back a bit, we are really confident in our long-term brand elevation journey. As we said at Investor Day, we have three key drivers of long-term revenue growth, new customer recruiting, select unit growth and AUR growth. So with regards to your question and AUR specifically, we're confident in our AUR strategy and expect our multipronged approach to drive continued, albeit a more moderate level of AUR growth as we look ahead. You've seen us elevate across products, the consumer experience, stores and our brand positioning. And AUR is an output of this journey. Importantly, as we've elevated our consumer value perception metrics have continued to increase, even again this quarter. These factors taken together are really what give us confidence in our long-term AUR trajectory. That said, we're keenly aware of the current environment, and we continue to keep a really sharp focus on the value we are driving and delivering. With some of these pressures, we're seeing some of our more value-oriented consumers needless to lean in a bit more during select key consumer value-seeking moments like back-to-school and holiday and our guidance contemplates this as we move forward. As cost inflation starts to moderate ahead, we'll adjust our like-for-like pricing elements of our [AURs] [ph] strategy accordingly. And we're not expecting double-digit AUR growth every quarter from here. But overall, the elevation strategy hasn't changed, and we plan to continue AUR growth this year and beyond. Patrice Louvet : And then, Jay, on your question regarding high potential categories. We've been really pleased with the continued strength on those businesses. If you kind of zero in on the three that we called out, so outerwear, women's more broadly with handbags being an element for that. And then, also home. Those categories delivered ahead of company trend, both in Q1 and as it did last fiscal year, actually low double digits across the board. So all 3 are in a good position. The standout is clearly women's where we have fantastic momentum across all brands within our portfolio, with probably Polo being even further highlight. And I think as we look at the capabilities needed to win across all 3 of these, we feel very nicely positioned not just for the next 2 or 3 quarters, but actually for the years to come in terms of tapping into the significant growth opportunities. Operator : The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Jane, I would love to ask about the 2Q guide. I think that's where the focus is, unfortunately, near term. But just can you give us a bridge on the -- from the first quarter marketing spend I missed that number. But if you can give us a little bit more color why the operating margin will be 9.5% to 10% constant currency. And then, I saw the increase to gross margin for the full year on a CC basis. I would have expected that you saw had foresight on commodity and freight cost 90 days ago. So is the increase due to geo-mix or less promotions in the marketplace because of their inventory levels. Jane Nielsen : All right. Laurent. Could you just repeat your question on marketing, you broke up a bit. Laurent Vasilescu : So sorry about that. I'm overseas. I was asking if -- what the marketing spend was for 1Q as well as how do you think about the 2Q marketing spend because there's a shift with the fashion show. Jane Nielsen : Sure. So Laurent, as we look at the second quarter, what we're seeing is we continue to be cautious about the overall consumer environment. You'll see, as we called out in the first quarter that the wholesale timing shift in Europe will impact us in the second quarter. You will start to see sequentially from here some improvement in what you saw in North America wholesale. And in fact, as we look at North America more broadly, I think you'll see a sequential improvement while we're still cautious, sequential improvement on the top line as we move through. And just to keep in mind in our second quarter guidance, APAC is overlapping its strongest growth of the year last year as we came out of some of the COVID-related shutdowns. On the marketing side, what you'll see in terms of our spend, this first quarter, we were about 5.7% of sales. You'll see us go to 8% of sales in marketing in the second quarter. On a dollar growth basis, that will be our peak marketing dollar growth that is as our tradition, our highest dollar spend in marketing will be in Q3, aligned with the holiday quarter. And then, as we look at your question on our second quarter OI margin, what you're really seeing is in that second quarter, you'll see the impact to OI margin of the shipments in Europe into the first quarter coming out of the second quarter. Also, as we've seen some softness in North America wholesale, we've been able to lean into our DTC channel, specifically in North America, which has a gross margin benefit, which we're calling out in our full year guidance. But carries heavier SG&A expense but is OI margin neutral. And that's playing through what you're seeing in terms of expense to leverage. And that said, on SG&A expenses overall, as Patrice mentioned, we are playing offense. So we are not pulling back on our investments in our digital platforms in Q2, we are investing to make sure that we can go live on a new website in Canada and that we will implement later in the second half, a new search engine, as well as our continued advancement of store opening. So we're not backing off building growth into the future. I do understand the investments are in Q2, but these are both long-term benefits and some benefits that will play out in the second half of the year. And then just in terms of gross margin, we're confident in our gross margin guidance. Mix shift plays a small role, but we are realizing the benefits of freight, which we called out in May, will give us about 100 basis points benefit as we move through fiscal '24. That's about offset by cotton. But as we look forward to FY '25, we expect cotton to turn into a tailwind at the very end of the quarter. We're also seeing with our AUR up 15%. We're really confident in our ability to continue to elevate with AUR as an outcome of that. And we're confident in that as we move forward, although I said it will moderate as like the need for like-for-like pricing due to inflation also moderate. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : As you talk about the pressures of the value consumer and the AUR increases, what are you seeing globally that value consumer, whether in North America, Europe or in Asia versus the more higher-end consumer and helping to drive the AUR growth. Is there a difference? Patrice Louvet : Dana, so we actually are really pleased to see how our core consumer, which is a more elevated consumer is responding to our product offering, particularly as we pivot more towards sophisticated casual, which is really where the interest is at this point and which really plays to our core strengths of think chinos, suit separates, cable knit sweaters, Oxford shorts and those kind of things. And consumers responding well to that elevation and the core consumer represents the bulk of our business. And this is true both in Asia and even in China, where we have our highest AUR, we're continuing to drive AUR. But this trend in Europe, it's also true across North America. So core consumer is resilient around the world, responding well to our overall product offering and AUR expansion. As a reminder, our AUR is a combination, as Jane mentioned earlier, 4 different factors. Product mix, channel and region mix, were targeted like-for-like pricing and pull back on promotional activity. As far as the value-oriented consumer is concerned, we really see that dynamic primarily in North America. And that group is becoming a smaller and smaller part of our overall customer makeup because, as you know, as we recruit new consumers are recruiting new higher-value customers. I think what we're seeing with that customer, which frankly isn't surprising given the inflationary context is pressure on what they invest in, in terms of the choices that they make. Where we're seeing the greatest price sensitivity that is on our basic categories. which I might point the COVID categories. So we're seeing pressure on tees, on fleece, on shorts. But, overall, we're continuing the AUR expansion journey we are seeing our value perception continue to increase. So we're not just taking land pricing like maybe other players might. We are actually being very deliberate on elevating product elevating our storytelling, elevating our shopping experience, which drives value enhanced value perception, which then enables us to drive AUR, which gives us to change earlier for confidence that we can continue to do that as we continue to enhance the makeup of our customer base, higher value customers, resilient customers around the world. Dana Telsey : Okay. And then just kind of get your perspective on the wholesale channel and when you see it return to stabilization even growth go forward given the timing shifts that have occurred. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : As we look at wholesale, Dana, I think it's really a story of different regional factors. So overall, what we're expecting is that in North America, as I mentioned, Q1 will be the low point in terms of wholesale growth, and we expect to build roughly sequentially as we move through the year while exiting in flat to positive range for North America wholesale. And then with Europe, we've obviously called out that the plus 10% that we saw in Europe this quarter had some opportunities that we took for full price selling to ship in a little earlier. That will have about a 4-point impact to Europe in Q2 and Q3, but we would expect Europe overall for the year to have some flat to down low single digit in our wholesale business. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. Chris Nardone : So in terms of your North America retail business, how should we think about the level of promotional activity that you're embedding in your outlook for this upcoming holiday season compared to last year? And then, how should we think about top-line in North America retail? Should we also see potential improvement starting in 2Q? Jane Nielsen : Thanks for your question, Chris. I think what we're calling out both in our guidance and in our intent is that as Patrice mentioned, we are seeing value-oriented consumers really responding during the sort of what I would say, consumer moments. And so what we've left in our algorithm is contemplated in our guidance is some select targeted promotional activity, specifically for that value consumer. So you'll see us go sharp back to school. You'll see us be sharp in key holiday moments. Black Friday, specifically. A few days leading up to Christmas, especially Cyber Monday. But what we're calling out is that we'll continue AUR growth, albeit at a more moderate rate and AUR growth that leads to gross margin expansion. So this is not at all moving away from our brand elevation strategy. It's about being agile, responding to key consumer moments in a targeted basis. And you've seen us go to the top-end of our gross margin range. So we've got a good handle on where we need to be. And I would say that if you look at our inventories up 1% this quarter, you don't have pressure to be promotional. We want to go where the consumer is going, respond to the consumer need for value at select times, but not at all be pressured in terms of moving backwards. We're about brand elevation and AUR growth, while being smart and pragmatic in this current environment. So from North America, top-line standpoint. As we've called out and we've looked at revenue, we expect North America as we put in place some key interventions like outlet interventions that we just talked about, like the digital ecosystem investments with Canda going live in Q3. Like key brand moments like the fashion show, we expect North America revenues to increase, especially in the second half where we would expect them to be in positive territory. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Bob Drbul : Jane, I was wondering if you could spend a little more time on new customer acquisition sort of success that you're seeing both domestically and internationally and sort of how you expect that to unfold over the next few quarters? Jane Nielsen : Yes, Bob, and then I'll turn it over to Patrice. We were really happy with the 1.2 million new consumers that we saw engaged with the brand in Q1. As you look backwards, you've seen us be pretty consistent on that trajectory. I think it's really an outcome of, one, the investments we've put in the brand; and two, the investments we've made in our consumer intelligence group and our use of AI and elasticity models to really drive more personalized communication with these new consumers and is really an important part of our AUR and revenue growth turn. We're now, if you think back when we used to promote to drive new consumers, our next great chapter strategy has really been about enticing higher-value consumers into the brand with content and products that they respond to and being available in channels where they want to shop. Patrice Louvet : Yes, Bob, I would add probably three things. First of all, we're seeing this growth of new consumers consistently over time, right, because every quarter, we are talking about 1 million to 1.5 million new consumers. So we've got an engine that's delivering consistently. And it's delivering consistently around the world. This is not just dependent on more emerging market growth. So we're excited about that, both in our core markets like North America, Europe and also Asia. The second point is this is really the outcome of how we've expanded our marketing activity portfolio, which now ranges from powerful experiential fashion moments like the one we're about to do early September, what we just did in along with men's. Two, high-impact celebrity dressing. You saw some of the highlights for the past quarter and we're doing this consistently. Through partnerships with key sports platforms they're really resonating particularly with that younger consumer. Two, now presence in gaming and metaverse related activity that's also helping us engage in a different environment. Two fantastic work by our teams in the markets on social media platforms, right? You heard the numbers earlier today, 53.5 million, new followers on social media across all the different platforms around the world. So this engine that's been put in place that has a diversity of activities that's targeted to different generations, different genders. That's enhancing brand equity is the engine that will consistently drive new customer acquisition. We talk a lot about AUR when it comes to Ralph Lauren, but it's important to remember that our growth algorithm is dependent on three elements. New consumer recruiting, select unit growth and AUR and we feel really good about all three. Operator : Sitting in for Paul Lejuez, we have Tracy Kogan with Citigroup. Tracy Kogan : Two questions. I was hoping you could just detail some of the drivers in the women's business. And what's the growth in the Lauren brand versus the Polo product? And then, secondly, I was hoping you could talk about, I think you said your U.S. wholesale AUR was up 11%. And I was wondering what you expect for wholesale AUR for the year and whether you're getting any pushback from your wholesale partners on price increases you may have taken in the U.S. Patrice Louvet : Sure. So the key success drivers behind our overall women's portfolio are really the three key factors. First of all, we have a product offering that's really resonating with our target consumer. And if you think about what's happening around the world right now and there's a lot of conversations around quiet luxury. What Ralph Lauren has stood for from the time this company was founded 56 years ago, has been quality, has been timeless style, has been confidence in what you're buying, and that's what consumers are looking for today, and particularly what women are looking for today. So the way this is translating from a product category standpoint, is Growth in Linen, growth in suit separates, growth in our dresses business. We're starting to see some early exciting momentum on our handbag business, and this is playing out across both collection, Polo and Lauren. The other element that's actually really supporting, particularly our Polo and our Lauren business is the elevation work that we're doing. It's really moving up in terms of product proposition is moving up in terms of storytelling, is moving up in terms of how we present the product, both online and in-store. I think the consumer is responding really nicely to that. As I mentioned earlier, within our high potential categories are actually our highest performing category is actually our women's business. So we have a proposition that's resonating with consumers around the world. This elevation journey is clearly connecting the product line that we offer is relevant for what consumers are looking for today, and we're very excited about what the future holds for this business. Jane Nielsen : Yes. I would just add, Tracy, that Polo Women's significantly outpaced both our total growth and led our women's growth with up high single digit with Lauren pacing about at company level of growth, a little bit ahead. So we're very encouraged by that. The second part of your question, which is wholesale AUR up 11% this quarter, we still see a strong trajectory for AUR at wholesale. But like in our DTC business, we expect that AUR growth to moderate as the like-for-like pricing moderates as inflation pressures abate. We called out the fall with our peak pressure in terms of cotton costs, we'll start to see those moderate into spring, and you'll see some moderation in our wholesale AUR. I would say the support from our retail partners has been tremendous. This has been a multiyear journey that we've partnered together on. They see the power of elevating the brand. They see the power of the brand, and we're both benefiting from improved consumer desirability that's pulling through into migration of the consumer into higher-end products. So product mix has been a factor in that. And so continued AUR elevation but similar to BGC's moderation. Operator : Our final question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. John Kernan : Jane, how should we think about inventory dollars? It looks like they're sitting around $1.2 billion as of the first quarter. Still you've got some easier compares, I guess, as we go through the rest of the year. Where do you think inventory dollars should land as we head towards the back half of the year? And when do you think we'll start to see some meaningful declines off of what was fairly elevated levels last year. Jane Nielsen : Yes, John, I think that as we called out last year, you'd start to see our inventory levels moderate and align with sales. We've achieved that. Now throughout the year, I think what we plan is that you will see inventory declines as we exit the year as we start to focus on getting weeks on hand in line with pre-COVID levels. And we feel very good, not just about our outlook for declining inventory dollars, but also about the health of our inventories, how we're positioned in core, that really gives us the flexibility to be agile with demand variability. So we feel good about how we're positioned. We think we're in excellent shape relative to some of our industry peers and expect higher inventory trends as we exit the year. Patrice Louvet : Okay. Well, listen, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you in November. And until then, take care. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I will turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Corey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We continue to deliver solid progress on our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan in the second quarter. Through an uncertain global macro environment, our iconic brand and timeless products continue to resonate with consumers all around the world. And our multiple engines of growth across categories and regions, enable our teams to deliver against our strategic and financial commitments even in a choppier backdrop. Second quarter results exceeded our expectations on the top and bottom line. We were particularly encouraged by an acceleration in our retail performance with positive comps across every region and channel in the period. The strength and growing desirability of our brand is underpinned by our continued pricing power, with AUR up another 10% on top of 18% growth last year. In addition, consistent with our plan, we continue to focus on balance sheet and expense discipline. This is fueling our investments in high-impact brand moments spanning geographies and demographics, all while delivering profitability ahead of our expectations. Looking ahead, as the important holiday season gets underway, we are executing on our long-term game plan and keenly focused on what we can control. We are elevating our brands and positioning in the marketplace while staying grounded in the realities of the macro environment. With more than six consecutive years of AUR growth, a cumulative increase of over 70%, we are confident in our pricing power in the market. Now it's important to remember that AUR growth is an output of our overall elevation work that has included evolving our product categories, product mix, and shopping experiences in addition to promotional pullback. This fundamental reset in our pricing architecture gives us the flexibility to continue driving our long-term brand elevation while also reacting with agility to near-term inflationary pressures. Turning to the second quarter. Our performance was guided by our three strategic pillars to drive long-term growth and value creation. These are : first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to invest in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic lifestyle brand. The Ralph Lauren brand resonates across geographies and demographics, powerfully cutting through a wide range of cultural moments, across fashion, music, gaming, sports, and more. Some highlights from the quarter included : first, September marked our return to New York Fashion Week with a rustic romantic show at the Brooklyn Navy Yard where Ralph and our design teams presented a women's show highlighting our brand's quintessential easy elegance and relaxed refinement. Supported by our activations across 25 key markets and influential guests from JLo and Cara Delevingne to Li Bingbing and Sofia Richie Grange, we drove 24 billion impressions globally with outsized growth in our luxury perception ratings in North America. Next, we reinforced our brand leadership in the world of sports with our sponsorship of the U.S. Open, Wimbledon and Ryder Cup. Our brands showed up powerfully on the courts and green and on celebrities and influencers, enjoying sport in our iconic spectator style. We also continue to innovate in the world of gaming to engage new and younger consumers, launching our latest partnership with Fortnite. Race to Greatness immerses players in a unique experience, blending luxury fashion, gaming and exploration. Engagement exceeded our expectations with over 0.5 million unique visitors to the experience and the live stream activation reaching 2 million total views. In China, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of our cult classic Double RL brand with an immersive two-day event with VIP celebrity and influencer attendees featured in a motorcycle tour around Chengdu City, horseback riding, and vintage collection storytelling. Other celebrity highlights from the quarter included dressing Beyonc\u00e9 in her Renaissance World Tour; and Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence both spotted in effortless Polo looks on the streets of New York. Together, these activations are both re-engaging existing customers while also attracting new high-value consumers to our business. We added 1.3 million new consumers to our DTC businesses in the second quarter, consistent with recent trends. And this continues to skew increasingly towards next-generation under 35 consumers. We reached 55.9 million social media followers globally, a low double-digit increase to last year with unique activations across line, TikTok, and our recent launch [indiscernible] driving engagement. And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers globally. Moving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. In uncertain times, consumers continue to turn to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond one season. timeless classics have always been our core proposition. And Ralph and our design teams continue to deliver with an unwavering focus on the quality and quiet luxury that are central to our way of living. Our iconic core products, representing about 70% of our business, grew high single digits in the second quarter, ahead of total company growth, and core penetration to sales increased by roughly 500 basis points, underscoring the importance and resilience of our icons through choppy times. Strong performance in our core was led by our iconic cable knit sweaters in cotton and cashmere, jackets and vests, heritage tie blazer, and unconstructed sports coats. Our kid's business improved sequentially this quarter, led by girls with strength across seasonal fall sweaters, dresses, outerwear, and baby gifts. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's, outerwear, and our emerging home business. Together, these high-potential categories increased low double digits in the quarter. We continue to drive strong growth in women's, our most significant long-term opportunity on an elevated assortment with AUR up mid-teens. Similar to men's, performance was supported by our core icons this fall, including sweaters, garden die shirts, versatile mid- and full-length skirts taking her from day to night, and our iconic blazers and heritage tweed and modern knit fabrications. In the second quarter, we also launched our most comprehensive women's handbag campaign to date with the introduction of our newest icon, the RL 888 With a 360-degree launch across key cities, we are establishing the category in a way that is authentic to our brand with a focus on quality Italian craftsmanship and leathers expressed in Ralph Lauren's elegant aesthetic. Other special releases this quarter included our sports sponsorship collections with U.S. Open and Wimbledon sales significantly outperforming our expectations. Our limited-edition P-Wing Fortnite Sneaker-Boot, which is now reselling to collectors for up to four times the retail price, and in September, together with Rizzoli, we launched a Way of Living, a stunning hardcover book celebrating Ralph Lauren's signature home collections over 40 years. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to create excitement and desirability in addition to driving customer loyalty. On to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world drive elevation and connection through all of our consumer channels and touchpoints. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, which already represent about two-third of company sales. Our strong retail comps this quarter were supported by continued momentum across both core Polo products and luxury collections. In our precision engagement with consumers who have the potential for long-term loyalty and outsized lifetime value. While comps in our Ralph Lauren stores and own digital sites were strong around the world, we were particularly encouraged by improved performance in our outlet business. also positive in every region. Key outlet actions we implemented in the first half of the year from assortment changes to optimize staffing and highly targeted promotions appealing to our more value-oriented consumers, position us well as we head into holiday. In addition to our existing fleet, we opened a select number of iconic Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, including Marina Bay Sand in Singapore, and renovated experiences in Brussels and Stockholm. And in North America, we're excited to build our first ever key city ecosystem in Canada, starting with Toronto, where we opened our first Ralph Lauren store at Yorkdale Center this quarter. And just a few weeks ago, we launched our Canadian digital commerce site, ralphLauren.ca, helping us deliver connected retail experiences to our consumers across the market. Globally, we opened a total of 16 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities this quarter with the majority again in Asia, particularly in China. Our performance in China remains a standout with sales up more than 20% this quarter. This was ahead of our expectations, driven by strong brand momentum and high-quality new consumer recruitment. Looking ahead, we still see significant opportunities to drive our business with global Chinese consumers. And finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. Within our best-in-class digital technology and analytics capabilities, we enhanced our RalphLauren.com digital flagship and app this quarter. This included new search capabilities and improved navigation which helped deliver a more personalized experience and drive conversion. We also continued our early testing of generative AI. For example, leveraging the technology to create select product descriptions on our digital site. As we continue to integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business, we're excited to share that we signed a collective power purchase agreement to scale our purchasing of solar power in Europe. This initiative created by the fashion pack brings us one step closer to reaching our goal to power our direct operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. And just a few weeks ago, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation announced our newest Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at USC's Norris Cancer Center Hospital. This center will represent our third center in the U.S. and our first one on the West Coast. As we continue our efforts to improve access to high-quality cancer screening services and treatment for underserved communities. In closing, Ralph and I are proud of our team's progress creativity, and dedication while navigating a dynamic environment. As we enter the holiday and the second half of the year, we remain focused on what we can control as we deliver on our multiple levers for growth across regions and categories. Our strengthening brand desirability, sustainable pricing power, and consistency of execution continue to differentiate Ralph Lauren through challenging times, and underpinning all of our growth opportunities is the enduring power of our iconic lifestyle brand, which continues to inspire people all over the world to step into their dreams. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We drove second quarter results ahead of our expectations while making strategic growth investments that will continue to support our business in the second half and in the long term. Second quarter revenue growth exceeded our guidance driven by better-than-expected performance in our DTC channels in North America and Europe, along with continued momentum in Asia, led by China. Gross and operating margins were also above our outlook despite ongoing cost headwinds and high levels of strategic investments in the quarter as planned. Our continued brand elevation, favorable channel, and geographic mix shifts, coupled with our focus on cost savings and productivity fueled our investments in sustainable long-term growth. Leveraging our strong cash flow, we delivered approximately $275 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year-to-date. We are on pace with our long-term shareholder return commitments while maintaining our fortress balance sheet one of our key enablers that serves us well through times of uncertainty. With this discipline, we entered the holiday season with clean and healthy inventories. With our elevated brand clear strategy and targeted investments, we are proud of the progress we are making on our multiyear Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan. We remain committed to both our fiscal '24 outlook outlined back in May and our three-year targets, while recognizing that we are still operating in a highly volatile environment. Let me take you through our second quarter financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Total company revenues in the second quarter increased 2% led by double-digit growth in Asia. Revenue in North America and Europe declined slightly to last year, with Europe impacted by timing shifts as noted on our last call. Total company comp increased 6%, with all three regions delivering positive comp growth in the period, led by our Ralph Lauren stores and digital Notably, our outlet comps improved with both stronger traffic and stabilizing conversion trends. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 65.4%. This was better than our outlook as strong AUR growth, lower freight expenses, and favorable channel and geographic mix more than offset ongoing pressure from higher cotton costs. We continue to expect stronger gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as cotton headwinds start to moderate and inventories remain clean and well-positioned. AUR increased 10% on top of 18% growth last year with balanced growth across all regions and channels, driven by our long-term strategy of brand and product elevation. This more than offset targeted promotional activity in the quarter focused on driving conversion with our value-sensitive consumers. Adjusted operating expense increased 10% to 55.5% of sales, driven by this year's cadence of higher marketing, talent to support our strategic growth areas, and long-term investments in our key city ecosystems, notably in-store customer service, new digital site launches and search engine upgrades. Marketing was 8% of sales compared to 7% last year. We continue to expect full-year marketing at around 7% of sales, consistent with our long-term guidance, including a more normalized growth in the second half. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Second quarter revenue declined 1% ahead of our expectations with stronger growth in our retail business offset by expected wholesale declines in a softer environment for the channel. In North America Retail, second quarter comps increased 4%, representing a meaningful improvement over our first quarter trends. Comps were positive in every channel, including outlet, which started to benefit from our recent interventions to strengthen the customer experience and selective promotions to drive conversion with value-oriented consumers. Comps in our owned RalphLauren.com site grew 4%, a 12-point improvement from Q1 and as we continue to drive personalization and targeted marketing activations. All DTC channels delivered at least mid-single-digit AUR growth alongside these comp improvements. In North America Wholesale, revenues declined 7% to last year, in line with our expectations as we carefully manage sell-in to the channel to align with softer consumer demand. While this channel is also experiencing some challenges related to macro inflation pressures, we are encouraged that our top 100 doors are significantly outperforming the rest of the fleet, following our targeted investments in renovations and service levels. In addition, our wholesale AUR continued to grow, up mid-single digits on product mix elevation and controlled inventory levels. Looking ahead, we are maintaining a cautious outlook on the channel and remain focused on aligning inventory levels to demand. Moving on to Europe. Revenue declined slightly in the second quarter, ahead of our expectations. Results included five points of negative impact from the earlier timing of fall '23 wholesale deliveries into the prior quarter and lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances. Retail comps increased 6% with owned digital commerce up 14% and brick-and-mortar comps up 5% on similar performance in Ralph Lauren and outlet stores. Europe AUR increased high single digits in the quarter. Digital comps were higher than our expected full-year run rate as new sites accelerated growth. Similar to North America, we added targeted incremental seasonal promotions to drive conversion, which meaningfully benefited Q2. We Conversely, we expect Q3 digital comps to be negatively impacted by a calendar shift in Boxing Day sales to Q4. We Europe wholesale declined 7% to last year, in line with expectations, including approximately nine points of headwinds from the items noted previously. Looking ahead, these drivers are expected to negatively impact our Q3 and Q4 growth by about 12 point and four points, respectively. Turning to Asia. Revenues increased 13%, with growth led again by China. China sales increased more than 20% on top of a strong compare of more than 30% last year on continued brand momentum. Second quarter sales in Japan were up low double digits. We expect continued momentum in Asia in the second half of the year, with growth in China outpacing the rest of the region. Within our other nonreportable segments, licensing revenue declined high single digits, in line with our plan. The transition out of our Lauren men's suiting license as a part of our long-term elevation journey drove the entire decline and will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of fiscal '24. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows are key enablers of our Fortress foundation and allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times. We ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventories declined 5%, aligned with our expectations and below our revenue growth trend with units down high teens. Inventories decreased double digit in North America, on a more normalized timing of receipts and cautious top-line outlook for the region. Inventories in Europe also declined in constant currency, while Asia levels reflected our strong expected growth rates. We still expect to end fiscal '24 with inventory below prior-year levels. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures, and other consumer spending-related headwinds, and foreign currency volatility, among others. For fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, centering on a range of 1% to 2%. Our outlook embeds slightly increased caution around the wholesale channel, where year-to-date demand has been soft. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact reported revenues by about 50 basis points due to unfavorable shifts in both Asian and European exchange rates versus our prior outlook. We continue to expect top-line growth to be led by Asia, followed by low single-digit growth in Europe. And we still expect a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends in the first half and wholesale timing shifts in Q1. We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 basis points to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is expected to have roughly 10 basis points negative impact on full-year operating margin. We expect gross margin expansion in the range of 120 basis points to 170 basis points in constant currency, up from about 100 basis points previously. This is driven by more favorable freight costs, mix shifts towards international and DTC and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting full-year cotton inflation. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset higher operating expenses as we invest in key strategic initiatives, particularly around digital, Key City ecosystem expansion, marketing, and sustainability. Relative to our Investor Day base period, guidance still implies about 80 basis points to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant on track with our long-term targets. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to increase 1% to 2% in constant currency, led again by Asia. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 30 basis points. We remain cautious on North America and expect similar trends to Q2 with softness in wholesale offsetting stronger trends in DTC. In Europe, third quarter sales are still expected to be negatively impacted by the timing of earlier fall shipments and from lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances. Excluding these unusual impacts, we expect underlying trends in Europe to be more in line with our full-year outlook for the region of low single-digit growth. We expect third quarter operating margin to be roughly flat in constant currency with about 10 basis points of foreign currency benefit. We expect constant currency gross margin expansion of 100 basis points to 150 basis points, largely offset by a higher proportion of marketing and ecosystem investments planned in the second quarter and third quarter of the fiscal year. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the full-year and roughly 23% to 24% for the third quarter and capital expenditures are expected to be around $250 million. In closing, our year-to-date performance demonstrates the agility of our teams to deliver continued strong execution, along with progress on our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan, led by Ralph's enduring vision our teams around the world are consistently driving brand desirability with products and experiences that resonate across generations, geographies, and lifestyles. Even as we navigate near-term challenges, our multiple engines of growth, along with our Fortress foundation, put us in a position of strength to continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Michael Binetti : Maybe two quick ones here. Patrice, you guys maintained the outlook for the year, you referred to, obviously, the macro uncertainty in the prepared remarks. What do you think about as the factors in your control that enabled you to maintain the back half commitments and beyond, especially if the environment deteriorates further from here? And then I guess, maybe a jump all for both of you, but how do we think a little bit beyond this year on the wholesale side, particularly in North America, you made some comments on your thoughts on the channel now. Do you feel like the channel is under-inventoried at this point? And how do you think about the opportunity to fill in wholesale next year as we look a little bit beyond the calendar year? Patrice Louvet : All right. Well, Michael, welcome back. Thanks for your question. Our teams continue to execute really well in a tough environment. And while we're planning for things to remain choppy for the foreseeable future, I think this quarter showed once again that we can deliver on our commitments. There are a few reasons for that, and I just want to call out the top three. First one is our brand is our most powerful asset, and we're driving momentum and desirability. As we cut through culture and appeal across generations through a variety of platforms, I actually think we have probably one of the most diversified broadest marketing programs in our space, ranging from the fashion show we did recently at New York Fashion Week, to two sports partnerships, Wimbledon and Ryder Cup U.S. Open just this last quarter through dressing celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9, you heard that in the prepared remarks to actually influencers wearing us spontaneously to gaming with Fortnite. So, a broad range of activities. We continue to invest in our brands for the long term, and we're seeing consumers respond to that. The second point, which is actually quite important during challenging periods like this for consumers is our iconic core products anchor us think beautifully made casual wear sweaters, maybe blazers, tweet jackets, Oxford shirts, really the foundations of a wardrobe. And these timeless products deliver through cycles and when things get more challenging, we know consumers tend to gravitate back to core products, products, and brands they know and trust. And in addition to that, we continue to have significant growth opportunities in women's and in outerwear. And then the third point, and you heard this in our prepared remarks, is our DTC channels are really where we can best control the consumer experience -- these channels today represent two-thirds of our business. So, DTC is two-thirds of our flooring business, different picture than a few years ago. And as you saw, actually, our performance in that channel is accelerating with positive comps across every channel, brick-and-mortar and digital across every region. So, in addition to this, I think we've also built over the past few years an agility muscle that's integrated into our operating model. And I think you saw this in this past quarter. For example, we made fast product assortment changes, leaning even further into our core products in order to improve traffic and conversion in DTC, and you saw that play out in the numbers. We delivered enhanced staffing in our retail stores to improve the customer experience. And online, we also made a number of changes relative to surge and more personalized pages, which also drove to an acceleration, both from a traffic conversion and AVT standpoint in those important channels. And while we continue to elevate our brand, this wouldn't be a Ralph Lauren call if I didn't talk about AUR. You see this play out in increased AUR again this quarter, up 10% in an environment that's relatively intense from a promotional standpoint. And we are able to grow AUR double digits while having limited targeted promotional actions for our more value-oriented consumers to close the deal and drive conversion. So, listen, we're operating in a very uncertain world, but I think that's become the norm. We know how to navigate this, and our iconic brand, our multiple growth drivers, and our agility muscle really help us to stay on offense. And importantly, we have the operational discipline and the balance sheet to enable continued investment in growth. So, I think when you look across the marketplace, these are all very important differentiators and we're going to continue to focus on what we can control to win and create value in the marketplace. When it comes to wholesale since it's a jump bulging at the ball. Over to you. Jane Nielsen : Even though I can't jump very high. Let me just frame the thinking that we have on wholesale longer term and to date. Wholesale is an important environment for us, for consumer discovery. We know from our consumer work that when a consumer buys and experiences Ralph Lauren quality, we can hook them. And so, it's an important and profitable channel for that important consumer discovery. Just from what we've done for many years, our focus on managing matching sell-in to demand and tight inventory management is something that we're doing today. Our inventories are well controlled and something that as we think about the future is something that we have to continue to lean into, along with leveraging our core, which resonates well with that consumer being able to chase into variable demand allows us to meet those consumer needs, and I think will serve us well into the long term, working with our partners to personalize our marketing with loyal consumers that we have across the channels. And then importantly, all wholesale is not created equal. There's a bifurcation between top-tier wholesale, where we're growing, and doors across the markets. Top city, top doors are performing meaningfully better the balance of fleet. And that's where we can do some interventions that Patrice described that are working in DTC, like investing capital and renovating, make sure we have great environments, investing with our partners in greater service levels. We know that, that works, those doors are performing better and is a place where we can concentrate resources and give an ROI. So, I think we have a good operating game plan and strategic game plan for wholesale. Where -- we saw pullback in about two-thirds of our doors, we evaluate every day, where should we be and looking at that on a door-by-door basis and we'll continue to do that into the future. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Bob Drbul : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Patrice. I guess, Jane, can I follow up on the balance sheet? The balance sheet is very strong. We've heard some of your peers update their capital allocation strategies. And what Patrice just referred to as early uncertain environment, how are you planning to manage the balance sheet capital allocation going forward? Are you doing anything differently? And also, can you just elaborate a bit more in terms of I don't know, country trends or really what you're seeing throughout Europe with the outlook that you've given us again? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thanks for the question. The current operating environment is volatile. But our performance through it makes us even more committed to our strong balance sheet and culture of operating discipline, all of the things that are really critical to our Fortress Foundation with the agility of our team, it's what really enables us to continue to drive the plans through tougher times. And we think that our focused foundation and the way we manage our balance and our commitment to capital allocation is increasingly a strong differentiator for us -- and we're always interesting and interested in doubling down on just differentiation. So, I think the short answer is we're going to continue on passionate about discipline in managing our balance sheet and sticking with our capital allocation principles, which drives growth and investments and return capital to shareholders. And it's not just words and principles, it's producing results for our shareholders. We're on track with our capital allocation and shareholder return commitments that you heard us talk about at Investor Day. At the halfway mark, we returned about $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Our cash position remains extremely strong. We're in a net cash position, and our leverage is nearing our historical levels and those levels are usually low with our targeted one-time to two times EBITDA leverage. And our inventories are clean. Our inventories are down 5% this quarter with units down double digit. And importantly, North America inventory was down double digits and Europe in constant currency was down mid-single digits. Again, we expect to end the year tight inventory discipline that inventory will be down as we exit the year, improving our overall terms. So, we're more committed than ever Just on the country trends that we're seeing across Europe. Patrice Louvet : I'll jump on that training balls. So, Bob, I think there are a few observations that apply to all the regions, and then I'll give you specifics for each individual one. So, the observations applied to all the regions is environment is choppy, but our core consumer remains resilient, right? And we're seeing actually a nice growth with our core consumer a higher value, less price-sensitive consumer, and that's true across all three regions. We're also seeing really good performance this quarter. I think it's one of the highlights of the quarter in our DTC channels across all the regions. So, every channel, every region, positive comp growth, brick-and-mortar and digital. Third area is we are continuing to recruit new consumers, and we're continuing to recruit new consumers in Asia, in North America, and in Europe, higher value, less price-sensitive younger consumers. And our general internal metrics of traffic and ADT and AUR are consistently up across all three regions. So those are common elements. We have seen improvement in our outlets with our, particularly our more value-sensitive consumers. The interventions that Jane and I have been talking about have been impactful during the past quarter. So, we're quite encouraged by the strengthening that we've seen in our outlet channel and our ability to really connect with that smaller consumer group, but still they are a value-oriented consumer. Now if I look at things by region. So North America, our biggest region, down 1%. Again, DTC growing right, comps up 4% in DTC and North America, growing across all the channels. The pressure Jane mentioned, it is more in wholesale. And here, we have differentiation between high-end wholesale, as you highlighted, Jane, the markets of this world where we are growing the top doors of our largest partners where we are also basically flattish, and then the doors that are more challenged are kind of think to 100 and beyond. And we have an action plan to go strengthen that, that you heard from Jim. In Europe, on the face of it, we're down 1%, actually, if you do like-for-like, we're actually up, I think, 3%. If you take to remove the timing shifts from a wholesale standpoint. Likewise, here, we're seeing strong performance in DTC across all the channels and wholesale continues to be challenged, again, on the space of it. But if you take the timing shifts out, actually wholesale grew in Q2 in Europe. And we're seeing a really nice rebound with one of our largest partners in Europe. So that's quite encouraging for the future. In Asia, we're up 13% on a constant currency basis, nice diversified growth across our key markets, China being the fastest-growing region for us there, up 20%, both Mainland and HMT. So, we're feeling really good about the continuing momentum we have in that region. The brand is resonating. The product offering is connecting nicely, and the teams are doing an excellent job executing our key city ecosystem approach in our top six cities Japan delivered a nice quarter with double-digit growth, and Japan is not yet benefiting from the return of group tourism from China. So, there's more growth to come down the road in that part of the region. And then we've seen solid growth across Southeast Asia and the balance of the region. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a sense of commonalities, a lot of common elements across the different regions and then what's unique to each individual one... Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matt Boss : Great. Thanks. Patrice, so maybe could you elaborate on the structural building blocks that you've put in place, which you think drove the material acceleration at direct-to-consumer here today? And then how you see the brand position in the holiday to potentially continue to take share? And then, Jane, could you just outline the drivers of the raised gross margin outlook for this year? And if there's any change to mid-teens operating margins as the target as we think to next year? Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Matt. So, our game plan continues to be driven by our overall goal, which is and strategy, which is brand elevation across our three pillars : brand building, driving the core, and expanding to more from a product standpoint, and expanding our TCD ecosystem. What we have seen in terms of short-term interventions that have really resonated well in DTC have been the work that we've done on products leaning harder into core because during these challenging times, as I mentioned earlier, consumers are gravitating towards core products. And for us, those are our more elevated products, so less seasonal items, less tees shorts and fleece and what are truly iconic Ralph Lauren products, jackets, Oxford shirts, heat separate, cable mix sweaters. That's on product. When it comes to digital, part of the improvement has been also driven by an enhanced search capability that we've implemented as well as different brand presentations for our ADT product description pages, which are driving both traffic, ADT and conversion -- for our outlets in particular, we relooked at our staffing model to make sure that we're providing the consumer with a great experience every single day and hour of the week. And that shift has actually translated into stronger traffic, stronger ADT, stronger AUR across the channel. And then I referred to our broad marketing program earlier, and I think the team is doing a really nice job making sure that each individual element is connecting with that target customer and we're seeing the benefits of that. And then finally, I would add, as Jane and I mentioned earlier, that for those more value-oriented consumers, we have done in a very limited and very targeted way promotional activity that has helped close the sale with them. And what we're pleased about is this inherent agility that we built into our model over time, enables us to continue to grow AUR six year in a row and have the flexibility to be pointed on promotional activity where needed most relevant in those more value-oriented channels. In terms of how we're set up for holiday, I think we're actually well positioned. We've got a game plan that's clear. We're executing the strategy that we have had in place for some time now. We are seeing consumers respond nicely to both our marketing and our product offering. And while we're keeping an eye on the volatility of the situation. We feel good about the momentum we have going into the holiday period. You saw the vast number of marketing activities we had in Q2, that gives us momentum going into the holiday season. The pivot on product that we've been able to make positions us really nicely in terms of showcasing our core strength, which is our iconic propositions. And each channel, each region has the flexibility and the agility to respond to what we see in the market. So, while we recognize the environment continues to be choppy and will likely be for the foreseeable future, I think we're well positioned coming into holiday. Jane Nielsen : Just on gross margin, Matt, we're really pleased to raise our outlook to 120 basis points to 170 basis points of gross margin expansion in constant currency for this year. There are really three primary drivers. Freight, we are seeing upside in freight, notably in ground transportation that's more than offsetting cotton headwinds now. So, more opportunity in freight -- we are also seeing upside in AUR. We put up a double-digit AUR growth this quarter while growing gross margin and reigniting DTC. So, we believe that for Q3 and Q4, we have upside to our AUR and channel mix. The acceleration in DTC that Patrice called out in Q2, we'd expect that performance to continue for the balance of the year. We still have a cost headwind in cotton. But again, I think we've more than fully offset that. And we're seeing some of our productivity initiatives flow through, as we said, a little more balanced in COGS than in SG&A, but we are realizing those productivity initiatives, and that's gross margin as well. So very encouraged by that. And as we look at the progress we've made this year, there's no change in our Investor Day guidance to mid-teens constant currency OI growth. We remain firmly committed to that goal and firmly committed to our outlook in FY '24, while recognizing that we're operating in a highly volatile environment. We know what we need to do we need to continue our top-line growth. We need to continue to drive our cost productivities. And we need the investments that we're making and the investments that we're making, we know will pay off not only in the second half but into FY '25. So, we're happy to remain committed, and to our Investor Day guidance of mid-teens. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Patel with Raymond James. Rick Patel : Thank you, good morning, and congrats on strong execution in a tough macro. I was hoping you could help us understand the higher comps in the outlet channel impressive results given the pressure on the consumer there. Can you talk about the changes that you implemented that drove that result and how we should think about the sustainability of that growth going forward? Patrice Louvet : Sure. It's really the execution of the different strategic pillars that we have in place. So first, I think as we talked earlier, be leaning into our core products and we see consumer -- strong consumer response, both on our men's business, very strong response on our women's business, strong improvement on our kids\u2019 business. So, leading into core products, it's been intervention one, Rick, that's going to keep going, right? Intervention number two has been customer experience and making sure that we're servicing the customer in the right way, consistently throughout the week.  And we know we have some opportunities to rebalance staffing and strengthen staffing in some areas to make sure that the customer walking through the door was getting the type of experience that they deserve from Ralph Lauren. Point number three is marketing activities and targeted marketing activities for that shopper for that consumer, leveraging both the centers, capabilities, and platforms and our own database. And then point number four, relates specifically to connected retail and how we leverage our connected retail capabilities. Now I don't know if you've been in some of our outlets recently, but we've implemented endless aisle screens, for example, where now you can shop the entire catalog from that store, full price outlet, anything that's available within the Ralph Lauren catalog, we also have digital clienteling for outlet customers, which has also been useful and driven the performance this past quarter and are structural. So, will continue to pay benefits moving forward. And then finally, as I highlighted earlier, for those more value-oriented consumers who need that little support to close the deal we have been able to implement limited targeted promotional activity further more value-oriented consumers while still being able to expand the AUR in that channel. So, five core interventions. I'm really proud of how nimble the organization has been as we've read consumer behavior, competitive environment. And we feel good that these interventions will serve as well through holiday and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Hi, good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the nice improvement. One of the things I noticed is when you talked about your core product and the improvement that you saw just in the core product, I think it was up high single digits compared to the first quarter up mid-single digits. In addition to the continuing strength of the women's outerwear and home business is up low double digits. In the core business, anything new on pricing, newness and product that you're seeing there that could continue as we move forward.  And then on the AUR growth of 10%, how are you thinking of the magnitude of AUR growth for the balance of the year? And with new introductions like the RL 888, is that helping to drive AUR growth? And are you seeing anything different by region? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Dana. So, in terms of evolutions in our core products and products in general, what we're seeing is the consumer really gravitating towards this sophisticated casual, more elevated style. Right. And that's been consistent. We're seeing that both across men's and women. That really plays nicely to what Ralph and the teams have built over time, which is this notion of quality, luxury, authenticity, that's pretty -- I think, pretty unique to Ralph Lauren, and these are the categories that I highlighted earlier. So, our cash near cable mid-waters our tweet jackets, our garment dye Oxford shirts as illustration of that. We're going to continue to drive that. I think -- that's what consumers are looking for right now as they are more total in where they invest. They want to invest in pieces that are timeless, but they can wear beyond one specific season. So, we feel that's one intervention. Second intervention, which you will likely have seen, Dana, because you're quite close to all this, is the elevation that we're doing on Polo with the expansion of silver label. We had a beautiful campaign recently filmed in Goodwood, the Goodwood Festival that kind of highlights these beautiful new products so leather outerwear, suits, beautiful sweaters. And you're going to see us continue to lean into that because we're seeing strong consumer response within that. And then on the women's side, you highlighted it. We've been really pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing on women's, both on Polo, on collection, and on Laurence. So, across our women's portfolio. And again, these are iconic Ralph Lauren styles that you know well and that are really resonating with consumers right now? Jane Nielsen : Just on the near-term trajectory of AUR, as you mentioned, up 10% this quarter, we do expect there to be -- that we are past the peak of product cost pressures. So, the pressure to price with inflation a bit slightly in the balance of the year. But I think we're planning on AUR being in the high single-digit range as we close out the year. So again, strong AUR growth, what we're seeing is that consumers are penetrating into our higher-priced products. So, we're seeing a penetration increase into products over $100. We're also seeing our new consumers penetrate the new consumers that we're recruiting penetrate into higher AUR products, so higher individual products and higher basket. That's really given us the flexibility to do what Patrice talked about, which is reach a more value-oriented consumer with some highly targeted discounts, leveraging our one-to-one marketing personalization so that we can reach them directly. I don't expect to change in our AUR journey in the near term. And as you'll recall, AUR is really for us is about many levers. It's founded in the brand elevation journey that we're continuing -- and you'll see us continue our product mix elevation, which is going to where the consumers -- where consumer demand is going, but also building that agility and flexibility for us to continue to expand gross margins we took up our guidance and continue to drive strong DTC growth. Patrice Louvet : Dana, the way we talk about it a lot with our marketing teams is the following model : trade-in trade up, trade across, right? And those are the three kind of levers for us to drive growth. And given the breadth of our product offering and our lifestyle proposition, we have significant trade-up opportunities. So maybe sell less T-shirts, but more tweet jackets, more RL 888 bags, more outerwear, more So trade-up is a significant growth opportunity, which will serve us for years, if not decades. Trade across same thing. We bring you -- we trade you in and then there are so many different categories we can trade you across. So, I think these levers of growth kind of, again, roll back up to the diversification of growth drivers that this company now has.  All right. It is time to close. So, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to sharing our third quarter results with you in February. Have a great day.

This holiday quarter, our campaigns around the world celebrated a season of giving, marked by warm, reflection and comfort that inspires people to dream of the best things in life and share them with those they love. Immersing people in our world of easy elegance and sophistication has epitomized Ralph Lauren over 57 years. And we continue to deliver this quarter-after-quarter to an ever-expanding audience to our next great chapter accelerate plan. This combination of magic and logic translated to strong financial performance in the third quarter, our biggest quarter of the year. With top and bottom line results that exceeded our expectations, along with significant EPS growth. As we continue to navigate a dynamic global operating environment, our teams remain keenly focused on what we can control. This starts with our timeless and highly desirable brand which is resonating with consumers all around the world and enabling continued pricing power in the market. Our ability to leverage a broad powerful portfolio of core products that we can flex with evolving consumer needs. Our continued deliberate shift toward our direct-to-consumer channels where we can best deliver our elevated and connected consumer experiences and which once again led growth in the quarter. And all of this is underpinned by the agility and operational discipline we have built into our business so that we can continue fueling our strategic growth initiatives for the long-term. As we outlined at our last Investor Day, we are strongly encouraged that we have built a sustainable and resilient model with multiple diversified drivers for long-term growth and value creation. Our third quarter performance was a clear example of how we're driving progress across our three strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include, first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand, second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights across each of these areas. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to harness the power of our iconic brand as we expand across geographies and demographics, cutting through culture across fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming and music moments. During the third quarter, key campaigns included, first, our holiday season for dreaming activations in every region generating nearly 8 billion global impressions. These included immersive holiday gifting content, unique key city takeovers across New York, Shanghai, London and Berlin and our Singles Day stream in China. Second, our Polo Ralph Lauren Artist and Residence campaign featuring Navajo Designer, Naiomi Glasses, which is the first in a series of groundbreaking partnerships focused on empowering and celebrating artisans within the communities that have historically inspired our designs. This campaign was not just a galvanizing cultural moment for our organization, but also resonated strongly with consumers, driving more than 3 billion impressions and our highest engagements ever on TikTok. We also outfitted an incredible roster of inspiring women including America Ferreira, Jody Foster, Greta Lee and JLo at the L Women in Hollywood event. Janelle Monae and Kate Bock at Art Basel in Miami. And Gauravi Kumari, Princess of Jaipur for a high-profile fundraiser at the dazzling City Palace in Jaipur, India. And who could forget Taylor Swift, who chose an all-American Ralph Lauren look for the cover of Time Magazine as their 2023 Person of the Year. These activations helped to fuel our strongest quarter of new consumer acquisition and brand affinity since the pandemic. We added 1.7 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, up high single digits to last year, driven by all regions. Our Net Promoter Scores accelerated along with positive momentum in brand consideration and purchase intent. And we grew our followers on social media by low double digits to last year, led by TikTok, Instagram, WeChat and Douyin. Moving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Consumers continue to turn to brands they know and trust and styles that live on beyond one season. And this holiday was no exception. As Ralph and our design teams seamlessly married sophisticated casual with styles exuding the luxury and glamor of the season. Our iconic core products, representing about 70% of our business, grew low double digits in the quarter, ahead of total company growth. From our Mesh Polos and Oxford Shirts, to our luxuriously soft Cashmere Sweaters and versatile Blazers, we have established a broad and highly recognizable portfolio of icons that drive our business through both choppy and more stable times alike. And we are incredibly proud of the work Ralph and our creative teams are doing to drive newness and excitement behind these styles, so they appeal to our most loyal and new consumers alike. Performance in core was led by our cable knit sweaters in cotton woolen cashmere, quilted and down jackets and sports coats in the range of tweed, tartan plaid, stretch corduroy and party ready velvets. As we continue to build on the long-term foundation of our core, we also delivered strong growth in our high potential categories, including women's, outerwear and home. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits to last year. This was led again by women's, our most significant long-term growth opportunity. Driven by an elevated assortment with AUR up mid-teens. Performance was supported by our cashmere, flag and polo bear sweaters, sophisticated wool and cashmere coats, blazers and heritage tweed and modern knit tools and cocktail and evening dresses. Other special releases this quarter included our Polo Country and Element Skateboards Capsule, a limited-edition collection of unisex Polo Country styles and Element Skateboards celebrating the great outdoors. We sold over 2,000 skateboards, highlighting the lifestyle reach of our brand, and appeal to younger consumers. Our limited edition Polo ID handbag collaboration with Mr. Bags in China, which sold out within one minute on WeChat. Our innovative love of the land collaboration with Navajo Designer, Naomi Glasses; Ralph Lauren's first artist in residents. And the annual and much-loved Ralph Lauren Pink Pony collection supporting Ralph's 30-year commitment to cancer care and research. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive our core icons while leveraging the breadth of our brand and assortments to fuel excitement, and desirability. Turning to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world drive elevation and deliver consistency through all of our consumer channels and touch points. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites, which combined already represent about 2/3 of company sales. During the quarter, we drove accelerated comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets. Globally, we opened a total of 17 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities with the majority again in Asia. While comps in our Ralph Lauren stores and own digital sites were strong around the world, we were particularly encouraged by the continued improvement in our outlet trends. The key outlet actions we implemented in the first half of the year from our optimized staffing to assortment enhancements and emphasis on quality and value, served us well through holiday and will continue to be drivers as we look ahead. In addition to our existing fleet, we opened a select number of iconic Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, including our new emblematic store at Singapore's Marina Bay Sands, the first door to offer our luxury collections in Southeast Asia. Our first Ralph Lauren store in the Czech Republic, in Prague's historic old town as well as in Charlotte, North Carolina. And our first Ralph's coffee shops in Paris and the UAE. We also launched our Ralph Lauren digital flagship site in Canada, following our Toronto store opening last quarter. Combined with our elevated wholesale presence, these are helping us introduce a cohesive connected retail experience to our consumers across the Canadian market. By region, growth was again led by Asia with particularly strong performance in China, where sales increased more than 30% this quarter on both comp and new store growth. This was ahead of our expectations, even with last year's easier compares due to the surge in COVID cases. We are still in the earlier stages of brand building in China with meaningful outperformance versus peers in the quarter on consumer KPIs, including brand awareness, consideration and Net Promoter Scores. Our team delivered another successful Singles Day focused on brand building with ralphlauren.cn sales up 25% on lower discounting and higher AURs to last year. Our early performance to date on Douyin has also been very encouraging following our limited launch last fall with an expanded rollout this spring. And finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. As we drive towards best-in-class digital technology and analytics, we tested our sophisticated predictive buying model in our European and Asian stores this quarter. With our initial rollout limited to select sweaters, knit tops and caps, this artificial intelligence-driven model enables better in-stock availability on sizing and best-selling products to drive incremental sales and improved conversion. Based on this early success, we plan to continue scaling its use to an expanded range of categories and markets over time. As we continue to integrate citizenship and sustainability to future-proof our business, we are also proud to be named once again one of Forbes World's Best Employers in 2023. In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's excellent execution through this important holiday season. This quarter's performance reinforces how the power of our iconic brand, together with our multi-lever strategy delivers. We are firing on multiple cylinders while not dependent on a single geography channel or category for growth. And this model, combined with our unique agility and the remarkable dedication of our teams is what will continue to differentiate Ralph Lauren through these dynamic times. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We entered this holiday season with a clear game plan. We invested in brand momentum around the world, expanded giftable core and seasonal products to delight our consumers and drove key operational improvements and flexibility to mitigate near-term macro headwinds. This quarter's strong performance was a testament to the agility of our teams and the resilience of our next great chapter accelerate plan, coupled with the power and global reach of our iconic brand. We reported third quarter revenue, adjusted operating profit and double-digit EPS growth above our outlook. And we achieved this while continuing to strengthen our brand proposition around the world and investing in our key strategic priorities to enable sustainable growth into the future. Top line exceeded our guidance, driven by comp acceleration in DTC with momentum in all retail channels globally. Operating margin expansion was also ahead of our outlook despite our strategic investments and ongoing cotton headwinds as we focus on operating with discipline in an evolving global environment. And we returned approximately $425 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year-to-date, in line with our long-term guidance. Let me take you through our third quarter financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Our accelerating brand momentum and investments in key holiday campaigns resulted in 5% total revenue growth. This was above our outlook led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and holiday outperformance in Europe. Revenue in North America was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations. Each of our DTC channels contributed to top line growth in the period, with total DTC penetration expanding approximately 400 basis points to last year, adding stability and resiliency to our business, consistent with our NGC strategy. Total company comp increased 9%, accelerating sequentially across all three regions. Ralph Lauren stores continued to lead our global performance. Our positive outlet comps continued to improve following investments in service and expanded core product assortments, driving solid traffic, AUR, and basket size growth in every region. Comps in our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites increased 8% on top of 11% growth last year as we prioritize ongoing investments to expand our footprint and improve the customer experience online. Total digital ecosystem sales were also up high single digits, including a strong recovery in Europe as our largest pure-play account returned to growth. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 66.5%, reflecting our long-term elevation work. This was consistent with our outlook, driven by lower freight expense, favorable channel and geographic mix and 9% AUR growth. These more than offset ongoing cotton cost headwinds and targeted promotions to drive conversion during key holiday sale periods. Cotton costs will start to abate at the end of our Q4, beginning with our spring 24 collections. As previously indicated, we are planning a moderation in AUR growth based on a reduced need to pass like-for-like cost inflation onto the consumer. Nevertheless, we plan to continue driving positive AUR increases as a result of our growing brand desirability, ongoing product mix elevation and favorable geographic and channel mix. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% to 50.2% of sales a 100-basis point increase to last year. The increase as a percent of sales was driven largely by channel and geographic mix shifts in the quarter. With our DTC and international businesses contributing a significantly higher share of sales in the period versus last year. This quarter's strategic investments focused on our key city ecosystems, marketing investments and enhancing the consumer experience and service levels across our DTC channels. Variable selling expenses also rose as a result of stronger retail sales growth. Marketing was 7.5% of sales, up slightly from last year to support our high-impact holiday activations, delivering improvement across our consumer metrics, including brand consideration, Net Promoter Scores and purchase intent. We still expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Third quarter revenue was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations as stronger growth in retail was offset by our reduced sell-in to the wholesale channel. In North America Retail, third quarter comps increased 5%, led by a double-digit increase in our Ralph Lauren stores. Our outlet performance continued to improve with positive comps driven by our product elevation and our recent interventions to improve the selling experience and retail environments. Despite taking targeted promotions during the key holiday periods, our outlet AUR increased strongly and discount rates declined versus last year. Comps in our owned ralphlauren.com site were up 4% on top of 9% growth last year. In addition to a strong response to our Black Friday event, recent site enhancements such as upgraded search and navigation drove higher conversion in the quarter. We also launched our Canadian digital site in the quarter. In North America wholesale, revenues decreased 15%, in line with our expectations as we proactively focus on aligning inventory with softer demand trends. We continue to evaluate our brand presence in each store and exited approximately 20 department store doors this year. While we plan to manage this channel carefully into calendar '24, we were encouraged by our improving sellout trends, which meaningfully outperformed our sell-in this quarter. Our AUR in the channel was also up on a year-over-year basis. Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 6%, with performance led by our DTC channels. This was above our expectations as strong growth across the continent more than offset continued consumer and macro headwinds in the U.K., results included roughly 5 points of negative impact from the earlier timing of wholesale deliveries and lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances. Retail comps increased 11% on top of a strong 11% compare last year with similar performance in our brick-and-mortar and digital sites. We drove strong momentum across brands and categories in Europe, with growth led by gifting, seasonal sweaters and outerwear, which are AUR accretive. Europe wholesale was approximately flat to last year, but included about 11 points of net headwinds from unusual impacts of wholesale allowances and earlier receipts. Strong underlying growth was supported by wholesale reorders, which returned to more normalized trends in the quarter, following recent destocking at digital wholesale accounts. While our Europe business has performed better than expected through the first three quarters of the year we remain cautious on the fourth quarter and into fiscal '25, given highly dynamic geopolitical and macro conditions in the region. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 17%, with double-digit growth across our largest markets of Japan, China and Korea. Asia retail comps were up 14% with strong growth in both digital commerce and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased more than 30% on continued brand momentum, including successful Singles Day events as we lapped last year's COVID impact. Third quarter sales in Japan were up low double digits. Overall inbound tourism recovered to pre-pandemic levels, although Chinese travelers to Japan are still down 70%. Sales in Korea also rebounded to low double-digit growth, benefiting from our recent marketing activations and a shift in the timing of the Chuseok holiday from Q2 last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows are key enablers of our Fortress foundation and allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory decreased 15%, below our revenue growth trend with units also down double digits. The decline was driven by stronger-than-expected Q3 sales and our continued efforts to ensure healthy wholesale inventories. As we transition into spring, we believe overall inventory levels are well positioned relative to our outlook for each region. We still expect to end fiscal '24 with healthy inventories below prior year levels with an improved ability to chase into potential demand as a result of our predictive buying model. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds, potential supply chain disruption and foreign currency volatility among others. For fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, now centering on about 2% compared to our previous outlook of 1% to 2%. Our outlook continues to embed caution around the wholesale channel where year-to-date demand has been softer than prior year. Foreign currency is now expected to benefit revenue growth by about 10 basis points. We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have a roughly neutral impact on full year operating margin. We now expect gross margin expansion in the range of 140 to 180 basis points in constant currency, up slightly from 120 to 170 basis points previously. This is driven by favorable freight costs, further mix shift toward international and DTC and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting full year cotton inflation. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset expense deleverage due to mix shift and key strategic investments. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to increase in a range centered around 2% in constant currency, with stronger trends in retail versus continued caution in wholesale in both North America and Europe. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 160 basis points. While we remain cautious on North America, we expect modest sequential improvement in Q4 with stronger trends in DTC offsetting continued softness in wholesale. In Europe, fourth quarter sales are still expected to be negatively impacted by the earlier timing of wholesale shipments. Excluding this impact, we expect underlying trends in Europe to increase slightly in Q4. And in Asia, we anticipate growth will be closer to our full year guide for the region of up low double digits, as we lap a more normalized compare following the easy COVID compares in Q1 and Q3. We expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand approximately 350 to 400 basis points in constant currency. Largely driven by gross margin expansion with about 40 and 50 basis points of negative foreign currency impact on our operating and gross margin, respectively. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% for the full year due to discrete tax benefits recognized in Q3 and roughly 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter. And capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $200 million to $225 million. In closing, Ralph's vision has always been about inspiring people to step into the dream of a better life and this holiday quarter was no exception. We are proud of our team's strong execution on our next great chapter accelerate plan through what continues to be a highly dynamic operating environment. We are focused on what we can control, shifting to GTC, harnessing big data and AI and of course, operating and balance sheet discipline. This puts us in a position of strength as we continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Matt Boss : Thanks and congrats on a great quarter. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Matt. Jane Nielsen : Thanks, Matt. Matt Boss : So Patrice, relative to mixed results across retail, Ralph Lauren clearly stands out as a winner over the holiday period here. What gives you confidence that you can maintain this momentum in a volatile backdrop? And then, Jane, any constraints to achieving the mid-teens constant currency operating margin target as we think about next year? And maybe as we think multiyear, do you see this as a ceiling for the business, or how best to think about longer-term operating margin opportunity? Patrice Louvet : Good morning, Matt. Thank you for your question. What I would say is resilience is built into every facet of our approach so we can stay on offense as we pursue sustainable long-term growth. So what gives us confidence? A few things to call out. First, we continue to invest in our brand and our way of living so that we can continue to deliver cut through cultural moments and drive desirability across regions and demographics. Listen, our focus on high impact Q2 and Q3 marketing really enabled us to hit the ground running coming into this holiday season. And it helped accelerate consumer metrics, top-line outperformance and the continued elevation in what I think we can all say was a pretty promotional environment. The second point is really around our products, right? And our broad portfolio of iconic core products, transcend trends, really focused on style and elegance, not on trends and allow us to flex as consumer needs evolve. The third area regard to our go-to-market model and our DTC channels. In DTC, I think as you know well, now represents about 2/3 of the company. So a majority of the business is DTC for Ralph Lauren. And the DTC channels are really where the world of Ralph Lauren comes to life most powerfully, where we engage most directly with the consumer and have the most ability to impact the consumer experience. And that's where we've invested most. And we delivered healthy comp growth across all of our direct-to-consumer channels this quarter, including our Ralph Lauren stores, our own digital sites and outlets in Asia, in Europe and in North America. So as you've seen, our plan is supported by multiple drivers of growth. It's not based on a single area, but diverse opportunities across categories, channels across key cities in every single region. And I think this is really evident from Q3 with double-digit growth, not just in China, up 30% in China. We're really proud of the team doing that. But also proud of the work our teams are doing in Japan, Korea, Germany, where we grew double digits in this quarter as well. And North America, which saw positive comp results across our DTC channels this quarter as well. Our core product is working, that's about 70% of the company. Women's and high potential categories more broadly are also working. So this is underpinned by our agility and operational discipline muscles, which have been built over time. And I think you see them in action during this last quarter. You can see the way we're managing our inventories. You can see the way our diversified global supply chain is helping us navigate volatility all around the world. And we expect this to continue to serve us really nicely moving forward, knowing that volatility is really our new normal. So Matt, our model is resilient. It's differentiated we've created a sustainable approach for long-term growth and value creation in these dynamic times. And I'll let Jane provide perspective on margin. Jane Nielsen : Yes, Matt. So we are still firmly committed to our 15% constant currency operating margin. We think it's the right goal for our businesses. And specifically to your question, do I see any constraints? Obviously, we're operating in a volatile and dynamic operating environment. We're not immune to that. But what gives me confidence is our organization's agility to address those changes, navigate them effectively and lean into our multiple engines of growth, be it different geographies, be it different products, be it different channels that we drive as you saw us drive DTC this quarter so effectively. And I don't view 15% as a ceiling at all. That's why we've identified these high potential categories in women's handbags and planting seeds in homes that those businesses can scale over the longer term and provide new engines for growth and profitability. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Michael Binetti : HI, guys. Great quarter. Thanks for taking our questions here. I guess a couple tactical ones. North America, 15% wholesale decline in the quarter. Nice to see you guys controlling it where you can in the D2C business. On that number, though, I think you said POS in wholesale was well ahead of sell-in on wholesale. But it sounds like AURs are increasing in the channel and you're maintaining a cautious posture there still. Is there a point on the horizon where you see those two numbers can start to converge, Jane a little bit. And also, I guess, Europe as a stand out here. I want to make sure I understood the 11% growth rate would have been 5 points higher in the quarter that comes out of the fourth quarter. But even with that, it looks like you're planning for a deceleration in Europe in the fourth quarter. I know you've been planning that market very cautiously for a long time. It's nice to see you coming in above your above your guidance. But is maybe a little bit more context on what you think the underlying growth rate is in Europe in the fourth quarter and how we should think about that market for '24? Are you seeing any less pressure on the wholesale side there? Maybe just a little bit of color, please? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Let me start with your first question on wholesale. So we did see our sell-in down 15% in North America. What's encouraging is that our sellout was down about mid-single digits in the quarter. And we had low single-digit increases in AUR. Now Michael, what's underscoring that is we wanted to be competitive, we didn't intend to be moved backward in that channel through the holiday season. We were intentional about our sell-in as we came off a softer spring and fall, we wanted to make sure that our receipts reflected a more cautious view of seasonal inventory, and we were able to backfill into stronger core and replenishment items. So as I look into the future, especially in the fourth quarter, I see more balance between sell-out and sell-in. And I think the expectation of what we saw in sell-out this quarter is a good indicator of what we'll see in Q4. And then on Europe, we were really pleased with what we saw in Europe this quarter. Overall, our business performed above our expectations. We had solid growth in every market with some softness in the U.K. based on the inflation and some consumer pressures that we had there. But really, we saw strong continued full digital pure-play strength as well as good wholesale strength with accelerating DTC trends. So some of the investments that we've talked about specifically in North America also paid dividends in Europe as we invested back in service and really saw marketing momentum with our new consumers. As I think about Q4, we do remain cautious. It's an inflation pressured environment. Obviously, the situation in the Middle East and the situation in the Ukraine are closer in on Europe. I see some pressures in Europe and in Spain with inflation. But I do see that over the course of the quarter what you'll see in wholesale is the underlying growth is going to be pretty stable. And then, we're going to come in, as we talked about in Europe with some ups and downs and some timing shifts that we expect Europe to perform in the low single-digit range for the year. Again, I know there's some quarter-to-quarter volatility based on timing shifts. Patrice Louvet : And maybe I'll just add one data point on your first perspective, which is on North America wholesale where indeed need to be cautious moving forward. We are encouraged by our digital wholesale performance this past quarter, which was up mid-single digits. So the challenge really is stores, driving traffic in the stores, running conversion in the stores working closely with our wholesale partners to activate this. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Thank you so much. So maybe, Patrice, just to follow up on those last comments. Can you just talk about your enthusiasm for your direct consumer business, particularly opening stores, given the comments you made in the opening remarks. Can you maybe just compare how you feel about it now versus, say, 90 days ago? Patrice Louvet : Still is enthusiastic, Jay. So if I step back a little bit, just think about our go-to-market model, really focused on top 30 cities around the world building an ecosystem that is led by DTC, but incorporates quality wholesale within that. And we know, as we look at our footprint, particularly in North America and in Europe or in China, actually, that we have opportunities to expand our full-price store presence. And you've seen us do this at a relatively healthy clip probably most actively in China, but more recently in Europe and in North America. As we think through the model going forward, Jay, we're still going to operate with this focus on the top 30 cities, build this ecosystem and lean into DTC. So I mentioned earlier, DTC is about 2/3 of the company. We expect that percentage to increase over time. Because that's really where we have the opportunity to better engage with the consumer and provide a full raw foreign experience. This being said, quality wholesale continues to play a role in the mix moving forward. We've committed to a number of store openings during Investor Day, and we still stay true to that but this year, it's about 80 stores. Jane Nielsen : And we're still on track for about 250 new doors over the 3-year time horizon. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Good morning and thank you for taking our question. Healthy improvement in the outlet channel again this quarter. And I know a lot of ground has been covered on DTC, but I was hoping you could elaborate on the changes that are working best there and your plans for further actions to drive continued accelerated improvement from here in outlet in both North America and Europe. Thank you. Jane Nielsen : Yes. So Brooke, we were really pleased with what we saw in the outlet channel. And what we see working is that the investments that we've made in our brands are paying off across our channels. But it's particularly in the outlet channels, we've seen nice solid growth in traffic across all three regions. Additionally, some of the very targeted promotion activities that we did during the peak holiday selling period worked very effectively, especially in the outlet channel. And we're able to do that while still increasing AUR across all three regions. We also see a role for the investments that we made in service. So we increased our service in our stores, and we're seeing conversion as a result of that. Obviously, brand investments and service investments are durable groups over time. And as we said, we'll be led by our consumers on our elevation journey and be very targeted in addressing some of our value-oriented consumers over time. Operator : Next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. Jane, I think you mentioned for the fourth quarter, the operating margin on a constant currency basis will be up 350 to 400, that's largely driven by gross margins. If I recall correctly, Jane, turn of the commodities into tailwind doesn't really happen until the last month of the quarter. So I'm just curious to know like how -- what the drivers are for that gross margin for the fourth quarter? And then if you could possibly for the audience, maybe quantify how much cotton was a headwind over the last few years. Is it fair to assume that it was about 300 basis points cumulatively. And if that's the case, how do we think about that as it turns into a tailwind? Thank you very much. Jane Nielsen : Good morning, Laurent, and thank you for the question. So you're right. We've guided 350 to 400 basis points largely driven by that's the equal guidance that we gave in gross margin. So it's driven by gross margin. And so SG&A becomes a neutral factor. And we still will have over 100 points of tailwind from freight, even with consideration of the resi as we come into the fourth quarter. So that's a durable factor for us as we exit this year. We're going to have favorable benefits from channel and geographic mix about similar, I think, to what you saw this quarter. There are two big changes. The big change is that cotton becomes a tailwind at the very end of the quarter. It's been a meaningful headwind over the course of the year of about 110 basis points. So as it becomes a tailwind, the pressure that we felt from cotton has reduced significantly. Also AUR growth becomes a more powerful driver in gross margin. as we expect our AUR trajectory to be about similar, we expect to get more efficiency, especially in our promotion lever. You saw us be quite focused in the holiday quarter as we come into the fourth quarter, we'll be less focused and we have less inventory that have to go out at end-of-season sale. So that's a gross margin benefit. I just want to be clear that cotton still a slight headwind in the quarter, but again, vastly reduced. And that's the key drivers that we see as I look at cotton over the last several years. It's important to note that even today, cotton still about 25% above pre-COVID levels. So it hasn't gone down to pre-COVID levels. And I expect that, that with the best visibility that we have, that's about a stable point for cotton. But it's actually been a little less than the 300 basis points, Laurent. I would say it's been about 110 basis points this last year and a little over 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the previous year. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. Chris Nardone : Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Just wanted to know how to think about the impact your operating margin next year in a scenario where wholesale sell-in starts to improve globally. And then I heard you loud and clear on reiterating the 15% constant currency target for operating margins next year. But can you provide an update on where we are in your cost savings program that you outlined at your Investor Day and your ability to pull that lever if sales and macro volatility continues this year? Thank you very much. Jane Nielsen : Yes. So Chris, what we see as we talk about a more balanced focus between sell-in and sell-out, next year, we think that, that it will be a favorable dynamic in terms of OI margin expansion, and we can couple that with the momentum that we're seeing in our DTC channel. So we view that as favorable. Although in aggregate, we're still cautious about the channel as we enter into fiscal '25, but we don't expect to see the level of sell-in decline that you saw, particularly in North America this quarter. And then from our $400 million gross savings plan, we are on track for that plan. We delivered about 1/3 of it in fiscal '23. We'll deliver another 1/3 in fiscal '24. The difference between '23 and '24 is it's a little more balanced in our cost of goods sold line versus the SG&A line. And we feel we're on track delivering the full $400 million as we close out the year. And of course, we'll be very disciplined about resource allocation. We've made some significant investments this quarter and this year, and we'll expect those investments to scale [in a year] [ph] growth and profitability as we go into fiscal '25. Operator : Next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Congrats on the results, the 9% comps and another strong quarter. Patrice, you talked about women's, home, accessories, handbags in particular, as incremental growth categories. Can you remind us where we are as a percent of the mix with some of those categories and how those have trended since you put out the targets for the next great chapter plan in 2022? Patrice Louvet : John, we haven't guided specifically in terms of the relative percentages. We did say that the women's opportunity was quite meaningful. 56% of our customers walking into our stores or shopping on our website are women and yet women's has represented less than 25% of the company's business. So you can expect that percentage to go up, but we haven't guided specific breakouts. We do have a lot of confidence in the potential of these categories. We're really pleased with the customer response across our women's portfolio. Women's really led the dance this quarter again and really resonating nicely. Outerwear is also a category that we're leaning in. You've heard others say, the season was challenging and certainly, the temperatures were maybe a little milder than anyone would have liked. But outerwear outperformed for us again this quarter, teams doing a great job developing a line of products across different outerwear categories that's really resonating. And as we look ahead, we still see a lot of runway, particularly on women's outerwear. Moving forward, strong performance with our handbag business. We launched the RL888, which was hard to miss in a number of our key cities around the world, very nice response to that. with continued momentum on the Polo ID bag and the little partnership or not little, but the partnership we had with Mr. Bag in China. And also good progress on home with new capability building as we bring in our new licensing partner on furnishing. All in all, all these categories are AUR accretive. So if you think about the different categories I laid out, when you look ahead in terms of what's going to be accelerators for the company, both in absolute top line and from an AUR and margin standpoint. We look forward to continuing to build on the momentum that we have in these spaces. Operator : Your next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the nice results. Just as you think about your channels of growth and obviously, DTC being so much more important than wholesale, or the interesting things on wholesales, the stronger results that you saw in Europe this quarter with the reorder trends. Anything we should be thinking about the wholesale business and reorder trends in Europe and what it could mean for North America? Is there anything to parse apart on North America? And then just lastly on the whole digital side of the business, what are you seeing in terms of the mix, whether is it AUR growth? Is it new customer activation? Is it more from existing customers and how you see that growing as a percent of sales? Thank you. Jane Nielsen : So just in terms of what we saw in Europe in wholesale, we were really pleased with what we saw overall in wholesale, especially as we look at Europe growth on an underlying basis, where it was even stronger. I think as we step back the differentiator in Europe is the wholesale channel itself is more elevated. And our Ralph Lauren Consumer is also more elevated. And that doesn't mean we don't have learnings that can apply in North America. I think as we look at assortment composition and as we look at marketing opportunities with our wholesale partners, Europe has some great best demonstrated practices and there's certainly an opportunity to cross-pollinate those issues. But those are the primary differences in what we see in terms of performance. Patrice Louvet : And then, Dana, on the digital front, let's start with North America. So North America comps were up 4% digital. It was really driven by traffic, all right? That was the key traffic. We saw improvements on conversion basket size. What's really exciting in the new consumers that we are recruiting. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're up 1.7 million new consumers this last quarter is the momentum we have on brand is attracting higher value younger consumers, and we're seeing that play out very clearly in digital. If I look at the other regions, we were super pleased with the performance in Europe with digital at 12%. This was also driven by very strong traffic during the holiday events and new capabilities that the teams have put in place there. And then, finally, Asia, which is a smaller base and newer flagships also a very strong momentum, up 25% versus plus 21% last compare. And I think same thing new consumers, higher-value consumers, younger consumers, progress on conversion. And listen, as we look at this channel for the future, we still see significant runway. This business is a little less than 30% of our total company. We had guided to continued acceleration within this channel. As we build new capabilities, we just launched a new search engine in the U.S. also we mapped our product presentations, we expect to see continued progress in this space. So we feel good about the results that the teams are achieving across all three regions with more to come. Operator : Our final question comes from Rick Patel with Raymond James. Rick Patel : Good morning, Jane. I will add my congrats as well. How should we think about the flow-through of outperformance as we go forward? Because for the year, it looks like you raised guidance for gross margins, but less so on operating margins. So curious which areas might be getting incremental spend here? And then, secondly, just zooming out which areas of the business will you look to distort investments to as we think about continuing the strong momentum? Jane Nielsen : So Rick, I think as we look at flow-through on outperformance, it's really going to be about the cadence of our investments and continuing to stay focused on our productivity metrics. As you do look at flow-through especially on the gross margin line, DTC, while we've been able to, on wholesale softness lean into DTC, which is a good thing. It is our strategy. The gross margin does have to cover some of that higher level of SG&A. We've been able to, I think, with real agility balance that. And of course, as we look forward, we'll look at that balance between slowing through outperformance and making investments in our business. As we have looked at where to invest in our business, we're very encouraged by the investments that we've made in digital. You know that, that's an important part of our future, and we're going to continue to make those investments. equally developing our ecosystem. As I said earlier, we are on track for delivering 250 new stores over the 3-year time horizon. We believe that stores are an important part of our brand presentation and our customer service experience. So you'll see us continue to drive that. And then finally, our brand. One of the things that we are proudest of this quarter is the momentum in our brand and our underlying health with our consumer. Our NPS score was higher, our purchase intent score was higher, our value perception score was higher. And so we believe in our brands, we will always invest in it and we think it will pay dividends not only in the short-term but in the long-term. Patrice Louvet : All right. Well, this is the end of our call. So thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and year-end results with you in May. And until then, take care, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As we close out year two of our next great chapter Accelerate Plan, we are proud to have delivered strong progress once again on our core strategic and financial commitments. Supported by the incredible dedication and agility of our teams, this year's performance underscores, both the strength and resilience of our multi-levered plan. In particular, we drove progress on, first, clearly increasing the desirability of our timeless brand, which is resonating with consumers of all ages and enabling continued pricing power in the market. Second, leveraging the breadth and authenticity of our lifestyle portfolio of products. And third, continuing on our long-term strategic pivot toward direct-to-consumer channels, which now represent about two-thirds of our total business compared to 55% when I joined the Company. This is where we can drive the best expression of our brand and own customer engagement while reducing our exposure to wholesale. All of this is underpinned by our key enablers and culture of operating discipline. These are key differentiators behind our consistent execution, which enable us to fuel our strategic growth initiatives for the long term. We closed out fiscal year '24 with solid fourth-quarter performance, including top line growth and operating margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. For the full year, we delivered 3% top line growth with 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, driving more than 20% adjusted EPS growth. Results were at the high end of the targets we laid out last May, even with unexpected macro headwinds across several of our key markets throughout the year. This year's performance also puts us firmly on track with our long-term financial commitments and demonstrates continued progress across our three strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include, first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand, second, drive the core and expand for more, and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights from the fourth quarter and year. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. Ralph Lauren is at the intersection of culture, spanning fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming, and music moments as we expand across geographies and demographics. And our team put our brand at the forefront of the conversation this year. From our iconic runway shows in New York City and Milan, the Singles Day activations in China, Fortnite gaming partnerships, and Taylor Swift on the cover of Time. This strong momentum continued through the fourth quarter. Key campaigns included, first, our sponsorship of the Australian Open Tennis Championship in January, which was officially the world's most-attended Grand Slam of all times. Now in our fourth year, the tournament is quickly becoming one of the most iconic events of our sports calendar across social media, our on-court uniforms and off-court spectator style. Our brand was featured on more than 700 celebrities and friends of the brand, including Korean pop sensation Crystal Young, Elle Macpherson, and comedian Celeste Barber. This enabled us to significantly extend our brand reach with over 400 million social media impressions globally. In March, we released the second capsule of our groundbreaking Polo Ralph Lauren Artist and Residence campaign, focused on empowering and celebrating artisans within the communities that have historically inspired our designs. Together, the first two capsules featuring Navajo designer Naiomi Glasses generated more than 6 billion PR impressions, and the collaboration represented our second-highest online search trend of the year. Our Lunar New Year activations across social platforms like Douyin and WeChat also generated another successful holiday event with high single-digit sales growth significantly outpacing peers and double-digit growth in new customers in China. In the world of gaming, we want to congratulate Ralph Lauren-sponsored e-sports team T1 for winning the League of Legends World Championship this year. T1 became the most winning team in gaming history and drove important visibility for our brand as we continue to recruit new younger consumers through exciting digital platforms. We also outfitted iconic celebrities, including Beyonce on her new Cowboy Carter album tour, and Reba McEntire at the Super Bowl. Both were radiant in Western-inspired ensembles, one of Ralph Lauren's signature design coats. And beyond the quarter, we continue to drive excitement across the worlds of fashion and sports, including our Intimate Fall 24 Women's Collection fashion show here in New York City a few weeks ago, and the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris, where we are once again the official outfitter of Team USA, a cherished partnership since 2008. These activations are driving strong sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and engagement. In fiscal '24, we added over 5 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, consistent with our long-term expectations. Our brand consideration, purchase intent, and especially our net promoter scores all increased to last year, led by next-generation under 35 consumers and women. And we grew our followers on social media by low-double digits to last year to over 58 million, led by Instagram, Line, Douyin and TikTok. Ralph pioneered a company of firsts from our earliest forays into fashion-sponsored sports partnerships to our popular coffee shops and restaurants that drive viral social media engagement. And our teams will continue to drive brand heat and elevation by leading on next-gen platforms and leveraging our powerful new data science models to drive lifetime consumer value. Moving next to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. As the market continues to demonstrate, consumers are turning to brands they know and trust and styles that live beyond one season. In addition to our powerful brand, Ralph Lauren has one of the most authentic, recognizable and broad-based portfolios of lifestyle offerings in the world, one that resonates across our diverse customer base and sets us apart from other brands. And Ralph and our design teams continue to create and reimagine beautiful styles that capture the modern consumer's changing lifestyle through our unique lens while also embodying the quality, craftsmanship, and sophistication that have come to define our brand. Our core products, which now represent more than 70% of our business, grew low-single digits in the fourth quarter and high-single digits for the full year ahead of total Company growth. Performance in core was led by our cable knit, cool neck and polo bear sweaters, transitional outerwear, iconic mesh polos, linen shirts and shirt jackets, and sophisticated casual sports coats. Our Polo player chino caps as seen on Kendall Jenner and Jennifer Lawrence are also resonating strongly with existing customers while attracting new next-gen customers as a trend-right entry point to the brand. As we continue to build on the long-term foundation of our core, we also delivered strong growth in our high-potential categories, including women's, outerwear and home. Together, these categories increased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and high-single digits for the full year. This strong performance was driven by both outerwear and women's. Women's now comprises about 29% of total Company sales, up 100 basis points to last year and still represents our most significant long-term growth opportunity. Top sellers in women's this quarter included our iconic cable knit and polar bear sweaters, linen and seasonless chambray shirts, cable knit polos, lightweight outerwear, and short dresses. In addition, this fiscal year, we moved our directly-operated furniture business to a highly experienced licensed partner with proven success in luxury furniture design, production and distribution. While we still see significant long-term growth opportunities for the category, this move will enable us to better serve our home customers and expand the category with elevated products and white glove service consistent with our brand. With the transition now complete, this will enable us to put even more emphasis on handbags, a directly operated business as our third high-potential category. Other exciting releases this quarter included the successful launch of our newest fragrance, Polo 67, with a global campaign featuring New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge, and our Lunar New Year, Year of the Dragon capsule, celebrating prosperity and opportunity with both strong AUR and sell-through rates. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive our core icons, while leveraging the breadth of our brand and assortments to fuel excitement and desirability. Turning to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world are driving elevation and consistency across all of our consumer channels and touchpoints. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites, where we offer our most elevated consumer experiences and engagement. During the year, we drove strong DTC comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets. Comps were up mid-single digits in both our brick-and-mortar stores and digital channels. Globally, we opened a total of 78 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities with the majority in Asia. This includes several iconic Ralph Lauren stores over the past year, notably new stores in Amsterdam, Singapore, Prague, and Charlotte; our first TCD ecosystem in Canada, including our first Toronto store and the launch of our Canadian digital flagship, and our first Ralph's Coffee shops in Paris and Dubai. And we continue to develop and test new concepts, including our latest opening, a new women's polo store on Cat Street in Tokyo, which sits at the epicenter of Tokyo's street fashion culture with more to come. By region, growth was led by Asia, consistent with our long-term plan, followed by a better-than-expected performance in Europe and North America. China was once again a standout with sales up low-double-digits this quarter over a more normalized post-COVID compare, and up 30% for the full year. Our China business has more than doubled versus pre-pandemic levels, now representing 7% of total Company sales with significant growth opportunities still to come. Our expansion remains disciplined as we largely focused on our key city clusters, supported by highly dynamic local marketing and digitally led ecosystem expansion to recruit new customers to the brand and elevated assortment of high-quality icons that align particularly well with the old money or quiet luxury aesthetic and the strong continued execution of our local teams. And finally, touching on our enablers. Our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter and year. First, as part of our focus on delivering best-in-class digital technology and analytics. Over the past several years, we have embedded a culture of operating discipline, including more rigorous inventory management. To further support this, we started testing our sophisticated predictive buying model in Asia and Europe stores this year. This AI-driven model enables better in-stock availability on sizing and best-selling products to drive incremental sales and improve conversion. Based on the pilot's early success, we plan to continue scaling its use to around 25% of our international DTC businesses in fiscal '25. And as we continue to embed citizenship and sustainability in everything we do, we were proud of the recognitions we received this year, in particular, being named one of Forbes World's Best Employers in 2023, a top-rated ESG performer by Sustainalytics, and the Best Company for Women to Advance by parity.org for the fourth consecutive year. In closing, Ralph's unwavering vision of authenticity and timeless style is resonating around the world, transcending fashion trends and generations. From the easy elegance of our runways to the incredible energy and thrill of sports partnerships, Ralph Lauren continues to define a luxury lifestyle that is uniquely our own. This year's performance keeps us firmly on the offense, delivering across our multiple drivers of growth with a plan that is not dependent on any single channel, geography, or category. All of this is supported by the dedication, passion, and agility of our teams who are executing with excellence to bring our brand to life through our dynamic campaigns and consumer experiences in stores and online. And as we look to fiscal '25, we will continue to drive this brand momentum and consistently execute on our plan, all while investing in our key strategic priorities to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value-creation. And before I hand it off to Jane to discuss our financial results, you will have seen from this morning's press release that we named Justin Picicci, our new Chief Financial Officer. Jane will continue in the role of Chief Operating Officer through fiscal '25, while ensuring a seamless CFO transition. Ralph and I are incredibly grateful for her leadership and impact in the CFO position, helping to guide our Company through significant transformation over the past seven years. And we look forward to continue partnering with Jane as COO. And we're excited to welcome Justin, who steps into the CFO role effective today, and will join us on our next earnings call. With nearly 20 years at the Company, Justin is an experienced leader who has worked closely with Jane and me, and successfully served in a range of senior finance roles at Ralph Lauren around the world. Ralph, the Board, Jane, and I have the utmost confidence in our ability to deliver together continued strong growth and value creation, building on the foundations we've established. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '24 was an important year for Ralph Lauren. Our teams executed exceptionally well in what continues to be an uncertain broader operating environment. We delivered on the financial and strategic commitments we laid out over a year ago. We continued to elevate our consumer experiences, products, and storytelling, driving both our continued shift towards higher-value consumers and 28 consecutive quarters of AUR growth. And our timeless brand brought truly iconic moments that only Ralph can deliver to our consumers around the world. We achieved all of this while continuing to drive greater efficiencies and invest in our long-term strategic priorities to enable future sustainable growth. In addition, we returned approximately $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year, on track with our Investor Day commitment to return approximately $2 billion through fiscal '25. And this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend for fiscal '25. Let me take you through our financial highlights, which as a reminder are provided on a constant-currency basis. Total Company fourth quarter revenue growth of 3% exceeded our expectations, driven by continued strength in DTC and better-than-expected sequential improvement in wholesale. This year's earlier Easter contributed around 50 basis points to Q4 results as planned, but will negatively impact next quarter. By region, Asia once again led our performance with sales increasing high-single-digits. North America grew 2%, and Europe was up slightly, both ahead of our expectations. Total Company comp increased 6%, led by strong performance across brick-and-mortar channels. Total digital ecosystem sales, including owned sites and wholesale digital accounts grew mid-single digits supported by strong results in our owned and pure-play sites in Europe. Total Company adjusted gross margin expanded 510 basis points in the quarter and 210 basis points for the full year. This was significantly above our outlook driven by low double-digit AUR growth, lower freight expense, and favorable channel and geographic mix for both the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter promotions were lower in all three regions, helped by lower end-of-season inventories following our strong holiday sell-throughs. Cotton costs had a neutral impact on fourth quarter gross margin. As previously indicated, cotton will ramp into a tailwind in fiscal '25 and '26 after two years of cost pressures. We still expect healthy AUR gains this year, driven by our growing brand desirability, ongoing product mix elevation, and favorable geographic and channel mix. However, we expect AUR growth to rely less on like-for-like pricing as cotton costs moderate. Adjusted operating expenses grew 5% to 57.9% of sales, up 90 basis points to last year. The increase was primarily driven by investments in talent and marketing. Marketing was 7% of sales, up from 6% last year to support key brand moments, delivering continued momentum in our brand health metrics, notably our net promoter scores. Full-year marketing was also 7% of sales, in line with our annual guidance. Adjusted operating margin expanded 410 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points for the full year. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Fourth quarter revenue grew 2% to last year as stronger growth in retail more than offset a 2% decline in wholesale. In North America retail, fourth quarter comps increased 3% led by mid-single-digit comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores. Key actions we took in the first half of the year continued to benefit our outlet performance, including improved staffing, selling environments and product presentation. Our outlet AUR increased double-digits with lower discount rates to last year. In our digital channel, comp trends were softer, but AUR increased as expected following a stronger Q3 holiday period. In North America wholesale, revenues declined 2%, a significant improvement from the first three quarters of the year. Our sell-out also improved sequentially, down low-single digits, aligning more closely to sell-in this quarter, while AUR in the channel increased to last year. We continue to manage our wholesale business carefully into fiscal '25, given broader channel headwinds, including regular assessment of our brand presence on a door-by-door basis. We are planning for North America wholesale declines to moderate from fiscal '24 levels with Q1 and Q3 trending below our full-year expectations based on timing of wholesale shipments. Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased slightly ahead of our expectations. Results included about 3 points of negative impact from the timing of wholesale deliveries, including rerouting of shipments from the Red Sea. Performance was driven by retail comps up 12% on top of the strong 8% compared last year with double-digit growth in both our brick-and-mortar stores and digital sites. While the competitive environment remained highly promotional, our elevated brand positioning and growing brand desirability delivered double-digit AUR growth with further reductions in discount rates. Europe wholesale declined 8% to last year, including about 5 points of headwinds from a shift in timing of wholesale deliveries, as well as lower off-price sales due to cleaner inventories coming out of the holiday. Similar to Q3, we drove strong growth in wholesale reorders, particularly due to restocking at our largest pure-play account. For the full year, Europe wholesale declined low-single digits. Looking to fiscal '25, we expect underlying growth in the channel to improve to a more normalized low single-digit levels with some continued quarterly choppiness from the timing of shipments. While our Europe business performed better than expected through the year and sell-out trends are encouraging, we remain cautious into fiscal '25, given highly dynamic geopolitical and macro conditions in the region. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 7% with growth across all markets. Asia retail comps were up 6% with strong growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased low double digits on top of an unusually strong reopening compare of 40% last year, including another successful Lunar New Year event. All of our other key markets, Japan, Korea, and Australia also grew during the fourth quarter and full year on top of strong compares. Moving to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow continue to be key enablers of our fortress foundation. They allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We generated exceptionally strong cash flow in fiscal '24 with more than $900 million in free cash flow, exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. We ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory was healthy, 14% lower than last year, and well below our revenue trends. The reduction was better than our plan following stronger-than-expected sell-through rates over the holiday. As we enter fiscal '25, inventory levels are well-positioned relative to our outlook for each region. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop, as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending-related headwinds, potential supply-chain disruptions, and foreign currency volatility among others. For fiscal '25, we expect constant-currency revenues to increase low-single digits, centering on about 2% to 3%. Our outlook continues to include stronger growth in DTC versus caution around the wholesale channel, where demand is improving but still challenged. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 90 basis points, driven primarily by Asian FX. Asia is still expected to lead our growth, up high-single digits, and on track with our targeted three-year algorithm. This is followed by Europe up approximately low-single digits and North America up slightly. Q1 and Q3 revenues are expected to trend below our full-year growth outlook based on planned timing of wholesale receipts in both quarters and lower Q1 excess sales in North America and Europe. We expect operating margin to expand about 100 basis points to 120 basis points to 13.5% to 13.7%. In constant currency, relative to our fiscal '22 Investor Day base period, we are on track to deliver our 15% target this year. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points to 100 basis points, driven by favorable cotton costs improving as we move through the year, further mix-shift towards international and DTC, and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting headwinds from incremental labor costs. The Red Sea disruption is currently expected to be a modest headwind on top of an otherwise neutral freight environment. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact fiscal '25 gross and operating margins by about 30 basis points. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be up slightly in constant currency with stronger trends in retail offsetting timing headwinds in wholesale. This includes about 50 basis points of negative impact from the Easter shift. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 160 basis points. We expect first quarter operating margin to expand approximately 60 basis points to 80 basis points in constant currency with roughly 140 basis points to 180 basis points of gross margin expansion more than offsetting higher operating expenses, which are weighted toward the first quarter due to the timing of marketing activations, notably the fashion show. Foreign currency is expected to have roughly 40 basis points of negative impact on both gross and operating margin in the first quarter. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the full year and roughly 24% to 25% for the first quarter. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $300 million to $325 million, in line with our long-term outlook of 4% to 5% of sales. This includes preliminary investments around our upcoming multiyear systems implementations, which include consolidation into a single global ERP, integrated business planning tools, and enhanced logistics automation. These initiatives will enable a fundamental transformation in our end-to-end processes as we become a more global DTC-oriented company, and greater efficiencies across demand planning, inventory buying, allocations and more. We currently anticipate about half of the project will be capitalized with annual CapEx remaining well within our long-term guidance range. And we expect to exclude the non-capitalized portion of the project spend from our adjusted earnings outlook, given the significant and unique nature of this large-scale multiyear transformation project. We will provide additional details as we finalize our plans in fiscal '25. In closing, through this second year of our next great chapter accelerate plan, our teams continue to execute with excellence and are truly embodying Ralph's vision of inspiring people to step into the dream of a better life. And as we continue to navigate and uncertain global environment, we remain laser-focused on our strategic priorities, our commitments, and driving what we can control. For the past seven years, it has been a privilege to be a part of Ralph's enduring and timeless vision, and Patrice's transformational leadership. I am immensely proud of what the team has accomplished over this time, including delivering on our commitments consistently and steadfastly, creating a culture of agility and operational excellence, and establishing a significantly more elevated brand and a profitable foundation for growth. And with these strong foundations in place, I am excited to have Justin step into the role of CFO. Justin is an accomplished leader with a track record of success over his long tenure at Ralph Lauren. And I have every confidence Justin and our talented team will continue to elevate our iconic brand, build our foundations, and drive continued value-creation. As this is my last earnings call in the CFO role, I want to thank all of you in the financial community for your support, your engagement, and for challenging us to consistently be better. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Thank you. First, Jane, I just want to say congratulations and thank you for all the great things you've done at Ralph Lauren at your time there and continued success as you transition to the COO role. I have two questions. First for Patrice. Jane Nielsen : Thank you, Jay. Jay Sole : You delivered on your fiscal '24 -- thank you, Jane. You delivered on your fiscal '24 targets and your guidance is calling for continued top line growth and operating margin expansion for fiscal '25, which will land you at your three-year targets. But the global environment still seems tough out there with competitors calling out challenges in Europe and China. Can you talk about what you are seeing in the business that will enable this continued momentum? And then secondly, just on the guidance for this year, how are you thinking about direct-consumer channel growth versus wholesale channel growth? Thank you so much. Jane Nielsen : Jay? Jay Sole : Hello? Can you still hear me? Jane Nielsen : Sorry. Can you repeat the follow-up question? Jay Sole : Yeah, sure. The second question is, can you talk about how you're thinking about DTC channel growth for fiscal '25 versus wholesale channel growth? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Sure. Well, good morning. So just on your first question and then Jane will cover your second question. Fiscal '24 was a strong proof point that our strategy continues to deliver, even with the continued macro and channel headwinds out there. And we were really encouraged that we were able to deliver at the high end of what we guided at the start of the fiscal year. And that we reinforced that we're on track with our three-year targets, both on the top and the bottom line, including our 15% operating margin constant-currency goal. Overall, I would say that the key areas of strength that we saw over the past fiscal year are what we expect to meet again in fiscal '25. Our strategy is working and we're going to continue to execute on the key tenants of it. So first, I'd say we're driving continued momentum in our brand elevation and brand heat. And you saw -- you heard in the script some of the key data that supports that with a lifestyle product offering that is really connecting with consumers around the world, whether that's in Shanghai, LA, or Paris. The Australian Open is actually, a really good example of a franchise that we've built in just a few short years, and our outsized growth in net promoter scores is an important indicator of our brand desirability and the strength of our business. And next up, we have Wimbledon, gaming championships, the Olympics, the US Open still to come this summer. So a lot of brand events that will help us continue to drive this brand [deep] (ph) and desirability around the world. Second is our pivot to DTC, and our pivot to DTC continues, right? You saw the strong performance this past quarter on comps for DTC, and in fiscal year '25, we expect DTC to lead growth again with healthy increases across both brick-and-mortar and digital channels following the in-store interventions we made over the last year and our online storytelling. And third, we're leaning into our multiple drivers of growth also from a regional standpoint. So Asia continues to scale up nicely with company-leading revenue growth and margins that are now strongly accretive to the total company. So like in fiscal '24, we expect positive growth across every market in Asia this coming year, led by China. And Europe has also outperformed our expectations despite all the macro headlines ranging from challenging consumer sentiment to high inflation. This speaks to our brand's strong and elevated positioning across the region and momentum across channels in the market, where we delivered the highest AUR growth last year. So we're obviously, not immune to market challenges. However, we talk a lot about agility in this Company, as well as our diversified drivers of growth. And this is serving us well as we focus on consistency of strong execution on top of all the moving parts. And then on guidance, I'll turn it over to you, Jane. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Jay, we continue to be optimistic and confident about our DTC growth. While we're still cautious about the macros, we're expecting our DTC growth to be in the range of we -- where we landed for this year in about a mid-single-digit growth range, and then we are expecting wholesale business in North America to be about better aligned to where we saw our sell-out in North America, which was down low to mid-single digits to be that second-half trend will continue through the full-year in North America. That's our call right now as we think about where we'll be. And then EMEA, you know, there is -- there's been some quarterly volatility. We expect there to be some quarterly volatility as we come into this next year, especially as we look at Q1 and Q3 due to shipment timing, but in general, we're looking for growth in European wholesale in that low single-digit range. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Great. Next question please, Angela. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. And, Jane, congratulations and continued best wishes at Ralph Lauren and after. And can we dig a little deeper into your outlook for North America this year? Outside of wholesale, which was still guided down, but moderating from the declines of the past year, how do you think about the rest of the business and margin opportunities? And can you reach your total operating margin target of 15% if the wholesale channel remains weaker? Then I have a quick follow-up. Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thank you, Dana. And let me start where you left off and just say that we are on track to achieve our 15% constant-currency target this year even with some modest declines from North America wholesale, and importantly, we expect all three regions to contribute to margin expansion. So we feel really good about the geographic diversity of our margin expansion this year. Let me just take a step back and take a high-level view on your question on North America and particularly North America wholesale. It now represents about -- North America wholesale now represents a meaningfully smaller percentage of our business, down from -- it's now about 16% of our business down from about 25% of our business previously. So the impact as we shifted to DTC has reduced meaningfully. And similarly to the broader company, we're really encouraged by our performance in the DTC channel, and that carries through to North America in this coming year. We expect DTC to continue to lead North America growth with healthy comps across our stores and digital, plus a handful of new store openings in North America. And on the wholesale side, while we still expect declines in North America, as I mentioned, we expect a meaningful improvement from where we landed this year at about 10%. We expect, as I said to be much more aligned to where we saw sell-out in the second half or in that down low-to-mid single-digit range, and we feel good about how our inventories are positioned in the channels. And we also are encouraged by the investments that we're making in wholesale. We continue to invest in the top 100 doors there and I feel good about our partnerships across that channel. On the gross margin side, we are expecting benefits from cotton costs and less channel mix pressure from wholesale, and that's expected to drive North America operating margin as we move into fiscal '25. Corinna Van der Ghinst : And your quick follow-up, Dana? Patrice Louvet : You have a follow-up. Yeah. Dana Telsey : Yeah. The follow-up on AUR, which has been so strong in the past few years, how are you thinking of the progression this year? And I think the target has been around mid-single digits that you stated. How should we be thinking about AUR growth going forward? Jane Nielsen : Yes, Dana. We're really proud of our AUR growth over the last 28 quarters. It's been grounded in brand elevation and it's been based on multiple factors that have driven AUR over the last years. And what we're confident about is that we can continue to drive AUR growth. We're going to drive it through brand mix, channel mix and geographic mix. Those things are durable and stable into the coming year. And we're going to have some pressure release for not having to take the -- so much like-for-like pricing because of the cotton benefits and productivity benefits that we see coming into this year. So as we look forward, we expect our AUR to be in the mid-single-digit range. And of course, there may be some variability by quarter. Any good plan has alternate strategies that we can execute at any given time, and we'll do that as we see the market evolve. But our outlook now and our guidance is grounded on that mid-single-digit range. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks, and congrats on your next chapter, Jane. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. Matthew Boss : So, Patrice, given your multi-year elevation effort, where do you see the brand positioned today, maybe versus your ultimate goal in both the US and Europe? And coming off the mid-single-digit global DTC comps, could you just elaborate on new customer acquisition trends that you're seeing? And then, Jane, just on SG&A, help us to think about SG&A relative to revenue growth moving forward. Patrice Louvet : Sure. Good morning, Matt. So first, I would say we feel really good about the progress we're making on the brand positioning and the brand elevation, right? And our core strategy continues to be, as Jane -- as she just mentioned, brand elevation because there's significant runway ahead for us around the world. What we are seeing in the consumer perception data is very encouraging, very strong brand consideration, score improvement, very strong, purchase intent strengthening, and net promoter scores that are building quarter-on-quarter. So feel very good about that. And I think, Matt, you know this business very well. What's pretty unique about us is the breadth of our portfolio and the breadth of our appeal, right, because we appeal to eight-year-olds and we appeal to two-month olds. We have this broad range of products. And I think our brand positioning at this point in time in particular with the core values of authenticity, timelessness, style, quality are really resonating around the world. The elevation is never going to stop. So you can expect us to continue to fuel that through our storytelling, through our product offering, and through the consumer experience that we offer, both online and in brick-and-mortar stores. In terms of new consumer recruiting, which is part of our lifeblood, right, we often talk about the fact that the key drivers of top line growth for us are going to be bringing in new consumers, select unit growth, and AUR growth as Jane just talked about. Another strong quarter of new consumer recruiting around the world, over 1 million for this quarter, 5.3 million for the full fiscal year, close to 60 million social media followers now, up double-digits. We -- our new consumer recruiting machine across our different DTC channels is working well. This is DTC data. Fortunately, we don't have wholesale data, but it's working well and we're going to continue to lean into that, leveraging the breadth of our marketing programs that range from the sports partnerships that we have with the Olympics coming up to celebrity dressing to different activations that we have in the gaming space and so on and so forth. So I'm very encouraged by the overall momentum that we're seeing on the brand by the breadth of the appeal, and one of that -- I think the major pivots that we've been able to achieve over the past few years is this appeal to that younger generation, making the brand hot again for that younger generation in every markets around the world, and we're going to continue to fuel that. Jane Nielsen : And then, Matt, just on the second part of your question on SG&A leverage. Our fiscal '25 guidance implies about 30 basis points of SG&A leverage on our about 3% constant-currency top line. That we expect will be pretty consistent as we look at the second, third and fourth quarters in the first quarter, driven by the fashion show. We do expect a little deleverage, but entirely driven by marketing. And so you'll start to see our SG&A growth be behind our revenue growth in -- following Q1. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question here. Jane, let me add my congrats. Thanks for all the help here over the years. I guess as we look at the AUR elevation strategy over a couple of years, I think the first parts of that strategy were in the DTC channel. I think you started working more recently on AURs in the wholesale channel. When you look at North America, in particular, given the guidance that you just gave us, how do we think about AUR versus units in that channel? I think you've been -- I think you're targeting trying to get units to a place of stability for a long time. I don't think it's probably stable or positive in the guidance you gave us. I'm just curious how you think about that this year and longer term. And then on North America, I guess the DTC growth, you gave us a number this year. I think you said mid-single digits for the year. Maybe this year and then longer term also how can we think about how much of that growth comes from the full-price channel compared to channels like the outlets? I know you've made a lot of progress changing what the shopping experience is in the outlets, but I think historically, that's been a little bit more of a price-constrained channel. So I'm curious how you see the portfolio evolving. Is more of the growth still going to come from the outlet channel, and how you balance that with what you want to do with AURs across the DTC business? Jane Nielsen : Sure. Thanks, Michael. One of the things as I step back from your question, we believe our brand elevation, our pivot to ecosystems and our pivot to DTC is going to continue to drive AUR growth into the future. So stepping back from that, in wholesale, we've always said that wholesale, especially in North America, is a few clicks behind what we've seen in DTC. I mean, we started this journey even pre-COVID saying we're going to lead with our DTC channels followed by wholesale. And we're very encouraged by what we've seen. In FY '23, we saw AUR -- strong AUR across wholesale in North America and in Europe. And that continued into FY '24, although as we closed out the year at a more moderate pace. We saw wholesale AUR growth in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And so we expect that to continue through FY '25. That will have some pressure on units, but we feel good about where the product mix is going in wholesale, our focus on those top 100 doors, and our ability to elevate that experience and elevate our product offerings in wholesale. We feel it's a strategy that's working. And you can see that in our guide coming into '25 where we expect a meaningful uptick, although not too positive in North America wholesale. And then just on DTC, what we've seen over the past two years is that our full-price stores have led our growth. What's encouraging to us with some of the investments that we've made in our outlet stores is that gap is narrowing. That's a positive thing because it means our outlet growth has accelerated. That's a dynamic that we're happy with and the dynamics that we expect to continue into FY '25. We expect that gap to be narrowed, but not based on a slowing, but based on better trends in outlet. Patrice Louvet : And I would also add, Michael, that we expect to continue to expand our full-price store footprint in the US so that will be an additional accelerator for the full-price business, which will continue to lead our overall DTC brick-and-mortar, whereas we do not expect to expand our outlet footprint. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Michael Binetti : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. Ashley Helgans : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. So we just wanted to ask about gross margins with the first quarter up kind of in the 140 bps to 180 bps range, for the rest of the year, 50 bps to 100 bps. If you could just kind of give us the puts and takes? And then any update you can give us on traction you're seeing with younger consumers that'd be great. Thanks. Jane Nielsen : I'm sorry. Ashley, could you just repeat the last part of your question? I got the gross margin puts and takes. Ashley Helgans : Yeah. Just any sort of traction that you can talk about that you're seeing with the younger consumers. Jane Nielsen : Just in terms of gross margin drivers, we were very pleased with our gross margin expansion in Q4 up 510 basis points in constant currency. That was really driven by a few things. One, strong AUR growth. And what drove that AUR growth was a favorable channel mix, favorable geographic mix, product mix, and a significant pullback in discount. As we came into the fourth quarter, we were super tight on inventory and had much less going into clearance or in off-price channels. We also saw from a gross margin standpoint after AUR growth that freight continued to be a tailwind for us of about 100 basis points. And of course, this was the quarter where cotton turned from a headwind, which we've seen for the first three quarters into being about neutral into the fourth quarter. Then we had some pressure from FX of about 30 basis points. And then as we look forward, Ashley, we are seeing in FY '25, our continued gross margin expansion of 50 bps to 100 basis points, largely premised on lower cotton costs and some significant cotton recapture. About half of the cotton that we expect to recapture about 90 basis points will come into this fiscal year, you know, being a little heavier weighted to the back half and continued channel and geographic mix. We, of course, expect AUR growth to continue with a few headwinds in terms of some small incremental Red Sea pressures that we see now, obviously, FX and the weaker yen and some other product costs, higher labor costs in some of our markets and some inflation in non-cotton materials. But overall, pleased with where we landed the year and encouraged by our continued gross margin expansion journey into fiscal '25. Patrice Louvet : And Ashley, on new consumers. So new consumer -- younger consumers are leading our new consumer recruiting as a whole. So our penetration of younger consumers is increasing so think next-gen below 35. Very encouraged to see that. We have very targeted marketing activations to enable this. So this isn't just a result of luck. It's by intent. I think some of the things that we're doing on gaming and I think we're all learning the vocabulary here because of our T1 team winning against our G2 team. So we're sponsoring. Gaming teams are performing particularly well. You heard in the prepared remarks that our T1 team won the Global World of [Allegiance] (ph) tournament globally. We have significant activation with celebrities as well and a lot of them are spontaneously wearing us, right? There's a lot of heat around our polo hats, especially among younger women consumers, Taylor Swift wearing it, Jennifer Lawrence wearing it, and the list goes on. We're clearly in the conversation. If you track what's happening in social media and the conversations going on there, you'll hear and you'll see talk about Ralph Core, which obviously, we're really pleased to see. So good energy on that front. Our net promoter scores are growing the fastest among our younger consumers as well. So clearly, the experience they're having on our site and in our stores is resonating with them. So very encouraged by what the teams are doing in the markets to recruit those young consumers. Listen, we know that's the lifeblood for the Company for the long term and we're going to continue to lean into that. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Ashley Helgans : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. John Kernan : Thanks for taking my question, and Jane, congrats. You've done a phenomenal job. Jane Nielsen : Thank you. John Kernan : Just on Europe. The comps in the direct business have really inflected here double-digits in the last two quarters. Its penetrate -- DTC penetration in Europe is a lot lower than North America. How do we think about DTC and wholesale in Europe with that -- the wholesale channel being a tough macro period right now? Patrice Louvet : We've been -- so yes, good reminder, John, that the context is challenging in Europe. But our teams are doing a terrific job, I think connecting with consumers and leveraging the different channels. You saw the DTC performance this past quarter up double-digits, both brick-and-mortar and digital. So really nice momentum. Our flagship stores are hitting record highs this year across different key cities in Europe. And -- so we expect to continue to drive that. We have really nice plans in terms of footprint expansion for stores across Europe. You remember at the beginning of this journey, we were at 19 stores across all of Europe, right? I don't have the exact number here, but I think we're closer to north of 50 stores at this point with actually more to come. So opportunities to continue to expand our footprint. The team is doing a great job driving comps in our full-price stores. On digital, there's really good momentum on our own digital, which we have a number of levers that we have now a good handle on that we're going to continue to push. And then on the -- so expect, I think the share of DTC to continue to expand, John. On the wholesale side, it has been -- it's a mix of both pure-play and obviously brick-and-mortar and then bricks and clicks. We've seen recent strength in -- with our pure players as we align strategies with what they're focused on, including our biggest pure-play partner in Europe, Zalando, where we're now both on an elevation strategy, which is serving us really, really nicely. We've done some reset this past year in Spain and in the UK for wholesale, consistent with our philosophy and approach in the US, both with the ECI and the Frasers Group. So working off a healthier foundation and feeling like the work that the teams are doing on the ground in terms of getting the brand connected to the consumer, to Ashley's earlier question, getting connected to that younger consumer is working well. So we remain cautiously optimistic about that region. We are not oblivious to your point, John, on all the headwinds out there, whether that's inflation, consumer sentiment, obviously, the two wars that are going on, which is why I think our guide -- we feel our guide is right based on the current conditions, but are excited about the momentum that the team is driving there. Jane Nielsen : Yeah. I would just summarize on the guide to say it's premise of more normalized wholesale trends and then solid continued comp growth across all DTC channels. So really encouraged. We recognize and I think are clear-eyed about the challenges from, as Patrice mentioned, the war, inflation pressures, but cautiously optimistic about it. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Great. Well, go ahead with our last question, Angela. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Thank you very much for taking me -- taking me as a last question. Patrice, I think you mentioned Asia will grow high-single digits, but will be led by China. I know you don't mention or don't talk about quarter-to-date trends, but just love to get your perspective on what you're seeing in China. And then Jane, I have to ask a modeling question for your last earnings call. How do we think about marketing as a percentage of sales for the year? And then I think you mentioned because of the activation in the first quarter around marketing, how do we think about it for the first quarter as well? Thank you very much. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Laurent. Listen, we're all really proud of our team's execution in China, and the momentum that's been built and that's been sustained over many quarters and years now. And China now represents about 7% of our total business. It was 3% prior to COVID. So clearly, strong growth and we expect it to lead the growth for the Company moving forward. I think that -- you're right that we don't comment on inter-quarter performance, but the general perspective on China is listen, the consumer is pressured, right? We know the consumer sentiment is challenging there, but we're continuing to do very well. We grew double-digits this past quarter on top of 40% the year prior because it was a COVID reopen quarter. So nice continued momentum across our key cities, strong AUR growth. What's really working there is the team is doing a great job connecting the brand with the local consumer, tapping into this whole quiet luxury moment. I think the core values of the company and what we stand for is really connecting with the consumer very effectively. Our core products, our staples, our icons are really resonating. So think cable knit sweaters, think our Oxford shirts, polo shirts, unconstructed jackets, we're seeing consumers lean into that. Then the ecosystem that we focus on these top six cities that we've historically called out is working quite effectively across the different channels. So strong performance this past quarter. We expect that to continue. Of course, you know, we have to take into account that the 30% growth we delivered this past fiscal year in China benefited from a weaker base period. So if you kind of remove that, we expect China to return to strong but more normalized compares following the different COVID lapse, still driven by the brand energy and the brand heat and the brand momentum that we have there. Ralph core also resonating there. Our -- the breadth of our product offering and the excellent execution of the team from an ecosystem standpoint, fueled in part by continued expansion, right? So not only do we have comp growth, but we're continuing to expand our footprint from a store standpoint. Jane Nielsen : Okay, Laurent, for my last question. Remember, Q1 is going to be -- we expect growth on a revenue basis to strengthen as we move into Q2, Q3 and Q4. But Q1 will represent a meaningful growth in marketing expense, up double-digits. And then as you look through the balance of the year as a percentage of sales, I think that what we spent in Q and in fiscal '24 is a pretty good proxy with a little more marketing expense growth in the second quarter given that that's the Olympic's quarter. Patrice Louvet : All right. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. On behalf of Ralph, myself, and the entire Ralph Lauren family, Jane, we want to express our deep appreciation for everything that you have achieved as you conclude your tenure as CFO of this company. We look forward and I look forward to continuing to partnering with you as our Chief Operating Officer. And we also extend a warm welcome to Justin, who several of you have already met and many of you will have the opportunity to meet in the coming months. We will host our virtual annual shareholder meeting and first quarter results in August. And until then, take care and have a great day.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice. Patrice Louvet : Thank you, Cori. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We started year-three of our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan with continued momentum, keeping us on track with our fiscal '25 and long-term strategic commitments. Our first quarter performance underscores the power and growing desirability of our iconic brand around the world with key moments that demonstrate our ability to resonate across cultures, geographies, and generations. This, combined with our diversified engines of growth and organizational agility, gives us confidence that our long-term strategy will continue to deliver, even through these dynamic times. First quarter results exceeded our expectations led by international and positive retail comps across all regions with continued momentum across consumer metrics. Performance in our global direct-to-consumer businesses and Europe wholesale more than offset planned softness in North America wholesale. At the same time, we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, including marketing, digital capabilities, and our targeted ecosystem expansion across our top cities. Fueled by our culture of operating discipline and increased efficiencies, these investments will enable us to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation well beyond our current three-year plan. During the first quarter, we drove continued progress across our three strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include, first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. Second, drive the core and expand for more. And third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights from the first quarter. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; from our recent activations in Milan, London, New York, and across China, to our rapidly expanding social media following, Ralph Lauren continues to be at the forefront of culture across geographies and demographics. Key campaigns from the quarter included, first, our women's collection runway show in New York City, this April, where we celebrated the timeless easy elegance that has come to define our brand. The collection also tapped into some of our signature design codes, from western motifs to shimmering liquid gowns, and cozy, rich cashmeres, signaling a confident, quite luxury as Ralph does best. The globally amplified event surpassed our goals, driving 16 billion PR impressions as we were joined by celebrities, including Jodie Turner-Smith, Jessica Chastain, Kerry Washington, Crystal Yuan, Rebecca Hall, and Morgan Spector. Heading into warmer months, we reinforced our position as the ultimate destination for effortless summer icons with our Only Polo campaign. Our teams delivered local activations spanning L.A.'s Sunset Boulevard, Roppongi in Tokyo, SoHo in New York, Miami's Design District, Dubai, and Seoul. The stars aligned in Milan at our Purple Label presentation, this June, where Usher, John Legend, Chris Pine, and Rufus Wainwright, among others, honored our newest collection as part of Men's Fashion Week. During the city's renowned home design fair, Salone del Mobile, we unveiled our first collection with our new licensing partner, and invited the international design community to experience American style in Milan. Our 6/18 activations in China drove high double-digit growth that significantly outpaced our competitive set. Our teams are leveraging these events for longer term brand building with a focus on high-quality sales and new customer acquisition. And finally, we're in the midst of a spectacular summer of sports. We kicked off our 2024 Paris Olympics campaign, unveiling our uniforms as official outfitter of Team U.S.A., a cherished partnership over nine Olympic Games, since 2008. And beyond the quarter, we celebrated our 19th year as official outfitter of the championships at Wimbledon, marrying the traditions of this storied tournament with sophisticated spectator style. These activations are driving strong sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and engagement. In the first quarter, we added 1.3 million new consumers through our DTC businesses, consistent with our long-term expectations and led by higher value and younger cohorts. Our net promoter scores increased globally led by Europe. And our online search grew strong double-digits, outpacing our competitive set. And we grew our social media followers by low teens to last year, surpassing 60 million, let by Instagram, Threads, Line, TikTok, and Douyin. Moving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. While many aspire to become true lifestyle brands, Ralph created a brand that has epitomized the aspirational lifestyle for over 50 years. And as we look ahead, Ralph and our design teams will continue to leverage our powerful portfolio of highly recognizable core products with expansion into newer categories to realize our brand's full potential. Starting with our core products, which represent more than 70% of our business, sales were up low single-digits, slightly ahead of our total company growth in the first quarter. Highlights from this spring included our linen styles, from sport shirts to tailored suits, newly re-launched stretch mesh Polos, elevated heavyweight jersey and Polo Bear tees and sweaters. In children's, linen also drove outsized growth, along with seasonal mini cable and flag sweaters, and our expansion within the Big Kids segment. Our high-potential categories, including Women's Apparel, Outerwear, and Handbags, together increased mid single-digits, outpacing our total company growth rate as we continue to drive our strategy of foundational pieces to anchor her modern wardrobe. Top sellers in Women's this quarter included our iconic cable knit sweaters, linen and oxford shirts, Polos, and shirt dresses in easier fits, and our canvas city jacket. Within Handbags, we drove strong growth led by Polo Women's, where continued momentum in our Polo ID collection is driving both revenues on higher AUR, as well as new customer recruitment, as highlighted by Jennifer Lawrence sporting our yellow Polo ID bag this spring. Other exciting releases this quarter included our Wimbledon capsule, featuring tennis-inspired sportswear with sell-throughs up strong double-digits to last year across Men's, Women's, and Kids. And our Summer Olympics collections, including our opening and closing ceremony uniforms and Olympic Village wear, an assortment of Polo sportswear icons retold through the sophisticated lens of Paris. Turing to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world are driving elevation and consistency across all of our consumer channels and touch points. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites, where we offer our most elevated consumer experiences and engagement. In the first quarter, we drove solid DTC comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets. Comps were up mid single-digits in both our brick-and-mortar stores and digital channels. Globally, we opened eight new owned and partnered stores, focused on our top cities, largely in Asia. And we recently welcomed consumers back into our newly-renovated Chicago flagship on Michigan Avenue. In addition to our famed RL restaurant, the store now also includes our first Ralph's Coffee shop in the Midwest. With more than 30 coffee shops and five restaurants, we are now engaging with over 3 million consumers annually through our hospitality business, attracting a new generation of consumers to our iconic brand around the world. By region, growth was led by Asia, up another high single-digit this quarter and consistent with our outlook. This was followed by better than expected performance once again in Europe while North America was in line with our plan. Our China momentum continued with sales up low double-digits this quarter over an exceptionally strong compare of up more than 50% last year. While we are watching macro developments and consumer behavior closely, our teams continue to successfully grow our brand desirability with domestic Chinese consumers. In addition, our ecosystem expansion remains disciplined as we largely focus on our six key city clusters. And finally, touching on our enablers, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. This quarter featured some incredible moments as we embed citizenship and sustainability in all we do. First, our ground breaking Artist and Residence collaboration with Navajo Designer, Naiomi Glasses recently won the Fast Company Innovation by Design Award in the Fashion and Beauty category. It was also recognized at the Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen. And we were proud to recently be named one of Forbes Best Employers for Diversity 2024, and on Parity.Org's 2024 ParityLIST, recognizing organizations that support equal advancement opportunities in the workplace. In closing, Ralph and I are encouraged by our team's solid start to this fiscal year as we continue to operate with agility. We are successfully marrying the magic of Ralph's original vision with a data-driven mindset to support and grow our iconic brand across new generation and geographies, shifting our business toward DTC and a more elevated wholesale presence, and leveraging our nimble global supply chain and culture of operational discipline in order to mitigate ongoing disruptions, drive greater long-term efficiency, and better serve our consumers. Entering the important fall holiday season, we remain on offense and in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments. With that, I'll hand it over to our new CFO, Justin, to walk us through the financials. And I'll join him at the end to answer your questions. Justin Picicci : Thanks, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. It's a privilege for me to step into the CFO role. And I am grateful for the support that Ralph, Patrice, Shin, and the Board have all showed me throughout this transition. I know I speak for the entire Ralph Lauren team when I say we remain firmly committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives, leveraging the power of our timeless brand, and strong momentum around the world. We had a solid start to fiscal '25 with first quarter top and bottom line results ahead of our expectations. This quarter's performance underscores the continued momentum and growing desirability of our brand as well as our multiple drivers of growth, which enabled us to deliver on our commitments even in a highly dynamic global operating environment. Our progress in Q1 also gives us confidence in reiterating the full-year outlook we introduced in May. Let's talk through our financial highlights. Which as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Total company first quarter revenue growth of 3% exceeded our guidance, led once again by our direct-to-consumer channels and international businesses. Total company retail comps grew 5% with balance growth across our brick-and-mortar and digital channels. Total digital ecosystem sales including our own sites and wholesale digital accounts, increased high single-digits. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 210 basis points to 70.9%. This strong performance was driven by favorable mix shifts towards our full price and international businesses, AUR growth, and lower cotton costs. AUR increased 6% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, and on top of a 15% increase last year. Our AUR growth continues to be driven by favorable product, category, channel, and geographic mix, along with reduced discounting, with minimal like-for-like pricing on moderating cost inflation. Adjusted operating expenses grew 4% to 56.1% of sales, up 60 basis points to last year. The increase was entirely driven by the planned timing of marketing investments, which represented 6.7% of sales, up 100 basis points to last year, supporting our New York City Fashion Show, Milan presentations, Polo Spring campaign, and other key activations globally. Excluding marketing, adjusted operating expense rate declined approximately 30 basis points to last year. We continue to expect full-year marketing at approximately 7% of sales. And our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 14.8%. Moving to segment performance, and starting with North America, first quarter revenue declined 4%, as continued momentum in retail was more than offset by planned declines in the wholesale channel. In North America retail, first quarter comps grew 1% in line with our expectations and including a negative impact of roughly 120 basis points from Easter shifting into Q4. Brick-and-mortar channel comps were up 3% led by our full price stores while digital comps declined 4%. We remain focused on improving the trajectory of our North America digital business as we move through fiscal '25, notably enhancing site experience and improving availability of top-selling core product. In North America wholesale, revenues decreased 13% as expected, reflecting significantly reduced sales of excess product into the off-price channel and receipt timing shifts previously discussed. Excluding the shifts, our full price sales declined roughly low single-digits, in line with our spring season-to-date sellout trends. Our AUR at wholesale increased modestly, consistent with recent trends, on well-positioned inventories in the channel. Looking ahead, we continue to expect North America wholesale declines to moderate through the remainder of fiscal '25, with sellout more closely aligning to sell-in, maintaining our ability to chase replenishment on stronger performing core product. Our outlook also includes the planned exit of approximately 45 department store doors this fiscal year, as we continue to proactively evaluate and refine our brand presence on a door-by-door basis. Moving to Europe, first quarter revenue increased 7%. This was ahead of our expectations, with both wholesale and retail sales outperforming our plan. All key markets delivered growth in the quarter, with the exception of the U.K., where retail growth was offset by continued softness in wholesale. Performance in Europe was led by retail, with comps up 8% to last year, including own digital commerce up low double-digits. AUR continued to grow strongly on top of last year's double-digit percentage increase driven by our brand elevation, with discount rates down significantly to last year, despite a competitive promotional environment. Europe wholesale increased 5% driven by strong reorder rates, notably at our digital partners following last year's channel reset. We continue to expect Europe wholesale channel growth in the low single-digit range for fiscal '25, with Q3 below the full-year trend due to the planned timing of shipments, as previously discussed. We remain encouraged by our brand's rising consumer perceptions in Europe, as well as our team's strong execution, especially given the ongoing dynamic operating environment across the region. Turning to Asia, revenue increased 9% with growth across all markets. Retail comps were also up 9%, on top of a 13% increase last year with strong growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased low double-digits on top of an especially strong reopening compare of up more than 50% last year. While our 618 holiday sales significantly outperformed the market, we continue to experience normalizing consumer trends post pandemic, as reflected in our reaffirmed outlook of low teens China growth this year. Sales in Japan, our largest market in the region, increased high single-digits supported by key marketing campaigns and a rebound in tourist spending which returned to pre-pandemic levels this quarter. Moving to the balance sheet, our strong balance sheet and cash flows continue to be key enablers of our Fortress Foundation, allowing us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We generated about $245 million in free cash, enabling returns of approximately $225 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases this quarter, even as we continue to make important long-term investments in our brand, technology, and ecosystems. Net inventory decreased 13% to last year, slightly better than our plan. Our inventory levels continue to be well positioned relative to our outlook for each region and heading into the important fall holiday season, with weeks of supply improving versus last year despite incremental shipment delays related to the Red Sea. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds, supply chain disruptions, and foreign currency volatility, among other considerations. For fiscal '25, we continue to expect constant currency revenues to increase low single-digits, centering on about 2% to 3%. Our outlook continues to include stronger growth in DTC and caution around the North America wholesale channel where demand is improving but still challenged. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 150 basis points driven primarily by Asian FX. Given the structural headwinds we've seen in the Japanese yen over the past few years, we'll be taking select like-for-like price increases in Japan this fiscal year. With regards to this year's revenue cadence, we still expect the first and third quarters to trend below our full-year outlook, largely based on the planned timing of wholesale receipts. The third quarter is also impacted by additional factors specific to this year, notably a shorter holiday selling window between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to last year and volatility around the U.S. presidential election and potential related impacts on consumer behavior. We continue to expect operating margin to expand about 100 to 120 basis points to a 13.5% to 13.7% range. In constant currency, relative to our fiscal '22 Investor Day base period, this keeps us on track to deliver our 15% operating margin target this year. We still expect gross margin to expand 50 to 100 basis points, driven by favorable mix shift towards our international and full price DTC businesses, continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting headwinds from incremental labor and other non-cotton raw material costs, and favorable cotton costs. We successfully renegotiated our annual freight contracts in the first quarter, encompassing the majority of our ocean freight requirements. Based on this visibility, our outlook continues to include minimal impact from freight in the first-half of fiscal '25, followed by incremental headwinds from higher spot rates, non-cotton material costs, and labor in the second-half of the year, as we called out in May. In addition, we are closely watching the risk of potential additional China tariffs along with the rest of the industry. We are well-positioned following several years of proactive diversification into other supply markets and development of near-shoring capabilities. Currently, China represents a high single-digit percentage of our finished goods coming into the U.S. And for Fiscal '25, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact our gross and operating margins by about 40 basis points. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be up low to mid single-digits in constant currency centered around 3% to 4%, led by our DTC channels. Wholesale is expected to improve sequentially from Q1 as North America sell-in more closely aligns to sell-out trends. Digital trends in Europe are expected to be pressured by the timing of an end-of-season sales shift into Q1. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately 160 basis points. We expect second quarter operating margin to expand approximately 80 to 120 basis points in constant currency, with roughly 110 to 130 basis points of gross margin expansion more than offsetting higher operating expenses due to the timing of key marketing campaigns this quarter, including the Summer Olympics and our September Fashion Show. We still expect marketing investments to grow at a faster rate in the first-half of the year, and decline in the second-half. Excluding marketing, we continue to expect second quarter operating expense to leverage slightly, similar to our Q1 trend. And foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margin by roughly 40 basis points and operating margin by 50 basis points in the second quarter. Based on favorable tax credits realized in the first quarter, we now expect our fiscal '25 tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the full-year, while the second quarter is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22%. In closing, Ralph's vision of inspiring the dream of a better life is as relevant today as it was over 50 years ago, resonating with our consumers around the world as well as our teams who proudly and passionately carry this vision forward, and continue to execute with agility and dedication. While we are mindful of ongoing volatility and challenges in the broader operating environment, our business continues to be supported by our powerful iconic brand and our multiple drivers of growth across geographies, categories, and channels. And importantly, we remain committed to delivering on year-three of our Next Great Chapter : Accelerate plan, while at the same time investing in our strategic priorities to create long-term value for our stakeholders. With that, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys, thanks for taking our questions here, and congrats on the nice quarter. One for Patrice, I guess, with the amount of volatility we're seeing in the marketplace here, especially in this last quarter from some of your peers that are reporting, any thought on why your consumer seems to be holding up relatively better than others in the market and do you think those trends are sustainable as you look ahead? And then I guess just to zero in on Europe for a minute, all the macro data points there, looks pretty cautious. I know you guys have made a big splash at the Olympics, but could you speak to where you're seeing some of the strongest and maybe the weaker trends in D2C comps, and it sounds like wholesale had outsized growth in the digital native retail channel with your largest partner. I'm curious how sustainable you think the wholesale trends are in Europe? Patrice Louvet : All right, good morning, Michael. Well, thanks for your double-barreled question. Let me start on the first part. Let me start by saying how exciting is the rolling thunder of the marketing activations at Ralph Lauren right now. Just to list a few of the activities that have happened over the past few months, April Fashion Show in New York, presence at Salone del Mobile, and our immense presentation in Milan, Wimbledon, the Summer Olympics obviously going on in Paris right now, then we've got the U.S. Open, then we have our show, then we have an entire program for the holiday season. So, exciting rolling thunder of activities right now, and I think it's really clear based on that, that Ralph Lauren is a powerful player, not just in fashion, but also in culture. And the consumer is responding around the world. Our net promoter scores, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, are up 400 basis points globally. Our online search grew 25% this last quarter, outpacing our entire competitive set. And this was even before the Olympics kicked in. So, of course, we're not immune to broader macro pressures on the consumer. And, listen, we're well aware of the heightened concerns coming into the markets this week. But from a fundamentals perspective, you can see that our core consumer is responding through these activations. And really, if you look at it beyond that, what else is working? Well, first, our lifestyle portfolio of timeless products, bolstered by our core, that really continues to resonate. And consumers are investing in quality, they're investing in authenticity, and at times of uncertainty and volatility, we know consumers will lean into brands they know and trust, and Ralph Lauren is at the very top of that list. Second, our elevated go-to-market strategy across key cities; China and Europe, and I'll come back to your question on Europe, are great examples of where we are running our play and bucking the market trends. And even within North America, which has been a little slower, we're encouraged to see how consistently strong our performance in our Ralph Lauren stores has been. And then third and most importantly, our teams are executing. They're executing consistently, and they're executing with incredible agility. So, you've heard me say this before, but as a company and as a team we remain on offense, operating with agility, and focused on what we can control while, of course, staying in tune with the ongoing volatility in the environment. We have a proven, diversified strategy that we've been executing over the past five to seven years, and we're going to continue to drive our brand desirability, and leverage our multiple drivers of growth to create long-term value. And actually, Justin, as your baptism of fire, why don't you take the Europe question? Justin Picicci : Fantastic, will do. So, we're encouraged by the consumer demand we see in Europe, and our sales grew quite nicely in Q1. We saw growth in all markets, ex the U.K., and a really strong DTC comp. We also saw the broader environment continue to be very promotional. But we did not participate in those promotions. In fact, we pared back our promotions and saw some really nice quality of sale gains in that market. On the wholesale side, our business increased on the back of really strong re-orders. Especially notable is our digital pure-plays, they really performed nicely in the quarter, and are coming of their second-half last year reset. And then taking a big step back, we do have a little bit of a tailwind from tourism, but domestic demand is really what drives our business in Europe. And we're seeing that really, really perform well. Patrice mentioned the macros, we're not immune to we're watching the U.K., we have their eye on Southern Europe. We know FX turns back into a headwind with the stronger dollar, and we know the Middle East and Red Sea situations persist. But we continue to forecast growth for the region and feel good about that outlook, cautiously optimistic in Europe. Patrice Louvet : And just to add, I'm really proud of the work our European teams are doing in a volatile context, whether that's how the brand is showing up. And having had the opportunity to see the brand in Paris recently and across European markets, we're showing up in an elevated engaging way. And the quality of execution and the touch points that we have, whether that's in our stores, online or with our whole partners, is absolutely fantastic. So, still cautious on the environment but really excited about the work that our teams are doing there. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Laurent Vasilescu : Well, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. Justin, it's nice to see that you maintain the full-year guide, especially in such a volatile environment right now. With Q1 coming in ahead of your outlook, can you talk about why you maintain the full-year guide? Is it just the continuation of broader caution that you called out back in May, or how confident are you that you can still deliver on this plan even if the consumer environment gets tougher from here? And then secondly, from a modeling standpoint, how should we think about North America wholesale for 2Q and the full-year on a year-over-year basis? Thank you. Justin Picicci : Thanks, Laurent. First off, I just want to say it's great to join Patrice and you all on today's live call. I've already had the good fortune to meet many of you in my former role. And I look forward to spending more time with you in the future. So, Laurent, to your question; yes, we were pleased we're able to maintain our full-year guide on both the top and bottom line, in line with our three-year commitments, and also consistent with our general approach to guidance at this point early in the fiscal, ahead of a all-important holiday season. And coming into the year, we assumed a status quo continuation of recent customer behavior and macro trends. And with today's report, we maintain that view. And that includes caution around the global macro and consumer backdrop, wholesale channel softness in North America, and also some incremental pressures from products costs largely in the second-half of our fiscal year. But taking a step back for a second, we've been building a durable strategy for a number of years. And Ralph's really built the ultimate timeless brand. And we're facing a potentially tougher consumer backdrop. We're going to continue to lean on our brand, our really strong brand that brings with it that clear value proposition that consumers know and trust. We're going to lean on our products. Consumers rely on them for quality and authenticity. We're going to lean on our diversification in both growth drivers and also our flexible supply chain. We're going to lean on our inventories that are well-positioned and we're going to focus on our productivity. And then we have our fortress balance sheet underlying it all, which we know is a key differentiator in the industry. So, looking ahead, this year and beyond, I'd say we feel good about how we're positioned, but we're going to continue to operate with agility and discipline in this environment which is quite dynamic. In terms of the wholesale trending question, we're encouraged by our proven wholesale seasonal sell-out trends in North America over the past few seasons. That said, our outlook remains cautious, in-channel demand still remains relatively soft and down modestly versus last year. In Q1 specifically, our North America wholesale, our revenue was pressured by a few factors. So first, we had some full-price shipment timing shifts that pressured Q1. We also had a pretty meaningful off-price reduction with our clean and well-positioned inventories. If you ex those items, our underlying full-price sell-in for the quarter was pretty in line with our spring seasonal sell-out trends, of that down low single digits. We always knew Q1 was going to be our most challenging quarter, for North America wholesale and for North America in total. And going forward, we do expect for sell-in to more closely align with that current sell-out, that down low single-digit range as we move through fiscal '25, so a stabilization. And this is going to start in the second quarter. And we also continue to keep our inventories really clean in that channel, and well positioned. We want to be able to chase in the demand if and when we see it, especially on the core. And we remain focused on really driving growth where we see the green shoots, right, where our strategy is, top doors, digital, we've had a really solid positive sell-out in Q1, and our upper-tier businesses, all areas where we're seeing traction. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Great, thank you. Next question, Angela? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. And congrats on a nice quarter. Patrice Louvet : Thanks, Matt. Matthew Boss : So, Patrice, with international outperformance across both Europe and Asia, I guess what inning do you see the brand's elevation strategy today on the international front or any changes in direct-to-consumer momentum that you've seen so far in the second quarter? And then Justin, just could you elaborate on drivers of the embedded SG&A leverage in the back-half of the year, and is the multiyear opportunity still to drive SG&A leverage? Patrice Louvet : So, thank you, Matt, for that question. I'm not sure that baseball analogies actually works for our elevation strategy because the game is never going to end. So, certainly, where we are in international is where our brand is most elevated. And you go to Shanghai, you go to London, or you go to Munich, you could see the way the brand shows up. And clearly, that's translating into strong performance. We're going to continue to consistently elevate our storytelling, our product offering, and our consumer experience, online and digital. I don't think that IT ever stops for the company. And if you look at the history of what Ralph has built over the past 57 years, I think that's been a through line that's driven all the activities and focus over that time. So, I expect us to continue to drive that. We're continuing to drive AUR, as even where we have the highest AURs in the world, in a market like China, for example, or Japan. And I have to say I'm really excited to see the momentum that we have that is so broad-based, right? Really strong Japan performance this past quarter, China still double digits in an environment that's complicated, Korea doing well, Australia doing well, and our key markets in Europe doing well, as you heard from Justin earlier. So, the elevation journey continues. The key for us as we do this is value perception, all right, is to make sure that as we elevate we're bringing the consumer along, and he and she consistently value -- sees competitive, attractive value in what we have to offer. And I think that underpins our multi-year AUR expansion. You can't just take pricing and assume the consumer will follow you. It's got to be done in the context of broad elevation. Extendedly, I think our priority right now, in addition to fueling that, is how do we drive the same level of elevation in North America? And the starting point was lower because of historical activities that was done many years back in terms of over distribution of the brand and probably over reliance on promotional activity. And so, we are working diligently to get to the same level in North America as we are around the world. And you see that play out in our full price stores here in North America with very strong comps again this quarter. And if you've had a chance to visit our stores around our key cities, you can really see the great work that our teams are doing to engage the consumer to provide a unique experience. Justin Picicci : So, Matt, on the SG&A outlook, so our fiscal '25 guide implies about 20 bps of SG&A leverage, weighted in the second-half, really due to a couple of factors, a little bit of the wholesale stabilization, but mostly timing of market. So, if you think about our marketing activations this fiscal year, in the first-half, we've got two fashion shows, we have the Olympics, a number of key major moments. Our marketing rates are going to be a bit higher. When you saw it in the first quarter, you'll see it again in the second quarter, a bit higher. And we're leveraging in the first quarter X marketing, we expect that trend to continue as well. But on a total SG&A trend, that marketing rate is going to come down in the second-half of the fiscal year. You're also going to see us start to scale some of the key investments we've been making in the past 12-24 months, including around talent and service and some of our DTC strategic growth investments. When it comes to the multi-year opportunity to drive leverage, I think as we've seen begin this fiscal year, we're expecting a more balanced contribution profitability between our gross profit expansion and our SG&A leverage. And I think we expect that to continue on beyond fiscal '25. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Thanks for taking my question. Justin, nice to see the seven-handle on gross margin, what are the remaining opportunities within product margin, do you still have room for higher AURs and lower markdowns? Is there a channel shift that you'll continue to benefit from? I think DTC could push 70% of revenue this year. So, anything to help us unpack, that would be helpful. Justin Picicci : Sure. So, John, I take a step back and I think about some really strong gross margin expansion, continued strong gross margin expansion in Q1, which continues to drive profitability and really reinforces the durability of our brand elevation strategy. And when we think about the drivers, many of them are durable and are going to continue on, right? So, we think about things like favorable product mix as we elevate our product, right? As we grow our hypo categories. All this is going to be a durable driver. We think about the favorable channel and geographic mix, right? As we shift or continue to expand DTC, you're going to see that benefit. And as we continue to outpace our growth in Asia, you're going to see that benefit in Europe, obviously helping us nicely as well. And then, when you take a step back, AUR, we're going to see AUR continue to grow on the backs of that product and marketing elevation. Less of a like-for-like price increase component as inflation moderates, but you're still going to see that solid, mid-single-digit AUR growth that you've seen this quarter and that we expect this year. And then, we had a couple of years of headwind there. We have seen that start to come through and we expect that to continue to come through as we move through this year, more weighted to the second-half. But then as we get to next year, we'll get the second tranche of that time cost recapture. And that's another sort of durable driver beyond this fiscal year. On the headwind side, I would just call out, this year, freight, we're ex-Red Sea, we feel like we're pretty well-positioned. We did a pretty good job in negotiating our annual contracts, but we do have some uncertainty there, largely in the second-half, depending on which way the spot rates go, and FX continues to be a bit of a drag. But taking a step back, we feel really well-positioned with our durable gross margin drivers in fiscal '25 and beyond. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Are you seeing any signs of increased price sensitivity of your customer, especially in North America, either in your value customer or your more premium customer? And as you head into the holiday season, what strategies are you implementing to engage the value-focused customer while maintaining the quality of sales gains that you've achieved at the brand? Thank you. Justin Picicci : Thanks for that. So, I guess when I think about the full-price performance, our full-price business is performing really, really well. Our core customer continues to be resilient, and we're seeing really good relative momentum in that business. Our brick-and-mortar comp growth continues to be led by our full-price Ralph Lauren stores. We're seeing strong gross margin expansion with strong quality of sales. We're seeing reductions in the off-price channel, which you saw come through in our wholesale numbers in North America. And our new consumer acquisition is bringing in higher-quality, less price-sensitive, higher-basket consumers. And we feel good about that business. I would say that from a value-oriented perspective, it's a subset of our consumers, smaller parts, still pressured given the current macroeconomics, but we have a playbook that we've established to convert this consumer. It's very tactical. It's targeted, compelling price value, product propositions, personalized communications, and we're seeing that connect. We're not immune to the macros, and we know they're still out there, so we're going to monitor the environment and react accordingly, but we're architecture that we've built up over the past few years to be able to continue to convert that subset of value-oriented consumers. And AUR in Q1, despite being in a really challenging environment, not only increased their total company, but increased across all of our regions. So, really pleased with the continued progress and the proof of concept in our brand elevation strategy. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Robert Drbul : Hi. Good morning. Just on the U.S. wholesale, North American wholesale, can you spend some more time just on, like the top 100 stores? I know you're closing some additional ones. Just sort of where do you think you are in the consolidation, of the U.S. wholesale with some of the additional closures that you had this year? Thanks. Patrice Louvet : Hey, Bob. Good morning. Well, we've been on a journey of elevating our wholesale presence pretty meaningfully over the past few years in North America. Wholesale has a strategic role to play in our go-to-market model, quality wholesale, really around brand discovery. So, while we are leaning more into DTC, and as that's the majority of our business now, and that share of our total business will continue to expand. We believe in quality wholesale. Key focus areas, indeed, are our top 100 doors, digital, where we're doing particularly well. And then, listen, we continue to prune those doors that we feel do not enable us to showcase the brand in the right way. We, I think, guided that this year we'll be shutting down 45 lower-tier doors this fiscal year. Last year, we shut down 20, right? The impact is going to be relatively minimal in terms of business impact. But I think the way the brand shows up in North America, that'll help us continue to drive the elevation. Going forward, I think if you asked me for a number, we'd say we probably closed 20 doors per season, 40 doors per year for a total of 150 door exits for the future, recognizing that we've shut down thousands of doors over the past few years. So, we've got a good, healthy foundation. We're going to continue to challenge it. And what's encouraging is when we look at recent share performance in those businesses, we're growing share. And while, as you heard from Justin, obviously, that segment, and as you guys, of course, know, that channel continues to be pressured, but we're growing share in that environment. And we're excited about that, and we want to continue to fuel that. And then, in the higher-tier wholesale, actually, we're seeing very strong growth rates. So, we're quite encouraged by that as well. Justin Picicci : And we continue to see quality of sales increase over the past couple of quarters in that channel, which also gives us a reason to believe that we've got the right growth trajectory in place in that channel. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Thank you so much. Patrice, can you talk a little bit more about the high potential categories, women's apparel, outerwear, handbags? I think you mentioned Jennifer Lawrence carrying the Polo ID bag. You mentioned they grew mid-single digits in the quarter, outpaced total company growth. Just talk about the progress you've made over the last 90 days and what your outlook is for the rest of the year for those high-potential categories? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Yes, we're excited about that business, Jay. So, thanks for your question. We're excited about it because we know the market, the total addressable market is quite meaningful across all three, women's apparel, outerwear, and handbags. We're excited because the consumer is telling us that our brand resonates in that space. And we're excited because our teams are building great capabilities in terms of both marketing, product offering, and go-to-market for us to be competitive there. So, if you kind of parse them out, women's apparel was the standout, right, continued momentum, double-digit growth on that business, AUR growth as well. So, we're continuing to elevate market share gain. And really, if you look at the drivers from a product standpoint, it's really foundational strategy and core, right? That's what's driving it, which makes it sustainable, right? This is not driven by fashion items, which may be hot today, but cold tomorrow. These are items that are core, that are timeless, that are authentic. So, think sweaters, think linen and polo shirts. We have very strong focus on iconic shirt dresses this quarter that's really resonating well for women. And if I go back to Matt's baseball analogy earlier, I think it does apply here. Women's were like in the second inning, all right, in terms of taking advantage of that option, because as historically, we've been more of a male-focused company. Outerwear is something we are really pleased with because we've seen strong performance and momentum in that category for many quarters and years now, with so much more to go. So, this season, we saw strength in our lightweight outerwear. I think canvas, city jacket, linen, windbreakers, denim, with outperformance across really every single channel, so, good foundation there. I think the key evolution, Jay, for us in this category is the realization that you need outerwear every single day of the year, not just in the fall or in the winter. And we have great propositions across the portfolio on that. And then, handbags is a category that's really important for us because if you look at the size of the market around the world and how fragmented that market is, it's a major opportunity for us. We are progressively building momentum in this space. The thing I would call out, and I'm glad you noticed Jennifer Lawrence wearing our yellow Polo ID handbag, among others, is the work that's been done on Polo. And what we're seeing is continued success on our foundational collections. Polo ID, different colors, different silhouettes, and you're going to see that continue to evolve. But I think we're really building an IP Bag with the Polo ID and we're seeing that resonate really around the world with great strengths in Asia, but also strong relevance here in the U.S. and across Europe. We're seeing our Lauren business also strengthen as we've elevated that proposition. Better quality design, better styling, better presentation of the product. And then, we've had some exciting innovation on collection with our RL888 bag that we continue to showcase and are seeing a good response to. We listen, we don't guide by category, but I think it's reasonable to assume that our high potential categories will consistently outperform the trend of the Polo company. And if you look at the size of the markets for each of these, we're talking tens of billions of dollars. So, even if we just capture a fraction of those markets that represent significant building blocks, not just for this 3-year phase that we started in September 2022, but really for the longer term potential of the company. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the progress. Patrice, as you think about the retail channel and full price versus outlet stores, how is the outlet store performance? What are you seeing there? And on the expansion of full price, you had some smaller footprints too. How are you thinking of the potential? And then just on the benefit of lower cotton prices, how much of a benefit is that to gross margin? How long does that continue and does it help offset any of the supply chain costs? Thank you. Patrice Louvet : Thanks, Dana. I think you're going to get an even better answer from Justin, so I want to turn it over to Justin. Justin Picicci : Hey, Dana. Thanks for the question. We're pleased with the solid brick-and-mortar comp we put up in Q1, growth across all of our three regions. I would say, Ralph Lauren's full price stores were a standout globally, continued strong performance across all of our regions, including in North America, and driven by traffic. And of course, we get a little bit of a tourism kiss, but again, domestic consumer momentum and also some pretty tough compares. On the outlet side, comps were stable, consistent with recent quarters, with AUR growth and conversion trends also stable. In North America, you did see a little bit of a sequential slowdown just due to the negative Easter timing shift into Q4, with underlying growth consistent with Q4. And our outlook, if you look beyond the quarter, reflects a continuation of those underlying organic trends, with the one call-out being once we get to Q3, we know we have a bit of pressure with the shorter holiday selling window versus the prior year. On cotton, so just kind of quick refresher, we expect about 175 basis points of benefit over the next two years, so, '25 and fiscal '26. We are still on track to recapture our cotton cost as planned in fiscal '25. We expect to recapture about half of the 175 bps this year. And it's going to be back weighted as I mentioned previously towards the second-half of the year, because that's the way it came on to our P&L. The same way it's coming off of our P&L in terms of timing. I mean that is reflected in our gross margin guidance about 50 to 100 basis points. And we did see a modest tailwind in Q1 from that cotton benefit. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Okay. We'll go to the last question, please, Angela. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Rick Patel of Raymond James. Rick Patel : Good morning, and congrats on the strong execution and squeezing me in here. I was hoping if you could provide an additional color on the outlook for D2C as we think about digital versus brick-and-mortar? With consumer behavior continuing to evolve, do you see the most opportunities off your brand and capture demand more towards one channel versus the other? And also, how do we think about the shape of growth for D2C this year given some of the work you are doing on North America digital and also activations you have planned for the year? A \u2013 Justin Picicci : Sure. Thanks for the question, Rick. I would say growing our digital business is a key priority for us. I mean it's a focused point of our global elevation strategy. You are seeing nice growth on a global basis in Q1 sort of international leading that growth. And, you are seeing nice growth. And, we expect that sort of balance DTC growth between our stores and our digital network to continue as we move through the year. So, continued momentum coming out of Q1. Our North America, specifically in Q1, our total digital ecosystem sales were up low single digits, right? And that was driven by solid sell-off performance in our digital wholesale channel where we are outpacing both last year and the competitive set and also our new Ralph Lauren Canada site that we launched last fall. Our owned North America digital comps were down a bit in the quarter 4%, off of softer traffic trends. And, we are -- we know we have opportunities here. And, we are focused on improving that growth trajectory this year and beyond. And, we put in place a number of interventions to get us there. We made talent investments in digital commerce and consumer technology, really geared towards enhancing that consumer experience. We are investing in site, speed. We are curating our offering, really focusing on more core and top selling products, making sure they are available and not out of stock. We are refining our personalized communications to customers to drive traffic and conversion, and full price new customer acquisition. And we continue to build and scale on the investments that we made and will continue to make like around search platform and the Canada site that I recently mentioned. We know we can win this space. We have seen what we can do and what we are doing in Europe and in Asia. We are going to leverage on those learnings as well. And based on that and the interventions put into place, we do expect our North America owned digital performance to improve going forward, notably in the second-half of this fiscal year. Patrice Louvet : Good. Well, listen, thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in November. And until then, take care, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
