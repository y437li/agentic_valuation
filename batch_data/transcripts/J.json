I'll briefly go over the financial highlights for the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Craig Martin, our CEO, for a review of the business and the quarter. Turning to Slide 4 in the presentation. As reported last night in the earnings release, we did end up the quarter with $0.71 on a diluted basis. This is obviously down from last quarter, as we told you last quarter. Typically the first quarter of our year does come down anywhere from 5% to 10%, just because of the seasonality of the holidays and some other factors. This quarter was obviously -- had a number of -- couple of other significant items in it. One was the closing of the SKM acquisition, which we talked about in the press release between the operations that we had for 2 weeks, which was probably the worst 2 weeks of the year from a holiday and vacation standpoint and operating standpoint for SKM, and also the closing cost and such that had to be put through the financial statements, they contributed about $0.10 net loss after tax. Going the other way, we did have favorable tax settlements in one of our foreign operations. This was the favorable tax to our court ruling and so that had about a positive $0.05 between the reversing of the tax accruals and also the interest accruals. So those do have opposite [ph] effects. But even beyond that, the typical calendar quarter ending in December with the holidays, vacations, some of the winter weather that impacts some of our field services activities, particularly around the Christmas holidays and such, had a negative impact. One other unusual item that we don't usually have in that quarter is we also had the government shutdown. And while that was not as big of an impact as it might have been because we were able to mitigate much of that impact, it still did have a negative impact on the quarter. So we talked about having an impact of about $0.10 to $0.15 in this first quarter. There were pluses and minuses in there. The SKM closing cost were a little bit higher than what we originally anticipated in that range. Some of the other things were the impacts of summer vacations. Having Christmas on Wednesday turned out to be even higher than usual impact because of, I guess, more and more people took the full week off because it's right in the middle of the week. And that also had impact on our billable hours as we saw more of our billable people also taking vacation than maybe normal. So while the results aren't something we'd like to see, we don't think they're indicative of certainly the whole year, and I think they are pretty much in line with what we've kind of anticipated going into the quarter. Backlog at the end of the year and in the end of the quarter was up to $18.1 billion, which is a nice growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Included in that is about $800 million of backlog that came in from the SKM acquisition. So even without that contribution, that onetime uplift, we saw a modest increase in the backlog. Our trailing 12 book-to-bills was 1.15. We continue to have a strong balance sheet, even with the $1.2 billion that we spent. In fact, our cash at the end of the quarter was just over $1 billion. Our debt obviously grew from last quarter. It was just over $1 billion as well. So our net cash was slightly negative, but actually during the quarter, we had pretty good cash flow because we spent between debt and cash. We spent over $1.2 billion to buy SKM, and our cash position actually improved when you take that out of the equation. We are maintaining our guidance at a range of $335 million to $390 million. That guidance includes SKM and all the activities that we had here in the first quarter. So we expect to be in that range, and that's the same guidance as we had going into the first quarter. Moving on to Slide 5. Just earnings history, we've changed this graph a little bit from what we've done in the past to show what the impact of our guidance is and where that would fall as we look at the whole year rather than just looking quarter-over-quarter. And still, we feel comfortable that we're moving back towards maintaining that growth rate and the plus or minus 15% compounded growth on our earnings. Moving on to Slide 6. Backlog as I said, nice growth year-over-year partially due to the addition of SKM, but overall, still trending up and heavily weighted towards professional services. Virtually all of the backlog that came in from SKM would be in the professional services category just because of the types of business they're in. And while we -- year-over-year our field services backlog was pretty flat, quarter-over-quarter was down a little bit, but that's probably more typical of the fourth quarter, calendar quarter, because the people are not making a lot of decisions around the holidays and such like that. So with that, I will turn it over to Craig to review the quarter. Craig L. Martin: Thank you, John, good morning, everyone. Now we'll start on Slide 7. You've seen this slide over and over again. Nothing about it has changed. I'll talk about the first 4 bullets in a little more detail. On the cost side, we continue to do a good job of controlling our costs, and our cost position remains at a nice advantage for us. Moving on to Slide 8. This is our relationship-based business model. We think this is an important aspect of the way we do business, and in fact, represents a significant difference for us from most of our competitors. We really do focus on long-term customer relationships and repeat business. We think by doing that, we can get repurchase loyalty, and that will drive steady earnings growth, good solid growth for us as a company. It's kind of a virtuous circle, when you think about it in terms of how it works. In the fourth quarter this year, our repeat business was 96%, so I think that's a good measure of what we're accomplishing in terms of making that relationship business model work. Moving on to Slide 9 now. This is sort of how the markets, sort of, it is how the trailing 12 [ph] of the markets looks. You can see that the process business -- share of our business grew just a little bit by about 1%. The public and institutional share declined by about that same percent. Industrial was roughly flat as the share of the business, but mining and minerals grew about 1%, and sort of all other category, power, pulp and paper, et cetera, that dropped about 1% over the previous quarter's results. Moving on now to Slide 10, we'll take a look at each of the individual market areas one by one. So starting with public institutional. We're considerably more upbeat about this market as we look forward than we were a year ago. I think we're doing extremely well as a company across this market in terms of our ability to win work and grow our market share. And we continue to believe that's going to be a positive for us. There's some good news in the market as well. We're starting to see movements in investments. Let me talk about each of those individually. Starting with the national government's business. It is clearly improving. Now that we have a budget that provides some funding certainty, that positions us very well. And the good news is that the money is going where we provide a lot of services. So we're very upbeat on our ability to continue to capture share there, grow our position in the markets, and now we have some stability on which to leverage that. So that's good news. We're also seeing a lot of activity in the U.S. military work, particularly around the Asia Pacific basin. We think there could be as much as $43 billion of new investment there, and that's a positive for us as well. Certainly our SKM acquisition will be a contributor to that. In fact, I'll talk a little bit more about SKM in a minute. We also see a lot of activity in the nuclear cleaning up part of the world. There's more than $1 billion worth of remediation projects here in North America. And of course, the nuclear cleanup in the U.K. is very robust. You might have noticed during the quarter we made a small acquisition in the U.K., a company called Stobbarts. That really helps us position for full EPC services to the nuclear industry in the U.K. So we think that's going to be a nice little addition, one of those niche acquisitions that we talk about a lot. Moving on to infrastructure. That is, in fact, becoming a strong market again. We see lots of prospects in all the geographies we serve. And on a real positive note for us from a legacy Jacobs perspective, both North America and the U.K. are strengthening. A lot of water projects out there, a lot of activity in Asia Pacific, and we see something on the order of $70 billion worth of infrastructure-related projects in the Middle East. So I think there's some real positives there. We also see tremendous opportunity in telecommunications and gas distribution business, another area we made some niche acquisitions, FMHC in the telecom business and MARMAC in the gas distribution business. Both of those are positives as we see it in terms of helping us leverage and grow that business. And then in the Buildings business, there are just a lot of good activity particularly in the technically complex buildings that we favor. So things like scientific facilities, laboratories, healthcare, all very strong. And then of course the high-tech market, data centers, control and operation centers and the like remains very strong. The outlook still is for about $80 billion in investment by the end of the decade. SKM's going to be a significant factor here. Obviously, they didn't contribute much in the 2 weeks around Christmas. But as we look forward, there's a very strong position there, a lot of recent wins in SKM's background. We expect the combination of Jacobs and SKM in this space will materially increase both our global leverage and our local market position across these industries. So a big plus for us as we go forward. You can see backlog is up a little bit quarter-over-quarter and up substantially year-over-year in this public and institutional space. Moving on now to Slide 11. This is our industrial sector. Let me talk about these markets individually. Pharma Bio is getting better. The product pipeline has some mixed results by company, but there is enough good new programs out there to drive investment, especially in the biotech world. That's a strength for Jacobs. We have both the knowhow and the geographic reach to serve our customers wherever in the world they need to make those investments. And increasingly, we're seeing those investments in places like India and Asia. You can see from the note there, an increase from something on the order of $16 billion to something on the order of $50 billion just in the next 5 years. Mining and minerals is growing. It's growing for us and the good news is, we think the industry is seeing the market come back a little bit. Commodity prices are firming. People's expectations about where commodities would go, particularly iron ore and gold, haven't come through. The copper supply situation remains a concern, and so we're starting to see people contemplating real projects again. And so the big projects business, it looks like it may be coming back, probably not a big factor in fiscal '14, but certainly could be a significant factor as we move into '15. What will be a factor in '14 for us, and we're doing quite well, is in this whole area of continuous presence. I told you last quarter about the wind at Calama in Chile. We are now leveraging that into a number of other relationships. And we think this business of being able to do all this small caps, sustaining cap work is going to be a very significant lever for us as we go forward. And then having the capability to provide all of the required infrastructure for our mining and minerals project, both the buildings and infrastructure capability, the materials handling capability and the minerals processing capability is huge. As a result of the SKM acquisition, Jacobs has become the dominant player in the mining and minerals industry in South America and in Australia. And I think it won't be long before we're the dominant player globally. So a real positive aspect of the acquisition. In the Pulp & Paper, power, high-tech, food and consumer markets, it's mixed. Of course, it's a mixed set of markets. There's a lot of alliance work for us. So that's going quite well. There's a fair amount of upgrade in facility kinds of improvements. We think the CapEx could be in the $5 billion range over the next 12 to 24 months, and we are managing to grow a share of the power market. Again, SKM's a real positive for us. It brings some real strengths in geothermal and hydro. So we think we're going to be able to see some leverage in our power business. It still is an area where we would like to be able to find an acquisition for greater growth, and I'll talk about that in a minute. Looking at the backlog numbers, up a bit quarter-over-quarter, mostly as a result of SKM, still down year-over-year. Part of that is just what's happened in the industry in terms of where the projects are. But a part of it's also is we move to more services rather than project events. We're going to see less revenue per dollar of margin, and so the impacts will tend to be lower revenues in backlog, even though we think margins will continue to grow. So that'll be a little bit deceptive until the big project part of the market comes back. Moving on now to Slide 12, the process industries. These are really strong markets today. The business grew, as I mentioned already, 1% share of our overall CapEx. We saw lots of activity in refining, oil and gas and chemicals. Particularly strong this quarter in chemicals, so the outlook is very positive. Look at the individual markets in refining, a lot of activity. The U.S. is likely to become an exporter of refined products. A lot of activity in Europe as a result of upgrades and trying to make those refineries more efficient. And then new CapEx, particularly in Asia and South America, is going to be a big factor. Brazil alone may have something on the order of $90 billion of refining investment. We announced the Guimar acquisition during the quarter. That's about 1,000 people in Brazil, and we think that gives us a very strong position to leverage our relationship with key customers in Brazil and grow that business. We don't want to forget Tier 3 gasoline. There's still something like 85 refineries that require upgrades for Tier 3 gasoline. I think that's going to be a program that spreads out over the next 2 or 3 years. Those projects are ideally suited for us. They tend to be in the $200 million plus or minus size. So that's a plus. Oil and gas, again very strong market. Global spending is up. Again, North American CapEx looks like it's going to be $100 billion. A lot of our key clients are the ones making the investments, so that's a plus. A lot of activity in gas monetization. And while that's not really our focus, it generates a lot of peripheral work. And all of that fits us very well. So we think that the oil and gas business is going to continue to be a strong area for us and an opportunity for us to drive increased growth. Brazil's also talking about becoming a major exporter, and that makes that EMR acquisition fairly key there as well. And then the chemical business, I mentioned already we had several significant awards under the quarter, none that we've been given permission to announce, but it was a good, strong quarter in the chemicals market. There is ongoing expansion pretty much everywhere in the U.S. regarding this. We heard a little bit about some project cancellations of some very big projects, but frankly, there's more work out there than the industry can do. And I anticipate, I think everybody does, that this is going to be a continuing strong growth area. And we continue to see lots of new FEED and pre-FEED work, and we're also starting to see now a few projects go into execute phase. So they are in fact, getting released so that we can do the work. The backlog story here, obviously, is quite good : 17% up year-over-year, 7% up quarter-over-quarter, 38% up over the past 2 years. So clearly, the strength in the process markets is one we've been able to take advantage of, and that's a real positive for us as we go forward. Moving on now to Slide 13, acquisitions. We've talked a lot about the SKM acquisition and its importance. We talked about Guimar. We also -- I mentioned briefly a couple of the niche acquisitions. I think niche acquisitions are going to continue to be important to us. There were several of them this quarter. I think we'll continue to see that. A couple like MARMAC and FMHC are in markets where we think there's going to be very significant growth, so very small acquisitions, we hope, will give us very strong leverage. In terms of looking forward, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to grow the business geographically. Asia Pacific still has lots of opportunity in it. South America has lots of opportunity in it. We also think we're going to work hard again, as we have for some time now, in both oil and gas and power markets, try to find the right kinds of acquisitions. If there are major acquisitions, that's where they're likely to come from. Moving now to Slide 14, this is kind of that commercial that I gave you at the end. We think that we have a great track record as a company. We've got a unique and powerful business model. We're very diversified across geographies, markets and services. We got a great balance sheet and a strong cash position. Our cost position gives us a good competitive advantage. And I think, importantly, the markets are going our way. So for some time now the process business has been strong. It continues to be strong, and we're winning good projects in that market. The public and institutional markets are rebounding nicely, and we see a lot of growth opportunity. And the industrial markets, mostly focused on pharmaceuticals and mining and minerals, are showing some good solid upward movement. In particular, mining and minerals looks like it's on its way back. I think that's a big positive for us in the industrial marketplace. So overall, I think it's a good story. We've got a great outlook and a great set of prospects going forward. With that, Laura, I'll turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : A couple of questions. John, just on the guidance, I understand the puts and takes of your first quarter. But to get to the midpoint of the range, it implies, I think, like, 18% EPS growth and the remaining -- if we look at the remaining 9 months of the year versus last year. So can you just help me with your comfort level that you could get to the midpoint? Is it more top line versus margin and any incremental details you can give us on just how accretive we should think of SKM in terms of accretion-related SKM now that the deal's closed? John W. Prosser: Looking forward to the next 3 quarters. Certainly, SKM is going to be a part of that. As we said in the press release, as we have been saying, it's going to be accretive. This first quarter is not indicative at all of anything about their operation. Part of that cost was based on the bunch of holidays and vacations and such. And the closing cost, which for the big part of it, are not indicative. The closing cost won't be continuing, and the operations we see as being nicely additive. They're all incorporated. I'm not going to give any specific cents per share and such, but I think, particularly as we look out to the third and fourth quarter, that'll be where the biggest part of the strength comes and -- that's more from our side, the legacy business just because we are seeing ramp-up. And as Frank mentioned, in all the process industries that we're having good sales in the government business, good prospects, the new budget that was passed is net positive, I think, for even the short term, as well as the long term. So I would say, as we always say, the midpoint of our guidance is where we have the biggest comfort. And from that, it's called bell curve as we go through either side. So I think we wouldn't have the midpoint where it was if we didn't think we were pretty confident that, that was the highest probability. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And I guess, I mean, last quarter when you first provided guidance, you said if there were 2 areas of the upside, I think you named government and SKM as one of them. It sounds like the government side, you're incrementally a little more positive on and SKM maybe more 2015 in terms of things turning. So just -- I want to make sure I heard that right. And then I guess, my question is just the field services book-to-bill was pretty disappointing. I mean you've had first quarters before where the field services book-to-bill has been like this, but I mean is that something to be concerned about? Do you think that turns positive next quarter? Craig L. Martin: Jamie, this is Craig. With respect to the field services thing, we continue to have a business where we are very flexible with our clients about whether we do contracts, sub-contracts and procurement on their paper or our paper. And that has a profound impact on backlog and an insignificant impact on gross margins. So for example, a couple of the 3 big bookings, big for us in terms of what we think their impact on gross margin will be that took place last quarter, we did not put any significant field services in the backlog because we don't yet know whose paper the contracts will be on. And so if we were to make -- if the customer and we were to make decisions to put it on our paper, these are sizable jobs, you can see hundreds of millions of procurement and construction go in the backlog. If we decide to put it on their paper, you'll see none, and yet our margin pull for those projects will be virtually identical. So it's going to be a little less predictable and a little more lumpy, I think, in terms of field services content, except where we do direct hire than has been in the past, okay? John W. Prosser: To your other question. We think the contribution from SKM is going to be -- starts now. I mean... Craig L. Martin: Yes. No. But I think she was talking more to mining and minerals side of things. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : In terms of the upside. John W. Prosser: I think, yes, the mining and minerals, just like ours, is a little bit longer term, but we are seeing positives there. The government, which we talked about possibly being a headway I think. Certainly we -- it looks like we've gotten over one of the cautions that we had, which was a budget, getting a budget and facing another shutdown right here in the first quarter. So yes, we had that hurdle out of the way, so that's got to be a positive. Certainly it's not a negative, so I guess that makes it a positive. We still have a couple of other things like debt ceilings and things like that, that could get into some impasses, but I think at least one negative is behind us on the government side. Operator : And our next question will be from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is Matt Rybak on for Jerry. My first question, just maybe walk us through how you're thinking about the current pace of bid activity on U.S. infrastructure projects and possibly quantify for us the opportunities you may pursue over the next 6 to 12 months. Craig L. Martin: Probably can't quantify it any meaningful way, but it's really clear that some of our traditional markets, so things that are funded by user fees. Rail would be a good example of that. Water and wastewater would be a good example of that. Now those markets are -- have been on their way back from some time now. I think we've told you the last couple of quarters that those were already positives and they continue to be. What we're seeing now though is with some certainty in the budgets, with some what I'd call tepid recovery in tax revenues at the state and local level, that road and bridge infrastructure is starting to move ahead. And so there's a lot of both the small project local activity, and that's a big business for us, as well as a fairly pretty significant number of big project opportunities both in North America and in the U.K. So those are, I think, very strong positives for the infrastructure business, transportation-infrastructure in particular, as we look forward, and that hasn't been the case up until recently. And then you add to that what we have with SKM, who are a dominant player in the infrastructure business in Asia, particularly strong in Australia, very strong water infrastructure capability, which we think both represents leverage for us in North America and the U.K. but also represents a significant growth opportunity in the U.K. as well. Now one of the reasons we're as positive as we are about the acquisition of SKM in spite of the general attitude that Australia is on a downer, is that SKM has done a terrific job of positioning for parts of the business in Australia, so they're going to continue to grow. And so our outlook, as you go across now, the whole infrastructure market globally is really -- is where that upbeat statement comes from, I guess, in that context, but I couldn't give you a list of specific opportunities that we think drive that. Again, we're not really driven by big events. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Sure. From a timing standpoint the big project opportunities in the U.S. that you just referenced, are those middle of the year, end of '14, or how do you think about those from a timing standpoint? Craig L. Martin: They're pretty well distributed quarter-by-quarter. So we'll see a few big events in this current quarter, we'll see a few more in the third quarter, and fourth quarter -- our fiscal quarters I'm talking about. There's a whole series of big jobs that just kind of are flowing into the industry and into competition and into selection, and we expect it more than our share. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then just to switch gears really quickly, you mentioned $800 million in backlog contribution from SKM. Can you maybe talk about how you're thinking about book-to-bill for that business over the next 6 to 12 months? Craig L. Martin: Yes, I think you will see -- because of the nature of the business having a high degree of consultancy, that book-to-bill will tend to be shorter in terms of the relative duration, and so book-to-bill will be in that 1.05 to 1.10 range. Operator : And next we have a question from Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Craig, I just want to clarify something on field services. Would you clarify -- would you say that the field service business is then accelerating and we just can't see it? And maybe you could talk specifically about the oil sands business because I worry about that business a little bit in terms of it still being kind of lethargic. Craig L. Martin: I don't know whether I would say accelerating because that would, I guess, have to be relative to my expectations for it. What we are seeing is projects get sanctioned both in the U.S. and in Canada. And those projects being sanctioned to move into the full scope of delivery, so detail design, procurement and construction. We're seeing that I think pretty much in line with what we've been saying about how good the markets are. So while you might characterize the oil sands as tepid, that's certainly not the way we see it. We wouldn't call it tepid at all. Maybe it's because we're winning more than our share. But overall, the projects are getting sanctioned. They are moving forward. The business of being careful about authorizations in terms of releases that push some of this work out, that's still out there. I think our customers in the oil sands, in particular, are going to continue to be cautious how much they authorize and how fast they do it. But I think that market's continued to move along pretty positively. George Kunberger, our head of sales, is here with me. George, do you want to comment? George A. Kunberger: Yes, Craig. I think relative to the oil sands, the amount of activity that we're seeing is not so much driven by big, major capacity expansion at the processing level, although there is certainly some of that. But there is a tremendous amount of effort and money starting to be spent on reducing the cost of capital and improving the efficiency of the oil sand collection and distribution and taking to SAGD facility. A lot of -- from, specifically in the form of well pads. A lot of our customers are looking to lower their overall cost, to begin with their capital investment, and more importantly, their [indiscernible] efficiency of how they operate those facilities. There's a lot of capital being put into that. Those don't necessarily get a lot of publicity as far as big fuel capacity expansion, but there's a lot of money being spent. The next thing, that whole concept, that approach will fall over into the design and construction of the SAGD facilities as well as far as standardization of design, getting standard specifications so we can go on a global procurement across various customers. So that's where all the efforts are being spent, and it is a lot of money, and that's where we're playing a big part of in '14 and probably in '15 as well. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Maybe if I could just shift gears and ask you about margin in a certain way. Like, when we look at the quarter, it is kind of noisy because of SKM. So maybe, Craig or John, you can talk about the salary multiplier and the overtime and billings and all these indicators that you usually look at. Is pricing getting better still? Is it marginally getting better? And do you see your margins snapping back to sort of where it was before the quarter, that high 5% range given the noise in SKM should die down? Craig L. Martin: Let me start now. I'll ask John to comment. If you look at the trend line for margins, it's clearly improving, slowly and steadily. What obscures that a little bit in quarters like this one is, as I think John mentioned, a lot of field services activity, maintenance activity, turnarounds, disappears between about mid-November and mid-March. And so last quarter and this coming quarter will tend to be -- will appear to be weaker because of that margin than the quarters where we have a lot of field activity. But if you look at the overall trend in unit margins, the trend remains positive and we continue to see a good steady improvement in the numbers. John, do you want to comment further? John W. Prosser: Yes, I think we're going to see, just because of kind of the turn that's going on and the transition into SKM and the impact of things like amortization of intangibles and such that it certainly has an impact on the net operating margins. The margins might trend a little bit lower than what we were having last year, but they're going to be in that probably in that range. A lot will depend on how contracts are taken in the field services. If we get a lot of [indiscernible] costs and such, that'll have a little bit more of a dampening effect. If we get a lot of these bigger projects, bigger activities that are going on and are more on the client's paper and so we're just managing them. And it's -- the more professional services, the margins will still be the same amount of dollars so that you'll see a little bit higher. But somewhere in that mid-15s, there's probably something running a little 7 [indiscernible] for the next -- this year. Operator : And the next question is from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : You talked about improving oil and gas segment, particularly gas monetization and some of the derivatives work. Can you talk about timing of some of those project as you see them? And also on -- if you could talk about your utilization rates currently as well as any comments on the level of competition and the current bidding environment. John W. Prosser: Sure. With respect to the gas monetization and all the derivatives work, we continue to get awards of pre-FEED and FEED work on an almost continuous basis. And as I said, we've had several big programs get authorized to go into detail design and to execute as we described it in the industry. There's a tremendous a backlog of opportunity still out there. We don't see any reduction in the planned spend of our customers. It's all just driven by how much can they get out and get started at a time. And to some extent, some of the pace here is governed by the customer's own availability of staff. But it's still very robust market and I think you'll see awards on a continuing basis, at least the kinds of projects that we're following every quarter as we go through the next couple of years. With respect to utilization, utilization is good. We continue to run it at historic utilization levels, so that's a positive for us. And I don't see any reason to think that there's any issue there. I think we are going to continue to see slight improvement in margins as a result of that. People are winning work and starting to load up, but I don't think it's at that point where it's going to be any dramatic increase. That's also very geographically dependent, so some parts of the world margins are still a prizefight, other parts of the world, not so much. So it's kind of a mixed bag on a global basis. Does that answer your question? Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : It does. John W. Prosser: I need to go back to clarify this thing that I said. When I said the mid-15s, I was talking about gross margins, and I was talking about operating margins. The operating margins will be in the mid-5% range. I just want to make sure because I kind of switched the nomenclature midstream without clarifying it. I figured I better clarify. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Maybe just to follow-up on that comment, John. I know there've been a couple of these questions already. But when you talk about the mid-5s, are you saying the rest of the year should be in the mid-5s, or is the full year should be in the mid-5s suggesting you're kind of exiting even closer to 6 and then you have a nice tailwind to '15? I just want to make sure we fully understand that. John W. Prosser: Well, I mean this first quarter was -- had a lot of negative impact from the closing cost and such like that. So I think the rest of the year will be in that range, and the total year will be close to it as well. Obviously the rest of the year will be a little bit higher than the total simply because it will be dragged down a little bit. But mid-5s, it could be 5.6 versus 5.4 or something like that. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And just on SKM, if you can, can you just provide a little granularity? So the $800 million that was contributed in the quarter, can you tell us how that trended specific to SKM quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year? And was that all industrial? Craig L. Martin: No, it was spread across all 3 of the market sectors, predominantly in the industrial and public and institutional sectors. A tiny bit went into the process side. The backlog is consistent with its historic levels, shows steady but not great growth. Remember Australia on the mining and minerals side has really struggled over the last year or so. But we see the backlog as -- for SKM as the positive for our outlook as we go forward, and there's nothing about that, that suggests we need to revise our thinking about its contribution in the next couple of years. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got it. And just 1 more. On depreciation, so that expense actually has come up I guess, meaningfully over the last 4, 5 quarters or so. Maybe you can just explain why that is and should we expect that trend to continue? I understand why amortization should be ticking up but why is depreciation coming up? John W. Prosser: If you looked at our capital spending over the last couple of years, it has been a little bit higher than trend. We've had a number of facilities that we've moved into larger facilities as we've grown and consolidated to get more efficiencies out of the existing facilities, so that's been a higher than normal trend. If you look at just going forward, obviously, there'll be some consolidations over the next couple of years as we look with the SKM offices where we're in similar places but we don't have a great number of leases that are coming up, particularly this year and even into '15, so you won't see that kind of activity. The other thing is we've had a little bit higher than trend line because we have invested as we've done some acquisitions with Aker and such, there's been more investments in IT services. When we typically have to upgrade, the IT within the organizations we bring in just sort of self-operate in our systems and have the level of capacity and such to run our systems and such but we've also been investing in some project controls and such to get better products there and integrate that globally. And over the next couple of years, that kind of spending will probably continue at that little bit elevated pace just because of the acquisition, the integration of SKM and the fact that we will be going through an upgrade on our ERP system and that there's a new generation of our Oracle system that will need to be implemented that will be a little bit higher cost in the -- or more capital cost over the next couple of years. So I think you'll see that the total number coming down from our capital spend because of the leases and such like that, but some pieces like some of the IT and technology spend will still be maybe a little bit above normal. And of course, the amortization cost will be up once -- when you see a full quarter of SKM with the amortization intangibles and such like that. But when we give guidance and are saying that SKM is going to be accretive over the balance of the year, that is net of all those kinds of costs, including integration costs and the amortization intangibles and the interest we're paying on the debt that we used so far. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Do you have an estimate today you could provide how much of additional amortization will you expect in Q2 through the rest of the year? John W. Prosser: Right now, our preliminary -- and we're still obviously -- there's a period you go through to look at this but it's going to be somewhere a little bit around $5 million a quarter. Operator : And then next question comes from Michael Dudas of Sterne Agee. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Craig, turning to your backlog chart, just maybe a conceptual question. As I look at the pie chart, where do you think over the next couple of years, which one of those single digit contributors to the backlog will become double digits over the next couple of years? And is it fair to say that the U.S., federal and the infrastructure portion of the whole company will decline as a percent because of these international infrastructure opportunities and other private sector opportunities as well? Craig L. Martin: Ask the second part of your question again, Mike. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : In that pie chart, the U.S. federal business and maybe the U.S.-oriented infrastructure businesses, would that shrink as a result of other areas growing, I guess, is my question. Craig L. Martin: Okay. Let me start first with -- I'll speculate with you on where we might see pies go to double-digit share. The 2, I think, have good chance of doing that are mining and minerals and the oil and gas. Both are sitting around 7% and 8%. I think mining and minerals, as we bring in revenues from SKM and as we continue to succeed in growing the business and getting this genuine [ph] presence kind of work should move over the next 12 months well up into the 10%, 11%, 12% revenue. The same with the oil and gas business. While it isn't showing up in terms of growth yet, we're doing a good job of taking position in the unconventional gas business and we've done well in the U.S. and we continue to leverage that globally. So that's another business that's plus or minus 7% today that I think could be a much more significant part of our revenue in a year or 2. But I think that answers your first part of your question, does it? Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Yes. Craig L. Martin: Second part of your question, I think what you'll see with respect to that whole part of the pie that is public institutional, that its relative share will stay about the same. And my reason for that is that while the U.S. part of it as a share will probably be a smaller percentage, we're picking up a fairly significant share of that market from SKM in all of Asia Pacific. We're seeing a rebound in the business in the U.S. and the U.K. and so overall, I don't think that the whole public institutional piece, buildings, infrastructure and national governments will shrink very much. I don't think it will grow very much either. With respect to the national government's part, we're picking up a stronger position in Australia and in the defense market and of course, I'm very upbeat about the expansion of our position in the nuclear industry in the U.K. So I don't -- again, I don't -- the U.S. share of that national government's market probably won't grow a lot, maybe a little bit but the overall national government's market will be stable or slightly growing. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : And is there a big difference or delta in operating income from those services, international versus U.S.? Craig L. Martin: Probably not beyond -- we might see it as a big difference. I doubt it. When you see it at the bottom line, it's a big difference, if you know what I'm saying. Because cost to serve and those things make a big difference as you go around the world. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : My second and follow-up, Craig, is I think you mentioned this either in the last call or in the meetings you had here in the East Coast late last year, 2014 from an acquisition standpoint, probably more of a digestive year even though you'll be active in maybe some of these niche opportunities. Is it likely that, that's the case or is there a chance we'd start to see more G&A, higher expenses because we're getting the bankers ready to make another major acquisition later this year for 2015? I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about that. Craig L. Martin: As I sit here today, there are a couple of things out there that are interesting. I don't know that they're bigger. I don't know that any of those are going to actually mature into an opportunity for us or anybody else. So I'd say that our expectation for the rest of this year is probably mostly niche acquisitions going forward and if there's -- and if we start to see things that have -- will have a bigger impact on the numbers or that are -- would have a big impact on the business, we'll signal that I think, pretty clearly before we get too close. Operator : And the next question is from John Rogers of D.A. Davidson. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : First, just in terms of the tax benefit that you saw in the quarter, was that all in the tax line or John, you mentioned some interest recovery, I'm just -- I mean, what does that imply for the tax rate for the rest of the year? John W. Prosser: Part of it was in the tax but the bigger part of it was actually in the interest because we've been accruing interest on the tax liabilities and this tax case that we got a favorable ruling on goes back to the mid-2000s, so it was like 2006, '07. So there's been -- the tax -- the interest that was accrued on it was much higher than actually the tax liability, just because of the rate. So in round numbers, I think it was about -- and this will all be in the Q but I think it was about 2.7% that was in the tax line and about 4.1% that hit the interest. And what's funny, because it's a reversal of interest expense, so interest expense is actually a benefit for the quarter. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : And then Craig, back to your original comments on gas monetization. In the past, you've talked about small LNG. Is that still a market opportunity for Jacobs and what are you seeing there? Craig L. Martin: We believe it is a market opportunity for Jacobs. We're involved in some high potential feed work in that area. Whether that will turn into real projects or not, I'm not that confident yet but I think, as I may have mentioned on a call before, because we're not seen as an LNG player, we're seen as somebody who could be innovative about small LNG and I think that gives us a really interesting position in that aspect of the market. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Okay, but it doesn't sound like anything material near term, I just want to clarify that. Craig L. Martin: I don't think we have anything in the short term that would have -- would be a big event. Operator : And next, we have a question from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : First question is bringing on [ph] Jacobs pre-SKM in a sense, if you look at the organic growth on the revenue side, even outside of SKM and I know the contribution was very little in the first quarter but you saw 10% roughly of revenue growth. So I guess, my question is Mr. Prosser pointed to second half seeing potentially stronger growth as some of the field services projects are released. Could we see revenue growth organically, pushing that sort of 10% to 15% range, would that be a possibility? John W. Prosser: We don't actually forecast revenues but typically, our first quarter revenues are down a little bit from the fourth quarter just because of the holidays and the activity level was down. If you look year-over-year, we're actually up about 8%, 9% in revenues on a quarterly basis. So I think we'll be adding in 3 quarters of a year for SKM, that will certainly add to the revenue. But even on an organic basis, we would expect to see growth. Whether it gets up to into double-digits by itself, that's hard to predict. A lot of it will depend, again, even on the field service activity, whether we are putting it through on our paper or on somebody else's paper. In which case, it could have some -- either way, it could have a material effect on the revenues and growth and such. But either way, it would have a positive impact on the margin dollars. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Second question is on SKM. I'm not sure if I missed this but did you folks gave an accretion amount on a GAAP basis now that you have all of the amortization numbers I assume, finalized? And that would be helpful. John W. Prosser: We have not and we aren't. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. That was a quick one for you guys. Third question is, just going back to the questions, I think, Mike Dudas and John Rogers have asked, so kind of melding them in a sense, if you look at power, I know there's some very nice technology companies there that are employee-owned and I assumed employee base is growing slightly older. Market's done well, could those be -- are those opportunities in terms of profile becoming more interesting for you from a, let's say, the next 2 to 3 years perspective? And on what John Rogers asked about small LNG, there seem to be some niche LNG technologies there that are being sold by small private companies even, could that be something you're looking to do or see [ph] leverage yourself into that market? Craig L. Martin: Let me go to the power business first. You're right, there are a number of nice sized, privately held firms who have good positions in the power industry and whose positions are very consistent with our relationship-based business model. And to your point, they are -- the ownership, the leadership is aging and that does usually create -- seeming [ph] opportunities for us. But remember that these acquisitions are always opportunistic, we have to have a willing seller, as well as a willing buyer. So we continue to stop by and visit those folks and make sure they know we're interested and that we would love to have them be a part of the future. And sooner or later, one of them will say yes but it's just impossible to predict when that might happen. With respect to the LNG side, most of what we see right now is not really a technology play in the sense of technologies for gasification. It's much more a play in terms of knowing how to modularize small facilities, small projects and being able to deal with the aspects that go with that. So I don't know that we'd be out looking for any small LNG technology companies. Again, we're really not trying to be in the technology supply business but much more in the honest broker engineering know-how side of the business. Operator : And then next question is from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So maybe John, you kind of alluded in some of your earlier comments about kind of the back half being better and I think you said at the time that there's probably some ramps maybe in the top line. How much of that back half ramp might also be caused by I guess, integration costs with SKM just -- that are happening right now in your second quarter and is that going to kind of keep the earnings growth kind of muted here in this quarter? John W. Prosser: No, the integration costs will be something that will be with us actually probably over the next 12 to 18 months, particularly in some of the systems development side and things like that. And so having a bunch of cost that would be in the second quarter falling off is not going to be what drives us; I think it's our historic business moving up. Now, there'll be a little bit of that but that's going to be ongoing and it's not all going to happen in the second quarter. Some of them, because we get into consolidation of space and things like that, might be 6 to 12 months or even further away. So I just have to -- because of the nature of our businesses, it's not like we're going to run out and fire a bunch of people or anything like that because what we bought were people. And so the idea is that the integration costs or margins, getting people onto our systems and getting them trained, getting -- looking at all the SKM systems and what are good lessons learned there that will be incorporated into our practices and things like that. So it's not going to be like it's a big bubble in the second quarter then drop off. Craig L. Martin: It will taper over time. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Sure, sure. I want to also dig in a little bit on EBITDA margins. We've kind of talked about EBIT margins. We have a little bit more insight on amortization but SKM was clearly a much higher margin business. I think it's been reported as kind of a mid-teens kind of EBITDA margin. Just from a mix effect, should have 10, 20, 30, maybe 40 basis points of kind of the EBITDA margin improvement. I guess, the question here is, one, would you say that, that's true? Is that kind of math the way thinking about the impact of SKM true? And maybe a more specific question, can you also give us the increase in depreciation so we have the full D&A contribution from the SKM deal? John W. Prosser: There'll be some of that disclosure in the Q and such. I'm not going to go through it line by line today. In fact, I'm not sure the depreciation number will be in the Q but the amortization number will but I think those will just check themselves out. There are no -- the numbers for depreciation are not material, so it's not going to be like it's out of line with what their revenue and operational contributions are. As for their margins, how they reported their margins were a little different than how we report margins. So when you look historically back to some of the information that was the public disclosures on them through the acquisition of what worth [ph] and things that have been on there, there were some things that we typically show as pass-through costs that they didn't include in revenue that would have had a -- doesn't change the margin numbers at all, just changes the percentages a little bit. So then when you throw in the amortization intangibles and things like that, which they didn't have and such, that brings them down. So their margins were not significantly different when we actually worked through them than ours on a kind of a same structure basis and so it's not like they're going to pull ours up or... Craig L. Martin: Or down. John W. Prosser: Or down. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So the numbers that were kind of talked about were what we'd call kind of a net revenue basis. So when you do look at the gross margin, it's much more similar? John W. Prosser: Yes. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Makes sense. And then Craig, just one kind of last question, you talked in November about the potential that you're kind of tracking $20 billion plus type projects. Can you just talk about the evolution of that? I know it hasn't been very long yet but is that list growing, shrinking, do you feel better about those odds? Can you just give us some commentary on the large projects that you're tracking today? Craig L. Martin: The list is growing. So there can be new additions to the list and we've had some unannounceable success in winning some of those. So the story is good, I just can't tell it to you. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So the stuff that you're winning right now is still feed on these larger projects, and is that a fair assumption and do you think [indiscernible] to follow? Craig L. Martin: Yes, but in some cases, the feeds are gigantic. Operator : And the next question is from Will Gabrielski of Stephens. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions. First, can you just talk about -- it sounds like you're booking less pass-through, which is why we're seeing field services backlog grow a little bit more slowly but in terms of revenue contribution, pass-through's a bit higher over the last 2 quarters than we saw over the prior year. So how do you see that trending in revenue over the next year or 18 months based on the bookings composition today versus what you're burning off? Is there a shift there or does it stay pretty static? Craig L. Martin: I think in the near term, you will see less pass-through being burned off because of some of the issues I just described and because an awful lot of the business that we're actually executing today is FEED and similar work. So part of what you're seeing in terms of backlog, we're booking less pass-through and we're working off historically booked pass-through, that's why backlog goes the direction in field service as it goes and I think you'll see that effect pass through revenue as you look out over the next few quarters. Did I say that right, John? John W. Prosser: Yes, and the other thing is that in this -- our first quarter, some of the things that get kind of moved around for the holidays tend to be maintenance turnaround activities they get -- and those don't have as much pass-through in them because that's more direct-hire in our own cost as opposed to big field construction where we might have some direct hires but we also do a lot of it through subcontractors and there's material and equipment that flow through there. And actually, some of the pass-throughs -- not all pass-throughs are field services, some of the pass-throughs actually are related to some of our government contracts and professional services, subcontractors that we have, particularly in some of our teaming arrangements and stuff like that on -- with the government and the public sector. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Two questions on North American refining. The first being there's been a lot of talk about the delayed and deferred maintenance over the past few years and just the refineries are still making a lot of money. Are we close to seeing any type of big maintenance cycle that could benefit you? And then the second question around the Tier 3 refinery standards, outside of yourself and the EPA last April, I can't find a lot of industry conversation about when those are coming and how real they are. Can you just give some color about the engagement you have today with the customers on those projects and when we can start to see that impact the business more materially? Craig L. Martin: Sure. In fact, I'm going to ask George Kunberger, our Head of Sales, to comment on that. George A. Kunberger: So on the Tier 3, what's been happening in the last 6 months, and this is way more technical than I can probably accurately explain, but in general, our clients have been able to buy and trade credits that manifest themselves in the form of extending the deadline for when they need to be compliant with the new law. So from the end of 2017 out a little bit, maybe even in some cases and it's different with each customer as far as even '19. And so as a result nationally, since to a large extent, these are non-ROI projects, then the clients are delaying those. But as a case by case thing, it's not a fraud issue. The second thing that you're seeing going on with the Tier 3 is naturally, if you're going to spend that kind of money to modify the refinery, they're going to see what they can do to also improve its efficiency and even its capacity. So you've got some reconfiguration and we're looking at these projects that will not only deal with the Tier 3 regulations but also what they can get out of that money they're going to spend, as far as improved profitability. But it's really -- so they are definitely being stretched out, that's for sure and that's why you haven't seen as much, probably, excitement about those particular projects in the last 3 -- last quarter as you did midpoint of last year. Craig L. Martin: The other aspect is that most of the folks you hear from, at least in our industry, are focused on big events. And these won't be big events, these are $100 million, $400 million, probably averaged about $200 million in size. And so I think even though it's very attractive work, most of our competitors aren't going to make a big noise about it because it isn't big project stuff, unless of course it's absolutely right at the center of our business. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Can I just push on that point before you get to my second -- the second part of my question? But just within that comment, I'm not necessarily referring to the competitors because CB&I actually did mention it last quarter. What I'm referring to more is that the refiners themselves who all hosted Analyst Days in December, I would've thought -- I mean, $16 billion over a short number of years for the North American refining industry is still a pretty decent spend for that industry. So I'm just wondering why they're not making a big deal out of it or if they're just sort of because they've been able to find some wiggle room, maybe as you're saying, that they'll just defer disclosing that until the last possible moment? Craig L. Martin: I think it's partly is we were -- I'm speculating here, I can't pretend to understand why oil companies say what they say. But I think that might be part of it. I think there is some belief that they're going to get some relaxation from the EPA on these standards and there's no money in it for them. And I don't know that if I were in that business, that I'd spent a lot of time telling you how much money I was going to have to spend to get no return. George A. Kunberger: Well, I think you do the math on what you just said, $15 billion divided by 85 refineries, you're still talking about a couple hundred thousand -- a couple hundred dollars, tops in over 2 or 3 years, so I think all of that plays if I were to agree with Craig. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And then sorry, just my second point on the maintenance season that's coming up, visibility there? Craig L. Martin: Yes. We see a lot of activity and maintenance. It has been improving steadily, frankly, since the big turndown in 2008, 2009. And I have every reason to think it's going to continue to do so. The summer, or spring and summer turnaround activity looks good to us as we sit here today. But of course, turnarounds can be deferred almost on a moment's notice, depending on what's happening in the industry in terms of capacity and production. So I think the outlook is good and getting better but it is a day by day business. Operator : And next question is from Robert Connors of Stifel, Nicolaus. Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Just real quick. With a couple of the ethylene crackers already awarded in the backlog, some of you may get a 4 Tier by the time we exit first half '14. Just wondering what your customers are saying about the timing of field construction awards of where you guys are going to participate some of the polyethylene and offsite and utility work. Craig L. Martin: A lot of the derivatives work is being completed as we speak. So I think we'll start to see pre-feed, feed signs of activities around those ethylene units over the next couple 3 [ph] quarters. The cycle for construction is in that 3 years, maybe a little more. So you can expect big field services activities, probably another 12, 18 months out. Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then also, you may have just answered this on a previous question, but wondering where you're best positioned, whether it be end market or geography to deliver your direct-hire capabilities, is that mostly on the maintenance side? Craig L. Martin: Well certainly, maintenance is a strong capability for us as a company and so the answer to that will always partly be yes. But I think the construction business, in terms of direct hire on the Gulf Coast is going to be another source of pretty significant activity for us, as well as the unconventional gas business onshore from Texas to North Dakota. So of course, Canada is also a big field services as one of my guys just pointed out. Another big field services aspect for us, we've just won some fairly significant work in that area, probably be a press release here in a week or 2. And we continue to see that as an ongoing growth opportunity, a lot of field services activity. George's comments about all these well pads is a pretty significant amount of business. Does that answer your question, Robert? Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Yes. And then, I guess if I could squeeze in 1 more sort of housekeeping. Over the summer obviously, we saw the Indian currency really de-value and you guys have one of the largest presence in engineering in India. Just wondering if you're seeing a little bit better competitive positioning and pricing environment there because of that? Craig L. Martin: For the most part, Indian engineering for these sort of work share projects globally are all priced in dollars. So the benefit's actually more to the margins than it is to the competitiveness. Operator : And the next question is from Stewart Scharf of S&P. Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research : Could you talk a little about the consolidation in the industry and just more of your long-term thoughts on foreign investments, for instance the Foster Wheeler deal and Shaw was acquired, just your thoughts on the competitive landscape regarding the increase in foreign acquisitions and overall [indiscernible]? Craig L. Martin: Well, I have believed for some time and I continue to believe that our industry needs to consolidate and it will continue to do so and I think we will see both small consolidations, a lot of the things Jacobs traditionally has done, midsized consolidations like the SKM deal for us and then I think there's still a potential for some fairly significant -- not sure of public companies but public company scale businesses to be acquired as well. Whether that money comes from combinations of U.S. businesses or some businesses, the European or Asian with U.S. businesses, I don't know that I can predict that. I don't think anybody found the Foster Wheeler thing particularly surprising, except at least maybe a little to me at least, the price. But I think that we're going to see more of that because I think there are more companies out there that don't have the market diversity or the geographic diversity they need to survive in the competitive marketplace in the future. Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research : And just on the SKM $0.10 charge in the quarter, how much of that is transaction cost? Could you break that out? John W. Prosser: We actually do break it out in the Q, which will be filed today or tomorrow, but the biggest part of that is the transaction costs. When you get in the amortization and things like that, it's probably 1/3, 2/3. Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research : 2/3 transaction? John W. Prosser: 2/3 transaction, 1/3 just the results of operations and the interest in amortization. Operator : And the next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I got on the call late so apologies if you've covered this already, but the 20 large projects that you've previously talked about, beyond the FEED aspects of them, do you think you could book some of the bigger EPC pieces of that this year? Craig L. Martin: Well, I don't know if you were on the call on for the discussion about whose paper we're going to be doing some of these big projects on. I think that we will see some of these big projects go in to execute in the next year. So in one sense, I'd say yes, in the other sense though, in terms of whose paper the procurement or construction activities might be on, there's a lot of uncertainty about that. We've got a couple of these big jobs that we've won already and the size of the booking is a bit very dependent on what the customer decides to do about whether it's on our paper or their paper. And of course, there is also the direct hire aspect to that, whether or not we do the construction. So I see some of those projects definitely going in to execute, I just can't tell you what the dollar impact on our backlog or revenue might be, though these other issues are sorted. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : But even if it's less on the backlog and revenues, you probably have a better earnings mix because of higher margins? Craig L. Martin: It will appear to be higher margins. In terms of absolute dollars, it will be about the same. The exceptions of that is when we do direct-hire construction and that carries an additional margin flow of its own. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then on cash flow, not sure if you talked about that but is there any reason to think that your free cash flow won't approximate net income this year or probably even be a little bit better than that, given additional amortization you might be incurring? John W. Prosser: I think that will be true and we've worked really hard on focusing on getting our receivable levels down. As they've grown here, particularly as the market got more pliant -- favorite [ph], some of those terms got stretched out and such so I think that as the markets starts turning a little bit more in our favor, particularly on some of these big jobs, then as we move into the field and to the procurement, we tend to get much better cash flow terms on those contracts than just on the pure professional services as we'll get the advance notice. At the past, the profit is at least a 0 balance funding so that you have much better receivable collections on that. So I think we should be pretty close to what has always been kind of our target and our expectation that our bottom line will turn into cash. So that cash, a lot of that will be used to continue to pay down debt or rather, small acquisitions and such like that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Rob Norfleet of BB&T Capital Markets. Robert F. Norfleet - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : In terms of the recent acquisitions you all announced, the FMHC, obviously giving you exposure to the wireless telecommunications market. Can you kind of talk a little bit about the opportunities you see to take market share in that market? And then I guess, over time, do you see yourself being a big player in this market either through obviously, additional acquisitions or just roll-offs?. Craig L. Martin: Yes, the markets are very interesting markets. There are a couple of decent size players, by that I mean, multi-hundred million kind of revenues. One public, one not public, when I think of the 2 biggest. I think there's plenty of room for another major player at that multi-hundred million, billion dollar plus kind of revenue club because the vast majority of work in that industry is still done by what I'll characterize as mom-and-pop operations. And there's a lot of inefficiency created by that. There's a lot of desire on the customer's part that have a 1 source kind of go-to operation. So in our outlook for that business, is very high. We're going to sign a key executive and exclusive with that business to see if we can't drive it faster rather than slower. I'm looking at him as I'm saying that. And we'll do that through or a combination of organic growth, some niche acquisitions and if we find the right one, some slightly larger acquisitions. Most of the businesses that are out there to acquire are going to be small, so they won't be a lot different than FMHC was, to maybe twice that size. So half that size to twice that size will be the typical acquisition, but there's a lot of opportunities to do that. So it's a combination of roll ups, maybe there's a big deal to do in organic growth but I think this is one of those places where we get very rapid growth. John W. Prosser: This is what, the third or fourth one that we've done in that space over the last couple of years, so it's not like this was something that we've been continuing to grow in and we see the opportunities to grow more. Robert F. Norfleet - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : And just secondly, John, just a quick question on working capital. Obviously, it tends to be lumpy throughout the year but what should we expect with SKM for the trend for working capital to be in 2014? John W. Prosser: Well, I think that as we get better on collecting receivables, our total working capital should come down a little bit but -- and we'll generate cash and we'll use that cash probably to -- most likely to pay down debt or for other acquisitions. So I don't see that working capital is an issue one way or the other. Craig L. Martin: I'd say that SKM historically did a good job of billing and collecting and I don't think there's any reason to think that will be in different going forward. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Craig Martin for any closing remarks. Craig L. Martin: I want to thank you all for dialing in and listening to our story. I hope we've answered your questions. If we haven't, I know you have Mr. Prosser's phone number and he'll be glad to spend the next couple of days talking to you. Have a great week. Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John Prosser, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration. John W. Prosser: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. I'll go over the financial highlights for the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Craig Martin, our CEO, to review our growth strategies and the business overview. If you go to Slide 4, as you'll see and as you saw in the earnings release, we had a disappointing second quarter. Reported earnings of $0.63 per share, $83.5 million for the quarter. These numbers reflect and includes a net of about $0.19 of unusual items, which I'll talk a little bit more in a minute. On a more positive note, the backlog at the end of the quarter went back up to a record high and it continues to grow and ended the quarter at $18.4 billion. So that's a good sign for the future. Good book-to-bill ratio for the trailing 12 at 1.13, continued to have a strong balance sheet. Our cash position was at just under $700 million, it was down a little bit from last quarter. It reflects about $110 million of paydown of our -- of the debt that we incurred with the SKM acquisition and also use of $65 million for a smaller acquisition that we closed during the quarter. We have revised our '14 guidance to a range of $3.15 to $3.55. This guidance excludes the impact of the unusual items I referenced above or earlier and also the similar items that we had in the first quarter. Just by way of clarification, if you recall, the first quarter, we had a net of about $0.05 of negative items, that was 10% -- or $0.10, excuse me, $0.10 charge related to closing costs and operations at SKM for the last couple of weeks of the first quarter. And it was offset by a tax benefit from a tax settlement in this quarter, the $0.19 that I referenced. So the guidance includes -- excuse me, excludes about $0.24 in the first half. Going to Slide 5. Looking at the unusual items. While the quarter was solid absent these unusual items, what were included was about $0.10 related to a number of projects in Europe that had adjustments and reserves that needed to be taken related to primarily project performance or risk terms. We had an unusual impact, a carryover from the Christmas holidays, New Year's holidays and also had a weather impact that was much higher than usual. This was primarily in the Midwest and Eastern part of the U.S. and up in Canada. It affected both the professional services activities because of office closures, people unable to get to work and also had an impact on field activities. And so it had an impact on our field revenues and also some of the field fees. SKM-related items were about $0.07 below what we'd anticipated. While SKM was accretive for the quarter, it added about $0.05 net because of unanticipated higher holidays and vacation levels and particular weakness in the Australian mining and minerals market, the results -- the resulting earnings were well below our expectations and that's, that $0.07 impact from SKM. On the positive side, we did sell some technology. It was a technology that we had some interest in that sold to a technology company and the gain on that was about $0.05. So the net of that was about a $0.19 impact on the first quarter. The second half results, as we look forward and while we haven't included it in the guidance, we do see the need to do some restructuring. Part of that is being driven by activity levels in Europe and the need to make some changes there; there's some other items and other parts that are by themselves small but when you add them up and look at them, they get to be a little bit larger. And also, with SKM-related acquisition, our integration cost and the opportunity we see to accelerate the integration and we see a lot of opportunities to get some -- improve the overall cost basis by moving a little quicker on our integration. There's going to be -- a little higher than maybe we originally anticipated, in fact, much higher than we originally anticipated in the integration and restructuring cost related to SKM. Offsetting that, the underlying business outlook remains solid as demonstrated by the record backlog. Just kind of recap a little bit on SKM. As I said earlier, it was accretive in the second quarter. The integration is moving along. We're seeing a lot of opportunities for synergies and actually, they're exceeding our expectations and that's causing us to want to accelerate some of the actions. Those actions will have a short-term impact on the remainder of 2014, but it will give us the solid foundation going into 2015. And so we think that the contribution from SKM could be even more positive than what we anticipated in the original acquisition. And also, we're seeing significant sales leverages, particularly in South America and Asia where we're seeing a lot of opportunities where the combination of their skills and our skills are giving us opportunities that just weren't available to either SKM or ourselves prior to the acquisition. As I said earlier, we had a strong backlog growth. It was up about 10% year-over-year. It was also up quarter-over-quarter. Field services were basically flat. You get the rounding, you'll see that it shows it's down a little bit but that's basically just rounding. So it's pretty flat year-over-year. And professional services did have a nice growth, around 14%. So that includes also the impact of SKM, but it's both the impact of SKM coming in, but also the strong growth in our underlying backlog. So with that, I will turn it over to Craig to go through some of the growth strategies and overview. Craig L. Martin: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We'll start on Slide 8, growth strategy. You've seen this slide largely before. I'm going to talk about the first 4 bullets in a little more detail later on. Our business relationship model continues to be a differentiator. We have good market diversity and I'll talk about how we're leveraging that. We have a good geographic presence as well. We've got a good solid cash position, both for acquisitions and to pay down our debt. And the bullet I won't talk more about after this slide is the last one, continue to drive down costs. The market remains price sensitive. We still are not seeing that point in the marketplace where price is not an issue and where we're starting to see margin expansion other than in a most minor way. So it's really important that we drive down our costs. In addition, we do see substantial synergies from SKM, and we think we want to act more quickly to obtain those synergies. So we're pushing hard to get those quicker and in greater magnitude as we look forward. We're also putting an intense focus on our operational efficiency. John has talked about the restructuring. That will also give us the opportunity to correct a couple of project performance issues that led to some of the problems that we talked about earlier. Moving on now to Slide 9. This is our relationship-based business model. You can see that it's pretty much what we've always described, what I think of as a virtuous circle of customer relationship development, good outcomes for the customer, which leads to more business with that customer. I'm pleased that again this quarter, our repeat business was over 96%. So we've had another strong quarter in terms of customer development, customer relationships and repurchase loyalty. Moving on now to Slide 10. You can see how the business breaks out by markets. This is pretty much the same as last quarter, so there's not a lot of movement in any of these numbers. And I'll talk about each one of these in more detail in the upcoming slides. So let's turn now to Slide 11, that's the slide titled Public and Institutional. Let me walk through these markets and give you a sense of what's going on. In the national governments market, things are definitely improving. The budget is providing some funding certainty, we're starting to see a lot of projects get released. There's money out there that's unspent at this point in the U.S. federal budget, and our customers are pushing hard to get it spent before the end of September. And that's a real positive for us. Major expansions in the Asia-Pacific area for U.S. military. It's one of the places where the synergies that we got with SKM are going to be a big benefit to us in terms of our ability to attack those markets and grow our business in Asia Pacific for the federal government. And on the U.K. side, U.K. defense remains very buoyant, and there are a number of major opportunities, probably more opportunities than we can chase to support the U.K. defense department at a very high level. Now we continue to see good business in the U.K. in nuclear cleanup. Recall that we acquired Stobbarts recently, a construction capability, added to our cleanup capability in the Sellafield area. There's $4 billion to be spent there on projects that we think Jacobs is in an excellent position to win. And we're starting to see another batch of spending in environmental remediation in the U.S. And so we think there's going to be some decent opportunities in that area as well. And then finally, we finally managed to penetrate the intelligence community through an acquisition. It's been a very difficult thing to break into the intelligence community, but we're now in a very outstanding position. And I think we'll see significant growth from the support of the intelligence committee based on our strong skills in that area. Moving on now to infrastructure. We've described that market as strong, it certainly is. You can see our comment on road, rail, airport opportunities are abundant, and particularly the U.S. and U.K. markets are very strong right now. So there's a lot of good activity there. We're seeing lots of activity in water projects globally, particularly in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. This is a strength that we got with the SKM acquisition. Jacobs had a small capability in water and wastewater prior to the acquisition. We're now one of the dominant players in the industry globally. So we think we're going to see a nice opportunity to continue to grow the business in water projects and we already made a couple of small announcements in that area since the SKM acquisition. In telecom, we see a lot of investment coming. There's just an enormous amount of activity there, and we're on track to see that become a $1 billion business for Jacobs. So I'm very excited about telecom, it's one of the areas we're going to continue to consider strategic niche investments. And then gas distribution, the whole pipeline safety area is another growth opportunity for us. We're doing a review of our prospects in that business already. We've already won 2 of the bigger programs. But there are many, many more programs of substantial size to be won, and it's going to play very well to Jacobs' strength in that regard. Moving on to the buildings business. This is a business for us, I remind you of every quarter, that's driven by business -- buildings with technical content. So for us, it's buildings where what's on the inside is more important on what's on the outside. High-tech's a big business, I'll talk about that more in a minute. Aviation, scientific, education, in particular secondary and tertiary education, health care, hospitals. In general, lots of activity for us in this area and areas where we have real strength. The fact that we are in a tech building differentiator for us is a positive across almost all the markets, and we think about things like the data centers, mission-critical facilities, that's a tremendous strength of Jacobs, probably the leader in the industry there. And we expect $30 billion of growth in that industry between now and the end of 2020. Again, the last 2 categories, both buildings and infrastructure, we've had tremendous impact from the SKM acquisition because it's been a significant add to our capability. We're doing a really good job of positioning and getting joint wins in that part of the business. The other good news to point here is the backlog growth. If you look at the backlog numbers, we have both good quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in backlog. I think that sort of goes against the general belief that these are weak markets. Whether they are or aren't globally, we're clearly in a position where we're growing our share and taking position in the public and institutional marketplace. Turning now to Slide 12. This is the industrial area that we talk about, kind of a mix of the stuff that doesn't conveniently fit anywhere else. Now let me start with pharmabio. That market is improving for us. The project pipeline still a little mixed, but it is driving capital investments. And we had a couple of announcements last quarter that I think are worth pointing out. We won, again, Facility of the Year for Novartis in 2013. I think that's our sixth or seventh Facility of the Year win in the pharmabio business. We were also awarded a developing countries modular program with Pfizer that I think will be -- turn out to be a very strong program over time. And probably more noteworthy than the press release would suggest on the surface. Our clients are investing a lot in India and Asia. You can see, we see significant growth in the India market. And frankly, our know-how, our ability to deliver things, like the Facility of the Year, and our geographic reach are key to win work with these customers, and we're very well positioned across the globe to continue to grow with the pharmabio customer. And then given our dominant position, our ability to do modular and that sort of thing, there's been some good news. Some of the mergers and acquisitions activity in the pharma industry looks like it's going to be a very strong plus for us. So we see there some significant opportunities that are going to be created by some of these recent merger acquisitions that should leverage up into a number of projects for Jacobs in the pharma space. Moving on to mining and minerals. Again, we say it's growing and that contravenes conventional wisdom. But for us, it continues to be a share game, and we believe we're continuing to grow our share in the marketplace. SKM's capabilities are very complementary to ours. And so we're seeing ourselves as better able to compete for projects around the globe. And the good news is on the big project side, there are now a few big projects in the proposal phase. Still in the study and FEED stage of those proposals but the prospects for major opportunities are better than they've been in the last few quarters. On the sustaining capital market, we've done very well. We talked already about the Calama win last quarter. But we're now seeing pretty substantial sustaining capital opportunities in the $500 million plus sort of scale. And we believe that's a real strength of Jacobs and that we'll be in a wonderful position to take advantage of those opportunities and should be able to win more than our share. As we've said all along, that sustaining capital part of the business has been an under-exploited part of the mining and minerals sector, and we intend to continue to take advantage of that in our growth. And then as I mentioned earlier, we do have a very clear full-spectrum service capability today that's moving us to be the dominant player in the mining, minerals industry in both Australia and in South America. Moving on now to the all other category, power, pulp and paper, high-tech, food and consumer products. It's kind of a mixed bag. There's good news and bad news in those markets, depending on which ones you look at. Some of the better markets right now, the food and consumer products, fast-moving consumer goods, FMCG they call it, is pretty strong for us. Those markets are becoming very India-centric. By that I mean that the customers want to center their development and their leadership of their programs in India and then leverage the rest of the world. Our position in India is relatively unique in that we're a full-service company in India, which positions us very well to take advantage of these international alliances that want an India-centric focus. A lot of money in CapEx in terms of industrial facility upgrades. We'll take advantage of that. And we are doing well in our limited position in the power market. A nice announcement for the EDF nuclear new build market last quarter puts us in a wonderful position to take advantage of nuclear new build in the U.K. We're seeing increasing demands for power work in the Middle East. And the SKM team brought us a very strong niche in the geothermal industry. So another positive for us. Overall, the backlog is flat quarter-over-quarter. And I think given the general perception of those markets, that shows we are doing a good job in sustaining our business there in spite of weak markets. Moving on now to Slide 13. This is the process part of our business. You can see backlog is up 16% year-over-year, I think that's a very good story. Starting with refining, there's a new area of focus on these reliability and safety projects. This comes under the general heading of ISA 84. It looks like the capital spend there will be $20 billion between -- over the next 5 to 7 years. It is largely a controls issue, which plays to one of our strengths, and it's very intense pro-services activity relative to big construction EPC projects. So we think that's going to be a real boost for our refining business as we go forward. Lots of CapEx being spent in the U.S., Middle East and Asia. The usual things that you hear about. Crude slate changes continue to be a factor as people swing from light sweet liquids to heavy sour crudes. A lot of general activity in terms of just creep [ph] upgrades in terms of refinery capacity. So it's generally been a good business, looks like it's going to stay a good business. There's also lots of potential activity in bigger programs in Asia and South America and certainly, in Brazil where they're predicting a huge investment. Our position there with our acquisition of Guimar puts us in an excellent spot. We've talked before about Tier 3 gasoline opportunities. Most of those have not yet been awarded, something like 60% of those opportunities are yet to go. Of the awards that have been made, we've won over 50% of the Tier 3 opportunity. So as we predicted, that's going to be a good business for us. Most of those are still in conceptual and FEED stage, so there's a lot of prospective opportunity. Oil and gas, it's a strong market globally, we talk about it a lot. I think the good news there is we had 2 very significant wins in the quarter that we've been able to announce. BP's Khazzan program, of which the first phase is $2 billion in Oman and the expected investment is $16 billion. Jacobs has won the contract there to support BP. And then here in the U.S., we won ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 program to support them in their onshore investments. Both of those are pretty significant, I think, in terms of our ability to continue to grow the oil and gas business for Jacobs. In the oil sands, we're seeing lots of focus on innovation and capital efficiencies. And we really have a strong offering there, both in terms of our gen-10 separate processing facility and modular delivery of the well pads. There's every reason to think that we're going to be able to continue to be the dominant player in the oil sands and continue to grow our business. Now everybody knows about gas monetization, there's a lot of activity there. The good news there is that there's some increasing opportunity for us. We're still not going to be a major player in the LNG game, but we are seeing opportunities to support LNG projects, opportunities to support the customer on the owners' engineering side and opportunities to do sort of balance the plant, offsite utilities, supply to the LNG facility itself. And then we see a lot of opportunity in pipeline services. We've made a significant acquisition there, as I think you know from last quarter, there's a ton of money going to be spent and we expect that, that will be an area where we'll be able to capitalize on it pretty significantly. And then chemicals is very strong. If you think back, at one time, this was 12% or 13% of revenues, today, it's 22%. The U.S. expansion in chemicals is enormous and a lot of that's driven obviously by the low-cost gas that's coming off the conventional-unconventional gas exploration and development. But the good news about that is in addition to ethylene, which is the big driver, there's a significant amount of derivatives business, and that's an area that plays very strongly to Jacobs' capability. And we continue to believe we're going to be able to be successful in executing a number of sizable derivatives projects based on this ethylene expansion. We got tons of projects in pre-FEED and FEED and lots of projects out there in front of us. The methanol business also looks to continue to be a strong business for us. And we're finally starting to see a very few jobs being released to execute or that we are being told to be released to execute in the next couple of quarters. That's a real positive for us because it means -- indicates that a big part of these jobs are moving forward and that's where the big impact on the P&L will come. So overall, the process business looks like a positive for us as we look forward. Turning now to Slide 14. We continue to have a strong acquisition pipeline. We are going to be very niche focused for a while, mostly concentrating on North America and on the upstream and telecommunications business, where we think there's a lot of leverage. The acquisitions that we have made recently, the Eagleton acquisition and the pipeline business, they were very synergistic day 1, terrific acquisition. We've been able to take a significant share of opportunities into the company that would not have otherwise been opportunities we could chase as part of expansions that supply to a number of our refinery companies, as well as some major compression and pipeline projects planned for Canada and the U.S. We also have announced the FNS acquisition, that's the intelligence-community related acquisition that I mentioned earlier, really important to us to be in that club. If we are successful, as I believe we will be with that acquisition, we'll be able to expand our presence in the intelligence community very significantly and we're really excited about the leverage that, that acquisition represents. As I said, our focus going forward is pretty niche oriented. We don't really have any major acquisitions in the plan for the foreseeable future. It's not to say something won't come along, but that's where we are at the moment. Turning now to Slide 15. We've had a history of solid growth. And we've got a good, strong relationship-based business model with 96% repeat business. We've got diversified markets, geographies and services, and fuels growth and limits exposure. It works for us. If you look at the public sector backlog growth, I think it's a clear indication of how we're able to leverage our diversification. We've got a good solid balance sheet to expand our business, both organically and through the right kinds of acquisitions. And when the times are such we don't need all that cash, we've got a debt reduction program that's working well for us as well. John mentioned that earlier. Our cost position continues to create a competitive advantage for us, and the restructuring and integration actions that we're talking about really are going to fuel 2015 growth. So I'm pretty excited about it. If I were to summarize, we certainly had a disappointing first half. That's behind us now and we are taking aggressive action to deal with that and position for the future, both through the restructuring, which will address and improve our cost posture and address the project performance issues, as well as driving SKM. SKM's -- the synergies are well above what our expectations were when we put this deal together, both cost synergies, in our opportunity to obtain savings, and market synergies, in terms of leveraging new business. So we're accelerating our actions to get those benefits even more quickly. When you couple the things we're doing in terms of taking action with 11 straight quarters of greater than 110% book-to-bill and record backlog, I think we have a very solid outlook going forward. I'm not happy with our first half, but I'm pleased with where we are as a business. And with that, Betty, we'll open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So, Craig, maybe you can give us some more color on the reserves and the projects you took in Europe and why do you think they're really one-time in nature? Can you elaborate on the restructuring you're going to do that really will make these projects one-time in nature going forward? Craig L. Martin: We can't elaborate very much on the projects. The projects are very likely to be, in fact, some are, in litigation. And to talk about them in any detail would expose what we believe our position is going forward. So I can't, unfortunately, give you a lot of detail. As you know, and any time we run the business, we're going to have ups and downs in projects. But the magnitude and the timing of these was just unusual and not typical of how we run the business. It happens from time to time. You've been around since 10 years ago and probably remember other times when that -- these sort of things happen to us; it's pretty rare, we intend to keep it pretty rare. But we got a couple of minor changes -- not so minor, but some minor changes we need to make in Europe to make sure that this doesn't recur and we're going to do that as part of the restructuring. I know that's not a real great answer, but it's probably the best I can give you, okay? Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes, yes. And I understand. I mean, were these fixed-price projects or were they cost reimbursable and the customer disagreed? Like any color there? Craig L. Martin: Well, I can give you a little bit of color but not much. The projects, for the most part, had features that are unusual for us and -- in terms of the liabilities we've signed up for or the way in which the cost-reimbursable part of the project works, and that's created part of the problem. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got it. And how significant is this restructuring, Craig? And what kind of benefits do you expect on it in 2015? Craig L. Martin: I'm not yet in a position to quantify the benefits in '15. We think that the restructuring charges will be on the order of magnitude of $0.40 in the coming 2 quarters. So it is a significant number. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then just shifting gears. Even excluding these unusual items, you did lower your full year guidance quite a bit. What really is going on here? Is that really just you started the year pretty slowly and revenues have been slow to pick up? Is it SKM really? Is that a big factor there? Maybe you can give us a little more color on what really happened. I mean, it's obvious that you started the year slowly, but anything else beyond that? Craig L. Martin: Well, I think the slow start of the year is certainly a factor. The timing of the SKM acquisition, just the dime that it cost us in the first quarter is a factor. And SKM continues to be a little bit of a factor going forward. As John pointed out, we're not yet realizing all the effects at the bottom line that we expected to get from SKM. On the other hand, we're pretty confident we will get those and in fairly short order. Part of what we've done is accelerate our restructuring and integration of SKM to capture that sooner. Normally in these situations, you don't ever hear us talk about restructuring charges for acquisitions because we're -- we take a very leisurely approach to doing that so as to make the -- as little pain as possible. Under the circumstances with the weak markets, particularly in the mining and minerals area, we're accelerating the integration that we would do anyway. And so it's going to pile up in 1 or 2 quarters. And that's a big driver. But it should give us late '14, '15 kind of timing where we'll see SKM at or even above our original expectation. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And I think it's right to say that it was a bit of a surprise to you that mining weakened in the quarter again, is that fair, at SKM? Craig L. Martin: I wouldn't say it weakened again, it has remained weak. We continue to see the outlook for mining and minerals as strong sort of fourth quarter of '14, fourth calendar quarter of '14 -- as stronger, maybe I shouldn't say strong yet. But the challenges have been pretty significant in Australia, and we're doing a good job of dealing with those. But one of things we've got to do to deal with them effectively and maximize our profitability is downsize our operations, particularly in the functional areas. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : First, Craig, just to clarify that problem project, that has now been completed? Craig L. Martin: It's in commissioning. So it's not quite done, but close enough. It's not just one project, understand. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. But in other words, you're not expecting any further cost impacts in subsequent quarters for those projects specifically? Craig L. Martin: No. We think we have a very good handle on where we are. Some of this is going to -- I'm confident will go to litigation. So the final outcome may not be known for several years. But we have a good strong position and I'm comfortable with our reserves. I don't expect -- as I said in my closing remarks, when I said this is behind us, I truly believe that's true. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, great. And then I know you mentioned restructuring actions are going to fuel fiscal '15 growth, but you're not ready to quantify the benefits yet. But I mean, if this is really just sort of an SG&A issue and your gross margins are kind of still on track and revenue and backlog are still okay, now that you have a more depressed 2014, I mean, is there any reason that we shouldn't be assuming that 2015 is going to be an accelerating growth year in terms of -- even better than your typical -- your targeted 15% growth? Craig L. Martin: Well, as John tells you, we don't give guidance for '15 just yet. But I'm very optimistic about what '15 looks like. Is that a backhanded way of answering your question? Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes. I mean, in our view, I mean, we don't see any reason why off a depressed year, it shouldn't be a very accelerated year if it's really restructuring within your control. But I guess, we'll see how that plays out. But I guess I'm just kind of wondering how we should think about cash generation and usage over the next few quarters? I guess with the stock under some pressure here, might it make sense to authorize a buyback? John W. Prosser: We will continue to utilize and monitor our cash very closely. We'll look at the long-term uses of cash depending on what the stock does. As we've said before, we always monitor that and have discussions at both management and board level, anticipating where -- how we should use that cash. But we have great uses of cash, just with paying down the debt and getting us in a better position that we generated from SKM. And there are still, while we're not focusing on large acquisitions, but there are still a number of niche acquisitions in a couple of markets that are very interesting that we also want to advantage of. And we think those are at prices that are favorable uses of our cash as well. So we'll continue to monitor that. And depending on the circumstances make what we feel is the right allocation of the capital. Craig L. Martin: We continue to look at sources and uses of cash with the board on a frequent basis. And obviously, we're going to be alert to doing the right thing with the cash at the right time. Operator : Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I guess my main question is as Jacobs is clearly exceptional at integrating, and it seems like our expectations about SKM are now perhaps a little more driven by a more sort of accelerated integration. I guess, just looking back in terms of how much you paid for SKM and how comfortable you feel around that versus what you see today. Are there some lessons in terms of the due diligence that you feel you've learned through the process, and we should assume those have been applied to your smaller but more recent acquisitions? Craig L. Martin: Well, with respect to the SKM acquisition, first of all, if there's -- everything we see about it, when we look at the numbers, even where we are today, it's going to be a very good deal for the shareholders. So I have no lack of confidence in that situation at all. If I have criticisms of the way in which we handled the acquisition, we knew the mining and minerals market was weak, we knew it would have an impact. I think we could have been more aggressive about obtaining the synergies and doing the integration than we were and that's not normal for us. But I think in this particular case, we probably should have taken a harder look at it, maybe gotten after it a bit quicker, but we're going to remedy that this next quarter. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Got it, okay. And a second follow-up question, Craig, is really on your end markets. You seem to be pretty bullish incrementally on the midstream side and we see that in the recent acquisitions you've made. As you look at the petrochem side, as you said, projects seem to have been slower to roll out. But we're hearing positive commentary when we've -- at least in this earnings season. So any incremental color you can provide, and I know you already have in terms of some of those field services activities and the timing, as you see it today. Craig L. Martin: I think -- my view and our view of the petrochemicals business is pretty consistent with what we told you at the end of the first quarter. It's a good, strong, robust market that customers are being very conservative about releasing projects. But I think the optimism that you're hearing from others is probably mirrored by our own. And my point in my prepared remarks about the fact that we're actually starting to see some of these projects go to the execute phase, detailed design and construction, is an indication that things are starting to unblock or open up, and we're going to start -- well, not start to, I think we'll continue to see projects going to execute, and that will be a positive for us and obviously others in the industry who have that kind of work in the FEED stage today. So yes, I think the market is finally starting to open up and release the bigger parts of the programs, I think that will be a positive for us and the other competitors in the industry. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Sterne Agee. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : For John or Craig, so if I look at the guidance today versus 6 months ago and given the commentary you've made and the answer to some of the questions, would the vast majority of it would be the integration, surprise issues relative to SKM? John W. Prosser: Looking at the guidance, we're really excluding some of those impacts. Certainly going forward, the lower rate of earnings that we saw this last quarter are affecting the second half. But we'll get to those and get that straightened out. I think some of the other items that Craig's kind of alluded to, things have been a little slower getting started. So as far as some of the awards in the petrochemical area and other areas, the softness in the market in Australia that affected SKM. I think that also the pricing, the margins at 6 months ago, even 3 months ago, we felt we saw a little bit better improvement in margins and this market has stayed more competitive longer than what we would have anticipated. And so all that, that's probably dampening our short-term outlook a little bit as well. So I think -- and also, if you look at our guidance, which we've revised, but I always talk about midpoints and such, but you guys have gotten out ahead of us by a fair amount as well. So I think that you're a little more optimistic than we were even in our last guidance. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : You mean me specifically, John, or everyone, are you being general [ph]? Craig L. Martin: He's picking on you, Mike. Don't kid yourself. John W. Prosser: You asked the question. You're the one that's on the phone. That was a general comment. When the Street's $0.08 to $0.10 above our midpoint, that seems to be a little bit high. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : And theoretically, the midpoint would still be in the original guidance range that you put out 6 months ago, so I get that. John W. Prosser: That's a probability. Yes, it is there. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : For Craig. So again, to finish up my -- the thoughts on SKM. When you said the expectation for the integration and the opportunities are greater today than you'd thought 6 months ago. And I know you won't quantify it, but is there an order of magnitude that you can show or provide us that level of comfort? Is it because of the markets you're serving they're going to get better? Or that the cost structure, combined with the margin pickup, is going to really drive a lot more returns and earnings growth from this acquisition in 2015. Craig L. Martin: I think it's a little bit of 2 different factors, Mike. First off, we are starting to see big projects in the mining business, we are starting to see our strategy to do sustaining capital pick up. And I think we're going to see improvements in mining and minerals business, a big chunk of which is SKM-related that are going to drive improvement. The other thing I see is very significant opportunities to reduce structural costs and that's not unusual. We often see that in acquisitions, particularly in industries like infrastructure where SKM's very big. We usually honestly take a fairly leisurely approach to getting those savings. And our view here is that the timing is such, we could go -- we should just go ahead and get them in a much more aggressive way and get that bottom line impact sooner. So it's the combination, I think, that's the positive as we go forward. And that combination I think is going to be what's got the real positive impact for '15. Did I answer your question? Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Yes. I think that's fair. And I'll just ask one final follow-up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, on the pipeline opportunities, what kind of share do you think you have now? Is it a very competitive market out there for you? And on these large programs [ph] that are coming up for bid, are you -- do you have the manpower and capabilities to gather an inordinate amount of share of that type of business? Because it seems like it's going to be a very large opportunity in the next few years in the U.S. and North America. Craig L. Martin: Well, I think our share today is, gosh, low-single digits, maybe less, if you can imagine that. It's a big market and we're still not a big player. But I think our opportunity to leverage up and to take share there is very significant. The impact of acquisitions like MARMAC and Eagleton are pretty significant on our credibility with those customers. And in some ways, it's not different than the comments I made earlier about the intelligence community. Pipeliners see themselves as a club and if you're not a pipeliner, you're not in the club. And so we went out and became a pipeliner by acquisition. And I think the leverage that, that represents is huge. We've seen the Eagleton acquisition grow by 10%, 12% in 3 months, just on the back of us being able to leverage them into 2 projects. So I think the outlook's very positive there, it's a huge market. And I believe we'll -- that's another place where I'm looking to have a $1 billion business in the not-too-distant future. I'm looking at the guy who runs it right across the table from me at the moment and he's nodding his head yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Can you actually maybe just touch on the market and pricing dynamics that you've seen so far? I mean some of the larger ones that are coming to market seems like the terms in the U.S. anyway are, I guess, a bit more hybrid in nature, people taking on more risk. But how are the pricing that you're seeing for the projects you are pursuing? Craig L. Martin: We are seeing the clients try to push more risk on to their suppliers. So that's a battle we're fighting constantly. So far, it's a battle we're winning but it is a battle we have to fight every time we look at one of these projects. And that's partly an indication that the market is just not yet truly as strong as any of us would like it to be. So margins are running faintly better quarter-by-quarter, but by that I mean very faintly, we're talking about 0.1 basis point or less kind of growth in a quarter. So it's -- excuse me, it's not a robust market yet by any means. It's not dirt cheap like it was after the bust in 2008, but it's pretty skinny. And so I -- and I think that's going to continue till more of these projects get released into detailed design and execute. Because the demand for a capability, when you're in execute is 4x what it is when you're in FEED. I think that's a very significant difference in terms of the supply of capability on the Gulf Coast. And then, of course, as we move into construction, construction and labor issues will become very significant and that's another factor that will ameliorate this terms issue because willingness of our competitors to take risks that we won't take will go down rapidly when there's no people to do the work. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And I apologize if you touched on this at all, but just as far as government work and the transition to MATOC type of, I guess, competition structures, maybe just talk about the dynamics with the overall market in general and the spending that you're seeing and your ability to take share and what is the value proposition you are offering to get that share, which I assume you're doing? Craig L. Martin: Well, our share growth is actually quite good. I actually had some data, I don't have it in front of me today, that looked at our share growth in DOD and NASA, those 2 federal markets combined, over the last 10 years and we have sharply increasing growth. We more than doubled that business. And if you look at some of the major players who had significantly more share than we did, say a Lockheed Martin or a Northrop Grumman, their shares have gone dramatically the other way. So we clearly are taking share. But we're doing that on the basis of a really spectacular track record of sustained superior performance. So when our customers in that business look at our past performance, they see a really strong, almost unblemished past performance record. And then we manage to be very cost competitive. And in a MATOC world, the advantages of those 2 combinations are really difficult to beat. When we have both the best price and the best technical offering, we win. And so our share on the MATOC side has been good. Where we've had single award contracts converted to MATOC, we have lost some share. But where others have had single award contracts converted to MATOC, we've gained more share than we've lost on our single award contracts. So the net effect has been an opportunity to grow market share, and our team has been very successful in doing that. I'm very proud of them. Operator : And our next question is from Luke Folta of Jefferies. Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess, first question I had was -- I'm interested in what you've got planned for the outlook on the telecom space. I know you said you want to get to $1 billion in revenues in that business at some point. Can you give us some sense of following the acquisitions that you've made recently, kind of where we are in terms of the size of that business? And also, it seems like there's just a massive amount of growth in that business on the what they call small cell or distributed antenna system side of the market where we're seeing a bit of shift in spending into those buckets. Do you currently have leverage to that aspect of the business? Craig L. Martin: We do. We have a, I would characterize a modest gas offering as we sit here today, and we continue to expand that offering. There are a number of small players around the North American geography, the U.S. geography, who have good skills but no reach and we're rolling those up steadily now into a business. I expect that we'll start -- we'll be in the $300 million class fairly soon, I mean like maybe by the end of the year. Although, I'm not -- don't quote me on that. And I think we'll see that $1 billion growth pretty fast thereafter. It's clearly a market where the customer is crying for additional capability. And capability with global or -- not global, but U.S.-wide reach. Yes? Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Is it fair to assume that margins in that business are dramatically better than what you're seeing in most other markets? Because some of the comps out there were -- it seems like there's -- some of the margins there are into the 20s on an EBIT basis. Craig L. Martin: I think it depends on the aspect of the service that you're looking at. If you're talking about things like tower climbing and the work of direct installation, the margins are certainly better than our field services work generally, but they're certainly not at the 20% level. If you look at engineering services, network analysis, those kinds of things, they command a very nice premium compared to the more, I hate to say it, run-of-the-mill engineering services. Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Any sense of what the split is in Jacobs in terms of field versus professional services in telecom? Craig L. Martin: Right now, we're probably about 50/50, give or take. Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just on the Tier 3 regulations, really nice win rate there, it seems. 50%, you said. Can you -- you said 60% or so what the projects that you think will come to market have been -- haven't come yet, implying that you've won -- or that 40% has. Can you give us some sense of what you've won so far? Just trying to get a sense of what the scale is and what's still available out there. Craig L. Martin: Well, these projects, the programs individually run from $50 million to $200 million in terms of capital cost. So just to use a hypothetical number, let's say, that 20 projects have been awarded and we won 12, which is about the right ratio. They'll range in size from, I'd say, $50 million to $200 million, maybe in a few cases, $300 million. So probably you're looking on an average there of -- well, let's use an average of $100 million just to keep it simple. So that's $1 billion worth of work. Unfortunately, I've got no customer who's let me announce that work yet. So I'm not able to give a lot more detail. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just a couple of questions. Sorry to belabor on the issues in the quarter. But I guess, Craig, one thing, I mean, you talked about the restructuring actions that you're going to take that should yield benefits. Your backlog's been growing. As we look to 2015 with the organic growth that you're seeing and the growth for some of the acquisitions, plus the restructuring, do we get to a point where you should finally achieve, I would hope, beyond 15% sort of EPS growth because we continue to push that off every 3 to 6 months. And then my second question is the issues really seem to be that you're having focus internationally whereas historically, Jacobs has been more of a North American-centric type company. I mean, does it make you think just doing business internationally is just a little more challenging? So when we think of Jacobs as being a more sort of derisking C company, I mean, we should just expect a little more volatility or more of these hiccups relative to what we've seen with Jacobs over the past 15 years? Craig L. Martin: Let me answer the second question first. I really don't think you should expect more volatility. I think that we are continuing to contract on a basis that is consistent with our principles and that quarter in and quarter out, we ought to be pretty predictable as a company. I will say though as projects that we do get bigger, the chances of having an individual project that outcome is material does go up. So it's not a perfectly linear level of volatility going forward. Does that make sense? Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes, I guess so. Craig L. Martin: If you have a bad big project, it doesn't get offset by a whole bunch of other good projects, right? Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. You just don't usually hear Jacobs having bad projects. Craig L. Martin: Well, and we don't usually have them. But I don't want to ignore the possibility that we could have a big job that didn't go well, and therefore, have an upset, and I don't want to have told you, well, that can't happen because it could happen. But I don't think it's very likely. I think the volatility that you've seen historically is the volatility you're likely to see going forward. Okay. Going back to the earnings growth outlook. Like I said earlier, we're not ready yet to give FY '15 guidance, but I am very optimistic about '15. I think we've got a real opportunity to do particularly well. And obviously, in my mind, that's not ordinary growth. So I guess, another indirect way of answering your question. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. We've belabored the point. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Wittmann of Robert Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : John, I just wanted to clarify. In the commentary, you mentioned that SKM related is going to affect the second half, yet in the guidance, it seems like you're excluding some of the one-time items. How should we think about that? I just want to be clear that the SKM negative effects from restructuring whatever else, are in fact added back. So if that's the case, what are -- how does that affect the second half? Is it just cash and then we're adding it back on the adjusted EPS level? Or how should we think about that? John W. Prosser: Well, what we're focusing on in the guidance on the second half is specifically these restructuring charges, both related to SKM and other parts of the business are not included in the guidance. My comment was that SKM is not operating at the level that we thought they would this year. That probably will -- that has impacted our guidance going forward, but that's included in our guidance. The operating side of SKM is included in our guidance at a lower level than what was in the original, earlier guidance. But the restructuring and integration costs still are outside the guidance that we provided. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it, that's helpful. Just thoughts on the problem contract. Was that a contract that you recently acquired yourselves into through either Aker or SKM or one of the more recent large acquisitions or is this something that's kind of was part of Jacobs the whole time? Craig L. Martin: That's a question I can't answer because it would be too revealing to the customers involved. John W. Prosser: And just to be clear, this wasn't just 1 or 2 contracts, it was about a half a dozen contracts that impacted us at various levels. There were 1 or 2 that were more significant than the others. In that charge, there's more than just a couple of contracts. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got you. Craig, in the past, you've talked about the $1 billion plus large opportunities. I think, John, in the spring, you started talking that to be, first, you said kind of 20-ish and then you said maybe more than 20. Craig, just update there on large project gestation, if you would, and the likelihood for you to get your share or more than your share even this fiscal year? Craig L. Martin: The large project gestation continues to be a positive. I looked at a list yesterday in our sales review that must have had 25 projects on it. And these were all the sort of the big ones. And our win ratios continue to be good in that regard. So I'm certainly very positive about where we are. I don't know that we'll win 57% of the big projects. I think that would be unrealistic for us. But I do think our win ratios will be pretty significant and more than adequate to fuel the growth that we're talking about. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. Maybe one final question here is just on the gross margins, they actually reported pretty well despite some of the other challenges. Is that mix benefit from SKM or something else? How do you explain that the gross margins were actually pretty strong? Craig L. Martin: We do get a mix benefit from SKM. Their unit margins are higher than industry averages. Offsetting that, their unit costs are higher than industry averages as well. So the opportunity is to keep the margins up and the -- get costs down, and I think we'll be able to do that. Operator : And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I just wanted to clarify a comment you made on mining. You said project activity is starting to improve. I'm curious whether you're seeing that in any particular part of the -- in any particular region and also whether it's any particular commodity type where you're seeing more activity. Craig L. Martin: Sure. Regionally, it's South America and Asia, not Australia, and -- although there's one fairly big program in Australia, I think we're going to see. And then it's almost all copper. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. I mean do you have any insight as to whether you're starting to see impact of that in 2014 or it's most likely 2015? Craig L. Martin: I think the big impact is all 2015 and beyond because it will -- there's FEED and study work that will be pretty substantial first. Were you able to hear that? Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. You guys highlighted U.S. infrastructure opportunities as a strong end market for you going forward. I was just wondering if you could possibly quantify the opportunities you're pursuing over the next 12 months and touch on whether or not you're seeing any award delays ahead of the September highway bill deadline. Craig L. Martin: I probably can't quantify any specific details. It is an improving market for 3 reasons : more activity on project finance, design build, TTPs, better focus on local tax revenues, particularly sales tax, to support expansions and, of course, we do have a highways bill, for the moment at least. So all those things are positives for the market and we are seeing some decent growth. We're also, because of our positioning, I think we're taking a little market share and so that's a positive for us as well. So I'm optimistic. I think the federal gyrations are less and less critical to the infrastructure market because of what the states and more importantly, the local communities are doing to deal with their infrastructure issues. People are just getting tired of waiting on the feds for money. And so we are seeing a fair amount of activity that's sort of independent of federal funding. And I think that will tend to continue. The backlog is enormous. I saw a study from I think it was McKinsey just the other day, and their argument is there's a $57 trillion investment in infrastructure globally that has to be made between now and 2035, I think that was the date. I mean $57 trillion, that's a really big number. So I remain very positive about our infrastructure business, and I'm seeing us start to get growing share of that market. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And when you talk about share gains, is that on any specific type of project? Or are you aggregating roads and bridges and projects of that nature together? Craig L. Martin: Well, the places we're probably doing the best in terms of taking share are rail and water and wastewater. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. Got it. And then to switch gears just a little bit. You highlighted on the first call that you were seeing some project delays in the North America refining side. And I was just wondering if you could provide us with an update as to how those projects are moving along? Craig L. Martin: The refining projects continue to progress. Again, I think it's a little bit of the same outlook we've described across the whole hydrocarbons industry in the U.S. where customers are reluctant to go into execute phase till they're very confident of the outcome and the competitive situation, in terms of what's going to -- what's the availability of supply. But I think things like Tier 3 gasoline and ISA 84 in the refining business, are going to drive people to invest. And because that's a calendar-based issue in terms of having to deliver on those investments rather than one that's market based, I think those projects will move forward fairly crisply, but maybe not quite as fast as we'd like. Tier 3 in particular, I think I mentioned this last quarter, a number of our customers have been able to buy their way around the Tier 3 rules in the short term. But in the long term, they won't be able to do that, and that will push them to make the investment. Did that answer your question, Matt? Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's perfect. Operator : And we've reached the end of our Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Craig Martin, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. Craig L. Martin: I want to thank all of you for taking the time to talk with us. It's been a tough quarter and a tough first half. But I really do believe it's behind us. I think we're doing the right things to get the business going in a very positive direction. I think we have a terrific story in terms of backlog growth and our positioning in the marketplace. And I think if you stick with us, you'll be very, very happy with the outcomes as we go forward. With that, thank you all. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Jacobs Engineering Fiscal Year 2014 Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Michelle Jones, Vice President of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Michelle Jones : Thank you. Statements included in this webcast that are not based on historical facts are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on management's current estimates and expectations and our currently available competitive financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not put undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 27, 2013, and in particular, the discussions contained in and Item, 1 Business; Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as company's other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements that are discussed on this webcast. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John Prosser, EVP of Finance and Accounting. John W. Prosser: Thank you, Michelle. I'll go over the financial highlights for the quarter, then I'll turn it over to Craig Martin, our CEO, to review the quarter in more detail and the operations and the outlook. Turning to Slide 4, the financial highlights. As I'm sure many of you saw in the press release that was put out last night that the earnings per share for the quarter was $0.49. That included the impact of restructuring of $0.35 that we had talked about last quarter. I'll get a little more detail on that as we -- as I go through the points. Backlog ended at $18.5 billion, up a little from last quarter, but also up nicely from a year ago. Continue to have good book-to-bill. Balance sheet still is in very good condition. Our cash has increased by about $80 million, up to $772 million. Net debt decreased. And we continue to have a strong balance sheet. We have continued our Q2 guidance, so I think as we look at that, we expect that excluding the impact of the first half adjustments and the second half restructuring, that it'll be near the midpoint to slightly below it as we look at it now. Restructuring, as I said, for the quarter was $0.35. We now are looking at a total restructuring cost of somewhere between $0.55 and $0.60 for the third and fourth quarter. This is up slightly from what we had talked about last quarter. Part of that is attributed to, just as we've got into the detail, the gross cost has gone up by about 20%, but the bigger impact was the fact that we are not getting tax benefit for all the expenses currently, so the tax benefit is about half of what we had anticipated when we were talking about a number in the range of $0.40 last quarter. But we will get this all complete in the fourth quarter, and I think the results of the benefits from that will be clear as we go forward. Turning to Slide 5, which is the backlog. A nice increase year-over-year, up slightly quarter-over-quarter. I think this continues to show we do continue to see good prospects in the pipeline and that the market activity continues to be strong. With that, I will now turn it over to Craig Martin to go through growth strategies and review the quarter. Craig L. Martin: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I want to take just a minute, as I always do, to talk about our growth strategy. It doesn't change, so it's going to be the same one you've heard before. But we're going to continue to focus on our relationship-based business model. We think we put -- that puts us in a unique position in the marketplace. We're going to continue to leverage that diversity in markets and geographies that we've developed, and expand that geographic presence, as well as focusing on some niche growth in existing geographies, using this multi-domestic strategy. I think, again, it's somewhat uniquely Jacobs. We're going to continue to use cash for acquisitions to contribute to our growth, and we're going to continue to work to drive down costs. I'm going to talk more about the first 4 items later, but I wanted to take a little bit more time here. The market continues to be very price sensitive. We are not finding any areas in the market where the conditions are such that we can get significant improvements in price, and we are finding areas where price pressures are still pretty high. So we're focused very aggressively on keeping our costs down, driving our costs down so that we're in a good position to win work as we go forward. This restructuring that John talked about, I think that's very good positioning for us from a cost point of view as we look into fiscal '15 and beyond. Moving on now to our next slide, this is Slide 7, our relationship model. Again, we've talked about this relationship-based business model a lot. You can start almost anywhere on this chart and understand how our business model works. We try to develop long-term relationships with our customers, and that builds on trust and client knowledge, which produces better results and superior value. The customers then have high repurchase loyalty and that comes back to us through steady earnings growth and our ability to reinvest in the business. The measure of that repurchase royalty, at least one of them, is our repeat business. In the third quarter this year, our repeat business was 96.5%, which I think is close to a record level, and pretty consistent with the last 2 quarters. So clearly, we are being able to build those customer relationships that endure. Moving on now to Slide 8. You can see how the overall business breaks down. I'll talk about each of the segments of that in a little more detail in a moment, starting with the public and institutional segment or sector, whatever you want to call it. Let me start with that, so turning now to Slide 9. This is the public and institutional parts of our business. Really, 3 major categories there : national governments, infrastructure and buildings. Let me take a minute to talk about each one. On the national government side, we're seeing a steady flow of opportunities in the U.S. And this FNS acquisition that we closed on the 1st of July is already starting to drive significant opportunity in the national security aspects of our business, something we wanted to be in for a very long time and now have the credentials to grow pretty rapidly, I hope, in dealing with the key sort of black aspects of our government operations. We still see good opportunities in the U.K. and Australian defense and major opportunities with the U.S. Department of Defense in the Asia Pacific. Particularly in the Asia Pacific aspect, our SKM acquisition is a huge plus. It positions us very well to take advantage of the investments in Asia and across the Pacific. We also see lots of business in the nuclear cleanup area, both in terms of the remediation projects in the U.S., nearly 1 billion of those and then of course, that nuclear cleanup in the U.K., which is one I've told you in the past is sort of behind where we are in the U.S., lots of opportunity there. We have 2 major prospects that we expect to see action in the next couple quarters. Our Stobbarts acquisition from earlier, certainly helping us to position for those prospect. We feel very good about our chances. Just in the near term, we see that as about a $4-billion market. Moving onto infrastructure in the telecoms side. It's a very large business. Over the next 5 years, something like $2 trillion in spend globally. A big chunk of that here in the U.S., probably north of 20%. We are very well-positioned to continue to grow in that business. We're getting really good traction. We continue to see a nice flow of small acquisitions to support that as well, and that will be one of the areas of our focus. I'll talk about that when I talk about acquisition. So it is a good business for us. We're seeing a lot of activity in water projects globally, particularly U.K., Asia Pacific, Middle East. It's a $70-billion market, and we were fortunate to be able to announce our United Utilities win in the U.K., a major win in the water business for us and positions us for very long-term activity in water in the U.K. And there's still tremendous opportunity in airports, roads, rail. We continue to gain market share. The overall investment there is very, very significant, and we see every opportunity to continue to grow. On the building side, our buildings business is getting steadily better. As you know, we repositioned the business to deal with the downturn in the federal contract environment. It looks like federal business will be coming back. We're seeing it come off a pretty significant weakness with some strength. We're seeing high-tech is a particularly strong aspect of the business, both mission-critical and data-related activities. And again, SKM has brought us a very strong position in both infrastructure and buildings to leverage across the globe. When you look at this business, the backlog is up again. I think that's a really good story in what people perceive to be a difficult market, and we had a pretty nice surge in government contract -- federal government work in quarter 4 of last year. There's evidence that we're going to see a similar surge this year as our customers try to spend what they have budgeted. So overall, public institutional looks like a decent market for us as we look forward. Moving on now to the -- what we call the industrial markets, I'm on Slide 10. Let me start with pharmabio. We have a terrific skill set. We remain one of the leading players in the industry with full integrated EPCM capability, lots of know-how in Lean project delivery that is somewhat unique. We think we're going to be able to continue to leverage that. The product pipeline is picking up. In fact, I would characterize this industry has gone from somewhat blah to somewhat boom. We've identified more than $2 billion in new starts in a form of either new starts or new retrofits, so we think the near-term look for this business is much improved from where it was. We see good investment in India and Asia. We've talked about the Indian domestic market and its expected growth. And then, of course, animal health and consumer products are closely related businesses. Some of our key customers that made acquisitions in that area that we think will also drive some growth for us. Moving on now to mining and minerals. It is a depressed market, overall, but we see lots of opportunity for us to continue to grow. In particular, that relates to sustaining capital work and asset optimization. It's a big area of spend for our customers trying to get more out of what they've got, as opposed to building new. And I think that plays very well to our strengths in the small-cap and sustaining-cap marketplace. We are seeing a few big projects but it is still relatively few big jobs out there to win. Moving on now sort of to the other category, pulp and paper, power, high-tech, food and consumer products, kind of a mixed bag. We're seeing some activity in power, both in the U.K. and in Europe, as well as some activity in the Middle East. We continue to have very strong niche in the world of geothermal power. Alliances are also picking up as we move to consumer products, particularly strong for us because most of these alliances with international food and consumer products players are India-centric, and we have a terrific position to support those customers since we've been in that India position with those customers -- selected customers in the industry for a very long time. And now there's a fair amount of activity expected in the industrial facilities area in the U.S. and we think that'll be a positive for us as well. Overall backlog is flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, so I think that's not surprising given the weakness of the mining and minerals market in terms of big projects. Moving on now to the process business, that's on Slide 11. Refining oil and gas, chemicals, pretty much the heavy hydrocarbons business. Refining remains a very good market for us. There's lots of investment in the U.S., in the Middle East, in Asia, in South America. Our acquisitions have positioned us extremely well to deal with those things, so things like ZATE, Aker, SKM, Guimar have put us in a tremendous position to leverage our capability in refining into those markets. And we're seeing a significant success in that places like the Middle East. There's a lot of activity in North America from the safety and compliance-driven projects, so this is tier 3 gasoline and the ISA 84 programs, the controls program. The combined spend there is probably something north of $20 billion over the next 5 years or a little less. And it plays very well to our strength, so we think that's going to be a terrific opportunity for us as well. Moving on now to oil and gas, still a very strong market globally, still a lot of investment in North America. CapEx is at historic highs. We see a lot of opportunity in the midstream and pipeline services areas. We've had some significant wins onshore in both upstream and midstream. Our Eagleton acquisition has been a nice leverage point for us as well. So there'll be a fair amount ongoing investment that I think we're in a great position to support. Obviously, the gas monetization business is not one that Jacobs plays in as a major player, but we are starting to see some opportunities for what I'll characterize as flow down projects, off-sites, utilities, that sort of thing. Up in the oil sands, the focus is still cost efficiency. Our gen-10 processing facilities in our Jacobs-branded well pads are a very strong position for us up there. And now that West Texas Intermediates moved up above $100, I think that bodes well for continuing investment in the oil sand. Moving on to chemicals. We've all heard the story there, lots of low-cost gas driving projects, tremendous volume of pre-FEED and FEED work, both in the shop today and backlog, and we're coming. Jacobs has great strengths in both derivatives and in the methanol cycle. We're doing quite well in terms of, again, winning FEEDs and pre-FEED. But it is a slow process to get the customers to release their budget. We're just not seeing the flow of projects from FEED into execute, that we'd like to see. And so that remains a challenge in the chemicals business as we go forward. Looking at the backlog numbers overall, good, flat quarter-over-quarter. Backlog can be pretty lumpy in these businesses, but good growth year-over-year. Moving now to Slide 12, our acquisition focus. We're pretty narrowly focused in the near term. Largely, our focus is on North America for upstream and telecommunications projects. We'll be pretty niche-focused on those acquisitions in the near term as well. The good news is that the acquisitions that we've made recently are all working quite well, Eagleton, FNS, SKM, Guimar, FMHC, all those acquisitions are now contributing in ways that we expect, and in ways that we didn't expect, very positively for the company going forward. Moving on now to my commercial slide, why Jacobs? We continue to have a unique and strong relationship-based business model with a high repeat business and a very unique market position. We have diversified markets, geographies and services, and that's certainly working for us. I think it's important that we're able to continue to grow, for example, in the public sector in spite of what people believe -- perceive is a pretty weak public sector market. We continue to be able to grow backlog. It is lumpy but we are demonstrating growth, and I think we'll be able to continue to do that. We've got a great balance sheet and a strong position going forward. And our cost position, I think, particularly after this restructuring, is going to create a really solid position for us from a competitive point of view as we look into FY '15 and beyond. So with that, I will turn it over to questions. Jamie, back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andy Wittmann from Robert W. Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Maybe, John, to start with you. I wanted to dig into the organic growth rates of the company. Can you talk to us about what the acquisition revenue contribution was for the quarter? And I don't even know if we got it for last quarter as well. It seems like it might be kind of flat to maybe down a little bit, but you tell us. And how do you reconcile that kind of performance versus a backlog which has been kind of steadily increasing or at least flat? John W. Prosser: Well, as we've been saying the last couple of quarters is that our underlying legacy operations have been slow and aren't growing up to what we had anticipated coming into this year, and so a lot of that has to do with the activity levels and the conversion levels, and a lot of the heavy process that just hasn't been moving as quickly as what we anticipated. We're still seeing things flowing into the backlog, but they just aren't converting as quickly as what we thought coming into the year. And think that's one of the reasons we've lowered guidance, besides all the fact -- the other things that have happened both in the first half and now the restructuring in the second half. Specifically, to the revenue, we don't do a lot of breakout because it's hard to start measuring that and continue to measure that after the acquisitions. As we start to consolidate, to move things around and even identifying backlog because, in some cases, we might have both been looking at the same prospects. And when we win it, is it because of Jacobs or because of the acquisition or is it because of both? So we lose that visibility, the clarity fairly quickly. So having said that, the contribution from primarily SKM but also from companies, other much smaller acquisitions that Craig picked out was probably in the $0.25 million -- $0.25 billion range, or $250 million, plus or minus. And that's kind of in line with what it was last quarter as well. So FNS didn't come in until July 1, so there's nothing in the June quarter that would be from FNS, if the others had come in earlier. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it, that's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up here on some of the restructuring initiatives. Since you're pretty well down that path now, can you give us a better sense about what the dollar amounts might be on an annualized basis? Maybe how much you've recognized now and how much you expect that you might be able to pull out when you're done with the initiatives that you have in place? John W. Prosser: Well, we don't give guidance in the future until -- we will be giving guidance on '15 at the end of our '14 year, so certainly, the benefits of that will be incorporated to that. At this point, we're not going to give any specific guidance for '15 or for the restructuring. When you look at the restructuring dollars that we're putting out about -- it's almost exactly 50-50 between the amount that's being spent on facility restructuring. In other words, getting out of leases and stuff like that, and the amount is being spent on people restructuring, which is a reduction of headcount or getting rightsized in geographies and such that we talked about. And so the people, obviously, tend to have a little faster payback for the most part, and the real estate has a little bit longer payout. But as we've analyzed it and all, the payout will be -- certainly justifies the actions that we have taken. But beyond that, we're not going to get into specifics at this time. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. And then maybe a different way of asking something similar. But clearly, SKM, it appears like it's having an impact on the distribution between growth and SG&A margin in terms of just mixing the higher gross margin. Is there anything in the quarter -- I mean should we assume that the restructuring charges were 100% in the SG&A line and that if you extract, if you pull that out, maybe is the run rate -- is there anything unique about the run rates and gross margin at 17.4% or SG&A margin at 11.8% which, adjusted for that, that would be unique to this quarter? John W. Prosser: No, not really. I mean, if you get into -- take the restructuring, and we gave some of the detail of the restructuring costs, and they all are in the SG&A. Get some benefit against bonuses and such that the gross dollars are a little bit higher than what is shown at the net SG&A charge. But they all are in the SG&A line. And if you take the amount, as you've done, I think the underlying operations were pretty solid for the quarter. And there wasn't any real unusual items. Just like most normal quarters we have some pluses, we have some minuses, but it was -- everything kind of took care of itself. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I guess 2 questions. One, just on the margin side if you exclude the restructuring, the margins were pretty good in the quarter. Is that just mix-related -- is that just mix or can you talk through what the -- what was driving the better margins? And then I guess just my second question, I guess, Craig, it's more a strategic one because nothing else macro or fundamentally seems to be changing here. I mean, what's the risk, as you look at the company, that your historic business model, in terms of you doing acquisitions to help drive growth and you focusing on the smaller projects versus the bigger ones, that it's going to be much -- given your size today, that Jacobs -- that the law of large number is starting to work against you, relative to where you were historically so you need to win bigger projects or do bigger deals to generate the EPS growth that you have historically? Because you don't seem as committed to 15% as you have been historically. John W. Prosser: I'll answer the first part which is the margin, and I think the margin line is pretty much in line taking out all the noise we had in the first half is kind of in line with where we were before the end of last year and where we continue because of the mix being more predominantly professional services. Also I think that some of the softness that we saw, particularly in our second quarter, as a result of the holiday vacation activities at SKM and other places did work its way through and that's behind and I think SKM is operating on a more in-line with more of the expectations that we originally had for them. And so the margin I think is kind of where we kind of expected it to be. Craig L. Martin: Jamie, it's interesting that you've asked that question because we had our senior team together all last week, basically, to look at actions and how we were going to go forward into '15 and beyond. And one of the things we looked at with some care was where our business model is and how it's working. And the conclusion we reached is that we're well-positioned in what is the largest segment of the marketplace, the small-cap area of the business, and that we should be able to continue to drive the growth that we've committed to and we are very committed to that 15% compound. We're struggling to get it, I accept, but we are very committed to it. If we continue to keep our focus where it belongs. If anything the criticism that came up in that discussion is that we've gotten a little bit too enamored with big projects, and maybe lost a little focus on our base business model. And so that's where our thinking is today, and I think we have every reason to believe our business model will support the kind of growth that we're committed to. Does that answer your question? Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I guess. So I have 2 questions related to that, and then I promise I'll get back in queue. I mean you have been talking over the past couple quarters, I mean you say you don\u2019t want to focus on big projects as much, but you have commented before there are a number of larger projects for you in the $1-billion-plus range or so, where are they today relative to what you saw in terms of moving forward? It sounds like pushed to the right. And then I guess my second question is, I mean why the reluctance to help us understand, I mean the restructuring charges you're taking are material for you in terms -- on an EPS basis. And they're material relative to anything you've done historically. So why is it acceptable that you're not helping people understand how we should think about the benefit in 2015, given the magnitude of the restructuring? I mean why wouldn't we assume you could at least get back what you -- we should get -- you should at least get the benefit of the charge you took this year? Craig L. Martin: Well, let me talk about the $1-billion project conversation first. Remember that we've always characterized this small project strategy as a Pac-Man strategy, i.e. one where we're able to eat up from underneath and increase our share of wallet by doing progressively larger projects. And that certainly remains a part of our strategy today, and these $1 billion jobs that I've talked about remain things that Jacobs is capable of doing and we continue to win some of those projects and lose some, just as you would expect. So I'm not suggesting those aren't important or that we're not going to continue to see that Pac-Man strategy work to our benefit. But I think our focus still needs to be where our base business model works best. And so that's really the key that we were talking about from an earlier perspective. I said of those $1 billion jobs we've done well in terms of wins and about maybe not quite so disappointed at the loss ratios you might expect. But the biggest struggle is getting those projects to convert. So we can be sitting on lots of nice FEEDs for $1-billion projects but if they don't turn in to execute, they don't really have much of an impact either on backlog, revenue or the P&L. And that's clearly a factor in terms of where we sit today. So as to the second question, I'll comment and then I'll let John add his. We will be prepared to talk more about the impacts of the restructuring as we talk about guidance for '15. But to have a discussion about the impacts of restructuring today and not be able to have a conversation about guidance for '15 is like half the equation. And I just don't think that's right. John? John W. Prosser: Yes, I agree with Craig. And historically, be it acquisitions, be it other things, we don't give piecemeal guidance. We give directional guidance, we give kind of strategic or qualitative guidance rather than quantitative guidance. And I think we just waited -- decided to wait and give the full picture for '15 and beyond. We have said that this is going to have a return, and the return, we feel, justifies the expense. And that as we go forward, you'll be seeing that impact in the financial statements, but it's just part of our -- what we will be reporting on as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Gabrielski from Stephens. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : So you made a comment that 96% of your business was repeat this quarter, and that was new record. Is that in any way indicative of a lack of discrete opportunities or -- and maybe that's why your organic growth is negative? Or is there something else driving that high of a percentage of repeat business? Craig L. Martin: It is not indicative of a lack of new opportunities. Our business is built around working for the big spenders in all the industries that we serve. And in no case do we have a share of wallet of any of those big spenders that even approaches double digits. So there's huge opportunity for us to grow on the back of repeat business, and the high-repeat business is an indication that we're putting our energies and focus where we should, which is with those clients that have big capital budgets where we can grow share and build relationships. What we find is that people who are not in that category tend to be people that we find challenges to work with. And sometimes they're folks who don't have any experience with major project investments, for example. Those kinds of projects are the ones that can seriously go south, and we try to avoid those as best we can. So I don't think that our high repeat business number is at all indicative of the some limitation on our growth, quite the contrary. John W. Prosser: In that, when we do get a new customer, and we are looking in adding customers, it tends to be smaller work to begin with. We get in through doing a FEED or doing some studies and such, and then we grow it. So it's not like it's likely that a new customer would come in with a significant award in a given quarter. It tends to become a growth structure all on its own and after a couple of quarters of doing FEEDs or smaller consultancy kinds of things, it becomes repeat business as we grow it. So I think that's right in line with our model as well. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. Was SKM accretive in the quarter? I know you called it out in the prior quarter, so I'm just wondering if there's any color any can give there? John W. Prosser: Yes, it was. It added about $0.11. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. When you look at backlog conversion, I mean you're talking about negative organic growth year-on-year, if we use your numbers. Is there something in backlog that we should be worried about? Is that risk of cancellation? I mean your backlog either accelerates and converts into revenue here or goes away, I guess, right? Those are the 2 outcomes. So what is it about that backlog that we should even feel confident it's going to contribute to revenue growth in '15? Craig L. Martin: There's always the risk of cancellation risk. Backlog can be strong, and if customers decide they're just not going to go forward, you can see a fair amount of work fall out of backlog. Probably lower risk right now because of the nature of the work that's in backlog than it is historically. Certainly, for example, construction-related backlog is more vulnerable to cancellations than service-related backlog, has a longer tail and it's the bigger part of the costs that the customer might incur. So those risks are out there. But I don't see any evidence that those risks are things that are likely to materialize. When we talk to customers about their projects and programs, it's not about not doing the work, it's more about timing of doing the work in terms of when is it going to happen. And of course, we've been very careful about putting things in the backlog until they've gotten that final investment decision or until we're fairly certain that they're going to happen. So I think the risk of backlog not converting is not particularly high, it is in fact low. But like I say that we get a global financial crisis or something happens with oil prices, that would certainly have an impact. Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then one last one, sorry, but cap allocation. So I think the market's sending a message to Jacobs that something's not right. And Jacobs sends a message back that we're going to keep doing what we're going to do. So I'm just wondering, from your perspective, when you look at your balance sheet, why that isn't a viable source of opportunity to go into the market and send a message back? John W. Prosser: I would say that the underlying foundation of that is we still believe there's opportunities on the horizon for acquisitions and have continued to -- will continue to feed that above organic growth kinds of rates that we talked about. As Craig said earlier, we're still very committed to that 15% long-term growth. And in that model, there's a portion of it, 1/3 or so of it, that's going to have to come from acquisitions. So while we can't time those acquisitions, particularly the ones on the larger side, they come when there's opportunities, in the short run, we're going to build our balance sheet so we can take advantage of that. In the long run, if we got to a point where our cash continued to grow and the opportunities for deploying that capital as for acquisition grows and growth of the business, then as we said, we will have to look at alternatives. But we don't think those decisions are made on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but they tend to have to be made looking at our longer-term horizon. And we don't believe that the performance in the last couple quarters and such is indicative of what the long-term growth opportunities for us, both from our own organic growth and our long-term acquisition growth. So we continue to discuss that both with management and at the board level. And we look at the allocations of capital, and is there something we should be doing. And at this point, we are managing our capital for the long-term growth of the company. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just coming back to the margins, the 5.6% margin x restructuring reflects that 60% mix of professional services that you talked. But I'm just trying to get a sense of how much pressure you might see there if the mix moved back to sort of a 50-50 balance? With the restructuring, I mean, should we assume that you could keep it above 5%? John W. Prosser: So I think our long-term margin will continue to trend up. There will be a little bit of headwind as we get through, probably '15 as more of the construction activity that we're expect is coming in. But at the same time, we believe as that activity starts picking up, we'll have opportunities to improve our overall margins on both sides of the -- on both markets. So we'll have a little bit of improvement on the professional services that'll help offset some of the weight. And given our mix of business, and certainly the activities we have outside the U.S. and such where we're more likely to do things on a construction management modes and such, that I don't think we'll see -- I'm not sure we'll get back to 50-50. I mean I think that we'll see a period of time when the field services and construction grows as we go through probably later '15 into '16 and such. But I would think that we should be able to maintain margins somewhere around the mid-15 -- mid-5 to 6 depending on the mix. So I think, as we see the markets start moving a little bit better and accelerating, we might see an uptick in the margins before we see the pressure coming from the construction as well. So I would think that margins will be steady to up over the next couple years rather than down. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful, John, and then... John W. Prosser: We have good continuing G&A control is going to help add to that. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, good. Could you guys talk about how contract terms are developing in the marketplace in terms of fixed price versus cost plus? And is that affecting your organic growth rate at all? And maybe what's your willingness to take on different risks than you might have historically to kind of get things going a little bit faster? Craig L. Martin: Well, certainly what we're seeing in the market from a lot of our customers is a more aggressive position with respect to contract terms. That's a broad characterization, so it has to do with not only whether it's fixed price or not fixed price. But as much to do with limits of liability and payment terms and a whole bunch of other issues that impact the business. So our main customers are perceiving the market as being weak, that's certainly an expression of the pricing discussion that we had earlier, and they're trying to take advantage of that by imposing more challenging contract terms. Although I think the lump sum issue is less of a factor than the other terms might be. With respect to lump sum contracting, our customers continue to be anxious to go lump sum in jurisdictions where that's easy to do and there's lots of competition, so certainly we're seeing a lump sum EPC in the Middle East as an ongoing method of delivery. In places where it's more complex or where there's concerns about the availability of labor, we're not seeing lump sum contracting to the same degree. We do see, from time to time, customers take on a lump sum contract because one of our competitors has decided the only way to win is to take that construction risk. And so far, we've very successfully resisted going there. So that's kind of the landscape. We're trying to continue to do the same job we've done in the past in getting conservative terms that balance the risk-reward. But it's certainly a tougher environment in which to try to do that. Did that answer your question, Steven? Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes, it did. And have you completed those European projects yet that were challenged last quarter? Craig L. Martin: One of those projects is operational. The other project is not yet complete, but we don't see any further risk in that project. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Craig, so everything -- in your presentation, everything except one segment you listed as improving or strong or growing. And so I guess my question is with those descriptions, do you have any better visibility toward an acceleration in backlog growth? And what do we need to get there? Do we need better economic conditions with a little inflation help? As we sit here today versus, let's say, last year at this time, do you have any better visibility that backlog growth will increase for you guys? Craig L. Martin: Honestly, I can't say that we do. As I sit here and look at where we are with our customers and what they're telling us about the drivers for them to make investment decisions, I'm not seeing a significant certainty time-wise about when they're going to make those decisions. So in terms of real backlog acceleration, I just -- I'm very frustrated, but I can't predict when that's likely to happen. And I've been wrong before in terms of trying to predict it, so I'm maybe a little overly cautious right now about that. There are some businesses we're in where the drivers are regulatory and we're coming up on the point where those particular projects will have to be built. But even that could be as much as 5 quarters 3, 4 quarters away. So for us, at least, it's a very difficult time in terms of trying to predict when this stuff is going to start happening and when it's going to start going our way. And I'm very frustrated by that but that's the truth of the matter. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So I guess, Craig, how would you characterize this time? Are we in some sort of mid-cycle pause? Some investors tell me that they think the cycle is over already. Like what do you guys think if you look at, I guess I would focus more on your heavy-process business in making this -- in having this question, but where do you think we are in this cycle? Craig L. Martin: I certainly don't see any evidence that the cycle is over. I do see an abundance of caution from our customers about the cycle and where they are in it and what the likely outcomes are for their projects. And I think that's actually turning this in from sort of what I think we all believed a couple years ago was going to be boom-like into a much more protracted, less boom-like environment. And so in some ways, the customers are getting what they want out of that, pricing staying down, competition staying high and so projects are getting done, logically speaking, at lower costs. So I think that's more of the situation as I see it. The issues are cost certainty, permitting certainty, a little bit of overall economy. When I talked to some of the executives at the tops of the organizations we work for, the general belief about the strength of the economy is not as good as what the popular press would have you believe. And I think that's also affecting that sort of on-the-border decision, should we go ahead and commit or not, let's wait a little while. All those things seem to be adding up to a protracted boom, if you want to call it that, rather than the kind of boom that I think we all were expecting when the cheap gas phenomenon first started. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, Craig, that's helpful. One of the outcomes of the situation seems like larger consolidation in the space. I know you guys see the same things that we do. How do you think that this impacts your business? And do you think this gives you some incentives to go after bigger acquisitions? Do you need to go after bigger acquisitions given the consolidation that we're seeing happen in the bigger E&C space? Craig L. Martin: We've looked at the consolidations a bit to try to understand what the impact might be on us. Frankly, the ones that we've seen, we don't think will have a particularly significant impact. Certainly, some of the combinations look like they certainly bring scale. But in most cases, it doesn't appear to us that they bring concentration. And in a few cases where they do bring concentration, it's in markets where, we believe, the customers tend to split the baby and share the work around. So where a concentration is occurring in a couple of these businesses, it's in a market where the customer says, \"Well, everybody gets 10%.\" So 10% plus 10% equals 10%. And so that might actually be good for Jacobs if our share is 8%, we might get to 10% or maybe we can get to 11% or 12%. So overall, as we look at what happened so far, we don't think that has a meaningful negative impact on our business, nor do we think the story that those bigger companies might be able to tell the customer will drive them to choose one of the bigger companies over Jacobs. We have sufficient diversity and geographic reach, that we're pretty well credible in every market we serve. The only place that we're not credible is power, and that's not really a market we've gotten a lot of traction in yet. So I think the net of all that is that these consolidations aren't that bad for Jacobs. So that's part 1 of the question. Part 2 of the question, in terms of needing to do bigger deals, I don't think so. I actually think that the opportunity to continue to do smaller deals, the SKM-scale deals and less is every bit as big as it's ever been, and I think they are considerably lower risk. I think the premiums that you have to pay for the earnings are considerably lower as well. And so when I look at the whole thing kind of on balance, if anything, I think it will allow us to accelerate our growth in terms of getting good acquisition deals and then being able to leverage those. Big public company deals still scare me, frankly. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got it. And just maybe a very specific question on telecom. You're moving into telecom relatively quickly. The spend this year seemed a little more choppy from some of the big customers. Have you guys seen that? And what do you see for telecom going forward, specifically? Craig L. Martin: There's no question in my mind that the spending has become a bit more choppy in the telecom business. We've seen some customers pull back in one area, advance spending in another area, ship suppliers. The net effect of all that, at least as we sit here today, for us, has been positive, it's allowed us to increase our share. And we think we're going to be able to continue to do that. I still think we're on track for that being a $1-billion business in a very short period of time, looking forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: I just wanted to touch more specifically just on chemical. So you noted, particularly, there more measured approaches from the customer base. Is that specific -- I mean we heard from one of your peers some of the crackers actually are moving ahead and anticipate quite a number will be released still in 2014 domestically and a number internationally. Is your comment more specific to the secondary and tertiary plants? Or do you see that reluctance really across the board? Craig L. Martin: Well, I can't really speak to the ethylene cycle other than to -- and offer an opinion as to about what it's going to cost to get it. I do think some additional crackers will get approved. I think of the number, I think it's 9 or 11 that have been suggested will go, we're not going to see anywhere near all that. I think you're looking at, longer term, another bust in ethylene pricing if all of that gets built, so that's a challenge. With respect to what that means to us from a chemical standpoint, obviously, we're very derivatives focus, we're not in the ethylene cycle. And so the more crackers that get built, the more opportunity there is in the derivatives world. So we would see additional crackers being built, being released as a positive for the business overall. We also see it as a positive for availability of resources and our ability to increase prices. So in the grand scheme of things, more ethylene is a good news story for Jacobs but it's probably longer term than for folks who are primary ethylene cycle providers. If you look at the rest of the chemicals market, there's a substantial part of the business that isn't driven by ethylene expansion. There we're seeing projects that are really stuck on the money side of it or stuck on the permitting side. We got a couple of customers with very major expansions whose whole issue is we're not doing anything until we get permits. And that could push that project, one in particular I'm thinking of, out for another 15 months before the permits are available. I'm confident we'll do the work when the permits are available and I'm confident they'll get the permits, but it's certainly pushing out the timing for when the job might get to go. So it's those kinds of things. There's a lot of money being spent in the heavy process industries, between oil and gas and chemicals, in particular, there's a lot of money being spent. When we look at it, the vast majority of that is going to exploration and production, but there's still pretty decent expectations for the chemicals market. I think for us, though, we need to see a little more willingness to go to that final investment decision to really start to drive the backlog in the earnings. Did I answer your question? Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Yes, you did. And just secondly, maybe just touching on the tier 3 upgrades in the U.S. I think you previously talked about something in the order of 80 to 90 projects, several hundred million dollars apiece. Maybe give us an update on how big the pipeline is as you see it today, and how quickly that comes to market. Craig L. Martin: Pipeline continues to look good. There's probably 80 or so -- 80 to 85, I guess, would be the right range of those kinds of projects out there. Probably average size is something like $200 million, although they're quite widespread. So it's plus or minus maybe $15 billion, $17 billion of the investment. We think we're about 40% through the award cycle for those projects, maybe a little better. I didn't look at it for this quarter's review, but last quarter, we were right at 40% awarded, 60% yet to award. So there's still a substantial amount of work out there. And of course, the awards start in the FEED cycle, so there's still a substantial amount of EPC or EPCM work to be awarded even in the 40% that have been awarded on a FEED basis. We've done very well. I think I cited last quarter about 50% of the ones that have been awarded have been awarded to us. And that's, I think, a pretty good hit ratio in this industry. And I have every reason to think that's going to continue. A number of the customers are continuing to be able to buy credits or otherwise work around the tier 3 rules, so I think that's driving some slowness in the award cycle. I would've told you a year ago that almost everything would be awarded by now. But as I said, we still got about 60% to go. So good opportunities, good outlook going forward. We are finding people who have just completely avoided the problem, they are all going to have to address the tier 3 regulations, it's just a matter of timing. Operator : Our next question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just wanted to follow up on the comment about pricing pressure. Can you talk a little about where you're seeing the pricing pressure most severe? Is it in a particular segment or is it across the board? And how are you seeing the wage inflation in light of the pricing environment? Craig L. Martin: Sure. Pricing pressure is probably strongest in the heavy-process industries and in mining and minerals. Mining and minerals driven obviously by the shortage of work, and the heavy-process industry being driven largely because most of the work today is engineering-related, and engineering has become increasingly fungible globally. So when we look at those businesses, the opportunity to move margins is relatively limited. We're getting tiny improvements in our margin, and I mean like 4-basis-points improvement in our margin. But the progress is, practically speaking, it's flat. And I think we're doing well to hold it flat, quite frankly, because we're seeing some very aggressive behavior by some of our competitors. In other businesses, the pricing pressure is not so strong. For example, Pharma is looking better because of this increase that I just -- I mentioned earlier, and the number of projects that are out there. A lot of the, sort of, what are other markets for us, so high-tech, power, pulp and paper, food and consumer products, pretty price-neutral, not much movement one way or the other there. And on the government markets, it still continues to be a cost-plus market. And so for the most part, that business does not -- is not experiencing much in the way of pricing pressures, although the federal government aspect of that public and institutional market is seeing a little pricing pressure as the customers start to drive recompetes for a higher proportion of price in the evaluation criteria. So it's a mixed bag across the board. In terms of geography, by industry, there's not much variability. So wherever you are in the world, in the oil and gas business, the pricing pressure is about the same. Where you get markets that are more geographically specific and limited, again, I'll go to public and institutional marketplaces, pricing pressure is probably not quite as great. But again, things like federal government, pretty significant. Did I answer your question, Vishal? Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes, you did. That's very helpful. Just one follow-up. Is this mostly coming from international players? Or are you seeing companies from the U.S. that are being more aggressive? Craig L. Martin: We don't see -- let me talk first about what -- can you all hear me okay? [Technical Difficulty] Craig L. Martin: Let me separate international competitors into 2 categories. So one category would be Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Indians, some of the more low-cost EPC-lump-sum-oriented organizations. We generally don't compete with those companies and so I can't really speak to pricing there, although I suspect it's not a fun business to be in right now. We see the big U.S. and European players, so the CB&Is, the Foster Wheelers, the AmEx, the Atkins, as well KBR, URS, AECOM, Fluor, Bechtel, those folks from the States. And there's the place where I'm describing what I see as the cost pressure. So it's not Koreans because -- or those or the Chinese that are affecting our numbers, particularly, it's much more that competitors set of the U.S. and European public companies in the engineering construction space. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : It's Matt Rybak on behalf of Jerry. I wanted to start off and hopefully take a second if you don't mind to kind of flesh out the U.S. public construction outlook and possibly provide us with an order trend update and what you're seeing in that end market currently. John W. Prosser: When we look at the U.S. market, primarily, I think you're talking about what we would categorize as our building and infrastructure, because most of the federal government and such tends to be more professional technical services than heavy construction and such. I think that what we're seeing in both those markets, as well as opportunities globally is on the infrastructure, there continues to be good opportunities, good spend. State and local governments are finding alternative ways of funding projects, either through design build, 3P kind of opportunities or bonds or revenue. [indiscernible] they are not waiting for resolution of the federal government, as such. On the building business for us, the public building business still is fairly soft, particularly the federal government. But we're seeing opportunities, and as Craig alluded to in his comments, we have made a switch -- or a movement of that, focusing more in the private sector or quasi-private sector where you get into health care, which would be hospitals, clinics and such, or in some of the mission-critical data center businesses which tend to be more private sector, but there's a lot of activity in those markets. So we see those both as directionally good. They are becoming more of a global market for us. But we're also seeing opportunities, from a global aspect, that 3, 4, 5 years ago, we wouldn't have really focused on in those markets as well. Matthew Rybak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Sure, that's really helpful. And then switching gears a little bit onto the SKM integration. Can you just talk a little bit about, and I know you've discussed how it's progressing, but just how that might -- that integration is kind of different and/or similar to other acquisitions? Have you been able to pick up things, from prior acquisitions in the past that you're able to apply to this one, or is it completely disparate in sort of takeaways? Craig L. Martin: Let me speak to that. It isn't at all different from previous acquisitions, in the sense that the issues for integration and both the people issues, the systems issues, the process and procedure issues, are all pretty much the same. And we have applied our learning from the 60-plus previous acquisitions to the integration of SKM. And we've had the benefit, because SKM did a lot of acquisitions, of being able to apply their experience in doing acquisitions as well. And in fact, in some cases, that's made the integration easier because SKM is already accustomed to the kinds of things that had to happen in acquisitions, and so the team expected some of those kinds of changes. The differences in terms of the SKM acquisition are all, for practical purposes, are all relations to the timing. So catching the summer holiday and some of the challenges with the integration costs in the early process, the weak market in mining and minerals, all contributed to a slower start than we usually expect from an integration. But we think we have almost all of that behind us at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas from Sterne Agee. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Craig, how is your client's refining market looking at the condensate export issues and how that could have an impact on potential spend and flows? Craig L. Martin: I can't probably give you a very good answer. It isn't a conversation I've had with those clients recently. My overall speculation is that it's going to be a factor in their decision making but not a major factor. But as I say, I haven't really had a chance to sit down with the key players and say, \"What's this going to mean to you?\" Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : But it does seem from the tone of your prepared remarks, given some of the rumors and some expansions we're seeing that might happen in the Gulf Coast, that the opportunities for the refining business still is quite strong for the company, no? Craig L. Martin: I think the refining business will remain a strength of the company. I think there's significant opportunity out there. As I said in my prepared remarks, I'm more excited about tier 3 and controls-related activities, the ISA work, because I'm -- there's a fairly high degree of certainty that it will happen, and there's a deadline by when it has to take place. I think there are going to be crude slate changes. I think there will be configuration opportunities as well. And those will be a positive, no question about it, but we remain very positive about the refining market, overall. Operator : Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : This is Sean Eastman on behalf of Tahira today. First off, this has been mentioned briefly but I was hoping you could talk a bit more about your initiatives, both on the midstream space, as well as the telecom space and just how you're feeling about the outlook. Craig L. Martin: Sure. Let me start with the midstream/upstream space. We've done a number of very small acquisitions there, and we're in the process of consolidating those. That's starting to get significant traction. We've had a number of awards, a couple of which we've been able to announce, that are fairly significant in terms of North American alliance kind of levels of relationships. So my expectation is that, that will continue to be a good market and we will be able to continue to accelerate our growth there. The challenge is simply that we're starting from a small base. This wasn't a business we were particularly noted for, even 3 years ago. And so we're really -- we're running hard. And I think we're going to start to see some real contribution from that growth. On the telecom side, I think it's very much the same thing. The customers clearly want a first-tier supplier. They are -- in some cases, I think they're happy with the -- one or more of their first-tier suppliers today, there are a couple already. But I think the idea of having another supplier or 2 at that level is very attractive to them. And there are some customers expressing dissatisfaction with their current tier 1 providers, or at least 1 or 2 of them. So I think the opportunity remains very significant, and we're gaining traction every day. That business, I think, will grow pretty rapidly over the next couple, 3 years. And as I've said, I think it won't be long before that's a $1 billion business for us. So both markets, both relatively nascent for Jacobs represent significant growth opportunities. Sean Eastman : Okay, that's helpful. And also could you just provide some qualitative commentary on the outlook for pass-through revenues next year versus this year? John W. Prosser: Pass-through revenues tend to follow construction. Although some of them come up in the technical services space when we're subcontracting services and stuff like that, so there's activities there and such. But it tends to be a function of the direct-hire construction or the construction where we're doing it with -- on our paper, even though we might be doing it through subcontracting and such like that. So it'll bounce around quarter-to-quarter just because project activity levels do move around a little bit. But it tends to track more the field services revenue than the professional services. And looking through '15 and '16, it's probably mid to late '15 that we'll start seeing the field services numbers growing and out into '16, so we'd probably see the pass-throughs picking up as we get late into next year and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from John Rogers from D.A. Davidson. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Two quick things. First of all, John, what are you using for total restructuring and unusual charges for the 9 months? John W. Prosser: That would be, as we talked about in the first 2 quarters, the first quarter was a net of $0.05, the second quarter was a net of $0.19, and those were the unusual items. And then this quarter, we have the $0.35. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Okay, I just wanted to make sure. And then secondly, Craig, in terms of your strategic planning that you referred to earlier and recently and 15% growth rate, with your comments about a somewhat slow overall recovery and market growth, do you have to increase the acquisition contribution assumption for more than just 1/3 to get to that 15% on a long-term basis? Craig L. Martin: I think there's 2 different -- or 3 different questions there, let me try to answer them. In terms of the long-term basis, as we model out growth, that 1/3 kind of number continues to be and look to us to be fine. So as we think about the long term, the likelihood of needing more than that in an acquisition growth hasn't changed. I don't think we will need that. But as you know, the acquisition business can be pretty lumpy. And so we're going to see some years where the acquisition growth is significantly greater than the organic growth. And we're going to see other years where it's just the opposite. I can recall years where we grew earnings 20% and had no acquisition growth. And I can remember other years where we grew earnings 20% and almost all of that came from acquisitions. So it's a mixed bag in that regard. If I think about where we are right now, I'm not running around worrying about going out and making more acquisitions to drive the growth number. I think we're in a great position to drive the growth number going forward. I think we've got a -- still got a lot of leverage in the recent acquisitions we've made. So our strategy -- acquisition strategy in the near term is very targeted. All that goes out the window if an opportunity that just makes a huge amount of sense for the shareholders shows up. But there's not one knocking on the door at the moment anyway. Does that answer your question, John? John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : It does, I'm just trying to -- just seems like it's been so long where we've seen anything near 10% organic growth. And it seems like we're a long way away from getting back there, given the market. Craig L. Martin: Well, '13 was a relatively slow year from an acquisitions growth, and I think we had 10% organic growth at the bottom line or pretty close to it. So I think it's a year-by-year thing. And it's a constant challenge. But I don't think long-term 10% organic growth is not something that we should expect. And I don't think long term we can expect -- we should expect less than that 15% compound. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Ward from Wells Fargo. Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A question, just a quick one, a bit more on the near-term guidance. Your guidance for Q4 implies kind of maybe high $0.80 range, which would be up maybe about $0.05 from Q3. You still have a lot of restructuring in Q4 that you're going to benefit from and you'll get the full benefit from the Q3 restructuring. So is it fair to assume that the margins -- you're assuming margins are going to be up in Q4 from Q3? And if that is the case, does that imply that you guys are thinking that revenues might be actually maybe down a bit in Q4 from Q3? John W. Prosser: The first part of your comments, I think I would agree with that generally, we don't give specific quarterly guidance. But clearly, that is what would be construed from the annual number we're talking about and all. I think that there's going to be a mix of both, maybe a little bit better margins as we get a little benefit out of the restructuring, but it's also going to be volume. We are seeing, while modest, we are seeing a little bit of pickup on the hours as we look at each week. So it's going to be a combination of the 2. We don't forecast or give guidance on revenues per se, but I think it's going to be a combination of the 2 with, probably, volume as important as any margin improvement. Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great, and then... John W. Prosser: It's going to be modest because, as you say, the guidance, if it is a little bit higher, it's not dramatically higher in the next quarter. Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just a quick one on the increase in the restructuring costs. You called out, essentially, as you got into the details of that, it's going to be a bit more expensive than you thought. And then also the tax benefits not what previously expected. But was there also, part of that, a need to essentially take up maybe a little bit more cost structure than you previously thought, as maybe revenues are maybe a little bit weaker than expected? Or... John W. Prosser: No, I don't think we saw a big change in that. I think just as we got into the details and evaluating things like real estate and part of that is you have to evaluate what opportunities for sub-rentals and subleasing and such like that. And as we got into more of the details, it just the numbers changed, the number of people in several markets, as we sliced and diced, changed, particularly in Southern Europe, where even small numbers of people changes can have a significant dollar amount. So I think it was a couple of things that we thought maybe were on the cusp, and decided to take some actions as we really started focusing on. And so there wasn't any one big item that got added that added that 20%. It was just refining the numbers and getting more accurate. And probably erring on the side of doing more than -- and getting it behind us than doing less. And I think that the taxes became very much dependent on the geographies and that gets very complicated, so I'm not going to do a [indiscernible] on tax accounting. But what you can and can't tax benefit in the current period versus getting it over time as the operations improve and such came into that a little bit as well. Craig L. Martin: If I can add to that. One of the clear messages to the organization internal to Jacobs' was, look, we're not going to do this every quarter, every year, every other year like some companies. The last time we did something like this was in 1994. The next time we do something like this, I expect to be well retired. So when you say, get -- anything that needs doing in a way of restructuring, you better do it now because you're not going to get another chance. I think that drives the number a little bit as well. Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And then one more quick one. You talked about the pricing pressure from the U.S. and EU competitors. Was it coming from kind of 1 or 2, or is it more broad than that? Craig L. Martin: It's pretty broad. There are 1 or 2 culprits I can think of in particular, but I'm not going to mention their names. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chase Jacobson from William Blair. Chase Jacobson - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Just one more on the restructuring, if I could. Given that it sounds like you're trying to get as much out of the way as possible, it looks like you're spending close to $100 million. Can you give any sense as to how long you expect it will take to recognize that in savings? And is it fair to assume that the large majority of the savings will be recognized in the first couple years? And I know you don't want to give specific guidance, but just any color would be really helpful. John W. Prosser: Well, I guess the comment I would make on that, since we aren't giving specific guidance, as I said, it's about 50% facility-related and about 50% people-related. The payback on the people tends to be shorter than the payback on the facilities. But I would say that some of the facilities will be -- individual paybacks might be 5-plus years, people have -- comes out a little shorter. But I guess that's about all the guidance I'm going to give as far as the average duration or anything like that, because that just backs into a number that somebody will pin on '15 and we're not ready to do that yet. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks. Craig L. Martin: Just quickly, thank you all for joining the call and your interest in the company. I think we have a pretty good story. I know you need to see it materialize in the numbers, and we're going to do our best to make sure that it does, and I look forward to having another call soon where we can talk about the results that demonstrate that. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John Prosser, EVP of Finance and Accounting. John Prosser : Thank you, Michelle. Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter year-end conference call. I will briefly go over the financial highlights for the quarter here and then I'll turn it over to Craig Martin, our CEO, to give a business overview and outlook. Moving to Slide 4, just on the financial highlights as we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.65 and for the year year-to-date was $2.48 and neither of these numbers include the -- I should say - both these numbers include the effect of both the restructuring that we had in the second half of the year and also the items that we have called out earlier in the year in the first half. Our backlog ended up for the quarter at 18.4 billion, nice growth year-over-year, pretty much flat with the prior quarter. Nice growth in the professional services side but we continue to see a slowdown in the field service and on the conversion to field services.  Book-to-bill still is a good 1.09 on a trailing 12. We continue to have a strong balance sheet. Our cash position is 732 million, is basically flat with last quarter but during the quarter we had both about 150 million that we spent for the acquisition of FNS and then the stock buyback that we initiated in September, we acquired a 1.5 million shares for a total cost of about $78 million. If you add those back into the cash, we actually had a very good cash generating quarter. And we are initiating fiscal year guidance of the range of 3.35 to 3.85. This is a nice growth I believe over this year. While we expect the year to be a good year in that line the first quarter as is typical historically will be down from the September quarter. We would anticipate that that could be in the range of $0.08 to $0.12 impact because of holidays, vacations and other slowdowns that we typically see in our first quarter. Moving to Slide 5, this is just a historical trend on our history and weighing in the growth that we expect for this next year looking at the historical growth rate, while we target the 15% long-term growth, this still is a little bit trailing below that but we believe this will be a [trend this] [ph] year and get us back toward that 15% long-term growth rate, that we still believe is a good target for us. Moving to Slide 6, backlog, again as I said nice year-over-year growth the - flat with last quarter, but still good growth on the professional services side while field service was down slightly from the last quarter and even from the last year. So with that, I will turn it over to Craig Martin to review our business strategies. Craig Martin :  Thank you, John. Before I begin I just want to take a moment for those of you who are on this call who might not be with us next week in New York or Boston to remind you that John Prosser has elected to retire and will be leaving the Company\u2019s full time engagement in January. John has been our CFO for 30 years and an employee for 40 and I just wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate him and compliment him on what a terrific job he has done as a part of our leadership team over a very long period of time. With that in mind, I\u2019ll now talk about growth strategy, it doesn\u2019t change and it hasn\u2019t. We continue to focus on differentiating our business by using our relationship-based business model. We continue to work our market diversity to try to keep the business balanced across the various markets and keep the growth going. We are expanding our geographic presence every day for our multi-domestic approach. And we\u2019re taking our cash and using it to promote growth whether that\u2019s through acquisitions or as we have done recently through a buyback. We also continue to drive down cost. This is the only point I am going to expand on a little bit later on. And we are doing that from both the restructuring you saw and our constant attention to keeping our cost down, the market remains frankly very price sensitive. And what we\u2019ve done in restructuring and what we\u2019re doing to control G&A continues to improve our competitive position in that challenging market. Turning now to Slide 8, and I\u2019ll remind you all of our business model, we\u2019re very much focused on client loyalty and long-term repeat business. You can see how the model works here, it\u2019s what we think of as a virtuous circle in that we get the loyalty, we use that to drive growth and improve our performance that creates more loyalty and that\u2019s a virtuous upward curve. Our repeat business for fiscal '14 was the best it\u2019s ever been at 97.2%, we\u2019re very pleased with our ability to get that repurchase loyalty and continue to grow the business. Turning now to Slide 9, this is that market diversity we were talking about. You can see that the balance between our markets remains pretty constant, public institution was up a bit, process is flat, industrial is down a bit, but overall the business continues to have good balance across all of the markets that we serve. Let me take now and move on to Slide 10 and talk about some of those markets individually. So here we\u2019re looking at the public and institutional markets. Take a look first I think it\u2019s a backlog growth curves over to the right. You can see we\u2019ve gotten compound growth of 16% in the public sector markets between Q4 of '12 and Q4 or '14. I think that\u2019s a very good track-record in particular when you consider the overall view of the North American public sector market, I mean very specifically U.S. public sector market. I think we\u2019re demonstrating our ability to continue to grow the business steadily and aggressively in the face of stiff competition and challenging markets. Looking at the individual markets, let\u2019s start with the National Government business. We continue to see lots of opportunity in the defense and security world. Our recent acquisition of SKM, although it doesn\u2019t feel so recent anymore, certainly is a big plus and helping us grow in Australia and Asia Pacific and we see a lot of significant investment in this area there. We\u2019re hopeful that the U.S. mid-term elections are going to provide better budget certainly and that that will continue to represent a stimulus for our U.S. business. And we\u2019re really pleased with how strong the Nuclear Cleanup business continues to be, very strong in UK, lots of opportunity in North America. We recently announced our win at Sellafield that\u2019s somewhere between $300 million and $500 million worth of nuclear cleanup work, a really nice win for us and one of the two results we were talking about last quarter that we thought we were going to win, so one of two\u2019s in the old and other is yet to come. Another area where we\u2019ve had really good success on the back of our acquisition at FNS is in the Intelligence Community and we\u2019ve already had significant wins in that area that have been a nice add or two to our backlog as well. Moving on now to infrastructure, the transportation market is pretty buoyant worldwide, we\u2019re doing particularly well in places like U.S. and Australia but we see a large investment in the Middle East coming and because of our position with Zeit and our history in the Middle East and our strength in terms of the diversity of markets that we serve. I think we\u2019re in an excellent position to take advantage of that growth. We\u2019re also seeing lots of utility demand in water projects. It\u2019s a giant growth area across the world. We see something north of $70 billion worth of project commitments potentially out there. And then our framework agreements with our clients whether it\u2019s in telecom, infrastructure, buildings continue to be an important aspect of our business and we think we we\u2019ll see continuing growth there as well. Moving on now to buildings, our buildings list is growing globally, we\u2019ve seen significant awards, we have had some since the quarter closed we had some major awards in the Middle East in the buildings and infrastructure space. Healthcare is another area where we see continuing growth and tremendous opportunity in lots of places in the world people are getting older and that\u2019s going to drive a continuing expansion of spend. We had a really good year from bond issue passing and take wells and things like that most of those mid-term bonds passed and that will drive additional business. And then we continue to be very-very excited about the high-tech markets particularly things like mission, critical facilities, data center, huge market and we\u2019re very well position in that business. Overall these last two markets infrastructure and buildings have also been strongly benefited by our acquisition of SKM, tremendous leverage there as we become a clear global player in those businesses. Moving on now to Slide 11, let\u2019s start with Pharma Bio. We told you last quarter that we saw a pretty good set of prospects out there those things are starting to come home. We\u2019ve had some significant wins here since the beginning of the quarter, the quarter we\u2019re in I mean. And we\u2019re seeing lots of activity in investments, you know how well positioned we are in India and you can see there is a very significant amount of investment plan for India. We have that great footprint around the world for this business and we see really more than $2 billion worth of new work potential and a very short window as we look forward. So we\u2019re feeling better about the pharma market that we\u2019ve felt for some time. Moving on to mining and minerals, still a week market globally but we see some opportunities for growth. The areas we\u2019ve consistently talked about which are the sustaining capital, asset optimization those kinds of things, that\u2019s where the big spend is relatively speaking today and we continue to take share in that part. I am very happy with our ability to penetrate the small cap and sustaining cap work for our customers, both in the copper side of business and in iron ore. There are some things going on that are starting to show a few major prospects particularly in copper and we think we\u2019ll see the opportunity to benefit from some of that. And we\u2019re also starting to see a little bit of spending from the majors in the iron ore space. We think that\u2019s also a good news story for Jacobs. We have a very strong position in our iron ore. Moving on now to pulp paper, the sort of all other category it continues to be a mixed bag. We\u2019re seeing a little power work in Middle East. We continue to have good position in the UK and Europe in the power side. So that business will be okay it\u2019s not going to move the needle in the short-term, but it is relatively interesting what we\u2019re able to accomplish. If you think about the food and consumer products business, we\u2019re getting a number of alliances with major international player that continues to be an area of expansion for us. Most of those are India-centric, so our very strong position in India gives us a very high leverage which we worked for some time, our work for them now in India and then there is lots of industrial work out there, upgrade improvements. In particular I wanted to point out the paper machine conversions that are going on. We\u2019re one of the very few companies out there with the capability today to do paper machine work, it\u2019s increasingly like the pharma business and that we\u2019re the last person standing. And we think that represents pretty good leverage for us as we go forward. The industrial business you can see the backlog over all is up year-over-year, but down a little quarter-over-quarter and down from two years ago. I still think the year-over-year growth is significant and I think the opportunity is to see better growth going forward in '15 is high. So this is one of those areas where we think there is opportunity for Jacobs to see ongoing growth. Moving now to Slide 12, this is the heavy process side of our business. Again I\u2019ll start with the backlog situation over in the lower right. We did have a weak sales quarter last quarter in the heavy process business. But as I pointed out repeatedly that\u2019s always a lumpy business comparatively speaking. There is lots of EPC in that business, lots of construction dollars. So it tends to be more lumpy than some of our other businesses. There also were one or two project cancellation, the one of which I believe was significant. And we\u2019re seeing real weakness in the oil sands just because of where oil prices are. The oil sands market is apart, it\u2019s a very difficult market for us right now. Looking at the individual areas within the process group, refining continues to be a good business as we see it. There is a lot of investment in Middle East, there is a lot of investment in Asia, there is still plenty of opportunity in the U.S. driven by the Tier 3 and ISA 84. Overall, I think we\u2019ll have a terrific position in those businesses. And the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made have increased our potential across the globe. If you look just at the compliance related stuff, we still see greater than $20 billion worth of potential projects out there. They\u2019ve been a little slow to show up, but we think they are going to be significant for us and we\u2019re clearly one of the better positioned companies to support that compliance and safety driven work. Moving on now to oil and gas, it\u2019s a very strong market globally. We\u2019re beginning to get pretty good traction in the pipeline services business. We\u2019re also starting to see a fair amount of work in what we would be characterized as midstream infrastructure. Plenty of prospects out there, so the onshore gas business in particular is an area where there is real opportunity and continuing potential growth for Jacobs. Right now that\u2019s offsetting what it remains as I mentioned earlier pretty weak oil sands business. Our strategy to deal with that is to come up with some new approaches, the change that capital efficiency equation in the oil sands and we think we can do that it will bode well for our business in spite of the overall weak market. Finally moving on to the chemicals business, lots of FEED and pre-FEED activity out there. It\u2019s all unconventional gas driven FEED gas is the word of the day. We\u2019ve got a great chemicals resume and an ability to deliver globally I think that\u2019s a strength. But, everybody remains very measured in releasing these projects. And frankly, I think that\u2019s going to continue for a while I don\u2019t believe the industry is as optimistic about the prospect for chemicals as perhaps the general market thinks it should be, so we\u2019re going to see very slow and steady releases of project. I think the work is coming, but it\u2019s not coming fast. Moving on now to Slide 13, we\u2019ve been very successful with acquisitions, we continue to believe acquisitions are important part of our growth strategy. In the near-term, we\u2019re going to be very focused. We\u2019ve pointed out the key markets upstream and telecom and largely our North America strategy for those and that\u2019s going to continue to be our focus. We may find any occasional small niche acquisitions that\u2019s a tuck-in to support our business, but by and large our main focus will be on upstream and telecom and I think for the most part they\u2019ll tend to be smaller acquisitions rather than larger. Moving on now to Slide 14, kind of our commercial, it\u2019s a good company and it\u2019s got a really good story. I think the relationship-based business model speaks for itself 97% repeat business is pretty special. We continue to show that our diversification is the strength and if you can look to the backlog growth in the national governments and buildings and infrastructure business and see how that\u2019s working, we\u2019ve got a great balance sheet, and a strong cash position that lets us grow. And then we\u2019ve got a cost position that keeps us in a strong competitive position. So I think there are a number of arguments, why we continue to be a good choice in this industry. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike and we\u2019ll listen to your questions, try even answering them. Question: and: Operator :  Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First we have Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets :  And I\u2019d like to start by just thanking Mr. Prosser for all his help and guidance, since I\u2019ve started in this sector in '03. I\u2019m going to miss you very much and I look forward to saying goodbye in person soon. So first question is just in regards to \u2013 Craig, if I look at your comments around upstream and telecom so it really - more so the shale and telecom markets you\u2019ve just gotten into, clearly you some sort of macro skittishness around that recently given where oil prices are going on the shale side and on the telecom side, we saw AT&T really coming down and notching down some of its CapEx on the wireless side, seems you\u2019re still optimistic and upbeat about these markets, so would love to get your thoughts on why that\u2019s the case? Craig Martin :  Sure, let me start with the unconventional gas side. I think the unconventional gas is a two-story marketplace. If you have dry gas, it\u2019s not a very attractive business right now. Cost of production is probably higher than the value of the gas once it\u2019s produced. If you have wet gas, so if you\u2019ve got a lot of liquids in your gas, it\u2019s still extremely attractive. And so what we\u2019re seeing is a concentration of investment in those areas that have the good combination of both gas and liquids. The good news about all that is, there\u2019s still lots of that and so it continues even in these lower oil price markets to be a very attractive investment for our customers and we continue to see lots of activity there. Moreover, it\u2019s still a business that\u2019s largely populated by small contractors and small engineering companies. And so our ability to displace those companies and bring a broader and more geographically distributed solution to our customers is driving opportunities for us to replace those small as they\u2019re often called mom and pop operations with a greater and more efficient Jacobs\u2019 operation. So, I continue to be very optimistic, I don\u2019t think a $75 plus or minus oil price has any impact, when you have both the liquids and the gas and dry gas is kind of just not a workable area right now. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at on all that. And with respect to telecom, again it\u2019s a big business globally and we continue to have a small share, so a part of my optimism about telecom is just taking share from other players in the industry who can\u2019t do the work quite as efficiently or quite as safely as we\u2019re able to do it. And I think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for us for growth in that regard in spite of AT&T\u2019s pullback, I think you can see from our press releases, we\u2019ve been awarded a couple of nice chunks of work including a chunk from AT&T. So for us at least that continues to be a growing business and we continue to be very upbeat about the three year, five year billion dollar business kind of prospects that the telecom business represents. Did I answer your question Tahira? Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Yes, you did Craig, thank you, and as a follow-up on the positive side, you talked a bit about the Middle East opportunities going up, would love to get a sense how it seems the Qatar World cup is back on if that helps. And number two on the buildings side you talked about some positive bookings post the quarter? Would love some color on those as well. Craig Martin :  Let me start with Qatar just because that's -- we have talked about the rail program that we\u2019re involved in. We have two major sections of the Qatar Metro Rail. We continue to get awards in Qatar that support the World Cup and all the things that Qatar is trying to do. So that's a very good business market for us as is the most of the rest of the Middle East. We have this strong base now of oil and gas capability and presence and relationship and we\u2019re being able to leverage that into a broader infrastructure and buildings portfolio. I can't give you any details on the awards that I was talking about earlier because we don\u2019t have permission from the clients to talk about them. But I think they are relatively big programs in which we are going to have a significant role. So as soon as we can press release those, I can give more color. I think there is much more of that kind of work to come, the investment in the Middle East in buildings and infrastructure is significant. And it's one of those areas where there has been an underinvestment up to now. So I expect we are going to see as various governments in the Middle East try to deal with the populous, the transportation issues, the lack of infrastructure in some cases, that's going to continue to be a big area of investment and I expect us to benefit differentially as a result of that. Does that help? Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Yes, it does, thank you very much. Operator :  Next we have Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse Andrew Buscaglia - Credit Suisse :  Hey, guys this Andrew on behalf of Jamie and good quarter and congrats to Mr. Prosser. John Prosser :  Thank you. Andrew Buscaglia - Credit Suisse : So just looking at your model and your guidance so far, I mean so you got Q1 coming down a bit seasonally it seems, but what gives you confidence in potentially achieving even the high-end of that your guidance range at 3.85 just seems that given where backlog is specifically with field services being a little bit more lukewarm recently, is there anything that you think could drive upside or that you have in mind that might push that earnings higher towards that 3.85? Craig Martin : Well, as you know we don\u2019t give guidance within guidance but overall when we look at the markets we serve and in particular when we look at the balance of market between the industrial, the process and the public and institutional market, there is enough activity in those markets that we see decent growth in all three. And this is one of those businesses I think we've often talked over the years that it's like an 8-cylinder engine, I think it's more like nine or 10 now but it's like an 8-cylinder engine and if we can get five cylinders hitting well we can grow really-really well. And I think that potential is out there. When I look at micro trends, like what's happening to billable hours, those micro trends are also positive. So I think the guidance range is realistic but we will have to see how it all goes as the quarters unfold. Andrew Buscaglia - Credit Suisse : And then just back on that field services, I mean the revenues there were a little bit disappointing this quarter I think. And then the last couple of quarters, they have been sort of the same. I mean what do you see in that specific segment as it pertains to potentially picking up anytime sooner and is there anything out there that you think you might see a turnaround in '15 to drive those revenues a little bit higher? Craig Martin : Absolutely, I think there is two key areas to think about. And probably the most significant one is getting project out of FEED and getting them released to execute. We've got probably as much FEED business in the company right now in the process industries as we've ever had. But at this point it continues to just be FEED work. And the leverage, particularly the leverage for field services is in the execute phase. So probably the top of my list in terms of what will drive that expansion in field services is getting these projects released through the final investment decision into execute. We've got a number of customers who are talking about those kinds of things happening in the next two or three months, but frankly I've heard that story before. So that's clearly the number one question is when we get releases on the projects that are already in-house because that will have the biggest single impact on field services. The other has to do with what the turnaround situation is going to be in the spring. And right now, the turnaround situation is pretty unclear; it's a particularly important issue up in Canada. So it's hard for us to see just at this point in time what's going to happen in turnaround and what's going to drive our construction presence in Canada. If the turnaround season is good and it very well could be, that will also have a very strong impact on the last couple of quarters of the year. If it is a weak turnaround season, obviously that will be a bit of a drag on the number. Operator :  Next we have Sameer Rathod of Macquarie. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research :  Can you tell us what the final goodwill allocation for SKM was since the K was announced and comment why goodwill continues to be written up every quarter since the transaction? John Prosser : Well, I think the goodwill, obviously numbers will be indicating and that should be released before the end of the week. And as you go through the process of any acquisition you evaluate goodwill for about a 12 months period after the acquisition and look at that quarter-by-quarter and re-estimate it. We are approaching that 12 month period. So this last quarter we\u2019ve taken and because it was the year-end we\u2019ve taken another real strong look at it and such so you get a judgment for things that have changed, both on project side and other expenses and such that come through. So I don\u2019t think you will see much change going forward particularly related to SKM, but we do as other acquisitions we\u2019ve made this year while smaller then we\u2019ll still go through that process. Craig Martin : One thing to be clear about it, we do not write projects up to market. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research : Okay, I guess that wasn\u2019t my question, I was just curious. Craig Martin : We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good practice, and so we haven\u2019t done it, and that will continue to be our approach. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research : Okay, I guess my next question is, in your last filing which was Q3 you stated that goodwill associated with SKM will be tax deductible, which if I am correct is new language compared to prior acquisitions Jacob has done. So is that kind of a thing that you are expecting goodwill charge in the future or could you explain that language in the last filing? Craig Martin : It always depends on the circumstances and how we\u2019ve written it up and such like that, because with SKM we could do 338 election and such we get tax benefits against the dividend payments out. We are doing it a fairly complex tax and in some cases we have that some cases we don\u2019t, but depending on where acquisitions are done and forms of the acquisitions and such like that. It doesn\u2019t have a future impact it just means that we can tax benefit it as we book the goodwill. Operator :  Luke Folta, Jefferies. Luke Folta - Jefferies:  First question I had was just on the restructuring. You\u2019ve had pretty significant charges this year. Is this the end of the charges you think going forward, and can you talk about when you look at your 2015 outlook what the implied benefit of cost savings associated with the restructuring is? Craig Martin : Well, let me answer the first part of your question. The restructuring that we did is done. We have charges every quarter for closing offices, and adjusting staff depending on the workload, but we consider all those things to be a normal part of business, we don\u2019t break them out. And we\u2019ll have those charges going forward, but they will just be in the noise. So the restructuring charges as we have described in the last few quarters that\u2019s it. And so everything is done that we\u2019re going to do in that way. The benefit of those charges is spread out over a number of years. It\u2019s about half lease related so that is a fairly long tail, about half staff related and even that has a long tail in some cases. So you are going to see the benefit of that over the next few years as the business continues to grow. You will also see the benefit of it in the form of, while it\u2019s lower G&A the competitive position of the firm is such that we may see some of that come back and go away I should say in the form of lower selling prices in this very competitive market, and our ability to maintain that margin. So, I think restructuring was a smart thing for us to have done and I think it does put us in a great position from a competitive point of view and I think we\u2019re seeing some benefit of that. I think you will see in the G&A numbers as we go forward some benefit of that, but again not going to give guidance within guidance, so that\u2019s really as much as I can say on the subject, John you have a comment? John Prosser :  No, well that was just it. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Well I guess without giving specific guidance on next year are you able to talk about what you think maybe the total magnitude of the long-term cost savings could have been? Craig Martin : We\u2019ll get significantly more than the value of the charges over the life of that restructuring. So I think in general, leases are dollar-per-dollar but labor savings have a multiplier effect and so we\u2019ll see more than the value of the charges come back to the shareholders over the next three or four years. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Okay. Alright, and then I guess just on share buybacks, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s historically been a big part of your capital allocation and obviously there is the upgradation that was announced since last quarter. Can you, John may be just talk about what your thoughts are in terms of what the magnitude of what you could do on this part, could be going forward and in terms of how you think about is more of an opportunistic thing or is this something that you are going to include sort of in the long-term allocation strategy? John Prosser :  As you\u2019re aware the authorization is a $500 million buyback over three years. So we have said that we\u2019re going to be opportunistic as I said we\u2019ve bought 1.5 million shares in the month of September so that doesn\u2019t have a big impact on EPS essentially that in the quarter because of the way it is, how you figure weighted average shares it\u2019s a nice start going forward and certainly well above to have a pro rata buyback stream. I think we\u2019ll continue to look and be active and looking for opportunities to buy that back my expectation would be particularly right now with the period where we don\u2019t see a lot of larger acquisitions than we may be a little more aggressive on the buyback than just we might on a steady state basis. So I think that you\u2019ll see probably that won\u2019t last five year and three years and if the opportunity is still there it will get extended to and we\u2019ll just have to play that by year, but I think given where we are our continued ability to generate good cash flow the focus right now on probably relatively small midsized acquisitions as opposed to any large acquisitions that is just another arrow in our quiver of use of capital and that is one that we haven\u2019t use for a long time. I think last buyback was back in the late 80s and but as we\u2019ve focused more on the acquisition side and have done a larger acquisitions relative to what we normally would do. But I think given the strength of our balance sheet and what we believe to be a well stock price relative to our future outlook but certainly now is an opportune time to be having the buyback ability and executing on. Operator :  Next we have Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs : Can you gentleman talk about the M&A pipeline at this point and John if you could just orient us on how we should be thinking about the balance sheet from here. Should we look for you to pay down some of the debt before you get aggressive on the M&A side I am just curious what your assessment is on bid ask and evaluations on potential acquisitions? John Prosser : I think as I just said the pipeline is more focused a couple of areas in the upstream and in telecom business those are where we\u2019re really focusing on as consolidation and kind of a roll up I hate to use that word but activity a lot of smaller fragmented marketplaces there. I think from a balance sheet standpoint we\u2019re pretty close to net zero on debt and we\u2019ve got $800 million of debt and $730 million of cash. So our balance sheet is in good position we have excess cash we pay down the debt because it\u2019s all revolving debt and that cash is still available to us we\u2019ll use some of it for buybacks. As the opportunity is there and we\u2019ll also you probably see us doing a number of those small midsize acquisitions none of those are mutually exclusive and we all have to pay down debt I mean certainly the well of debt we\u2019re at right now is very sustainable and if we have opportunities for cash elsewhere we\u2019ll use it for that if not we\u2019ll pay down debt and have it available for when we need it. Craig Martin : Just to amplify on that a little bit Jerry when I look at the acquisition that we have in discussion there is nothing today that I see as that\u2019s a significant and a big number kind of deal. And I would consider anything about maybe $500 million to be a big number kind of deal. So there we are really not looking at anything like that at the moment not to say something wouldn\u2019t come along but that\u2019s not something we\u2019re seeing right now. There are lots of eagles in size deals out there that we\u2019re looking at, largely to support our upstream and telecom businesses and I think we\u2019ll see and then like I said it will be these niche acquisitions from time-to-time that will be very small numbers kind of in the noise frankly from a cash flow point of view. So I think as we sit here today we\u2019re going to continue to generate good cash flow and we\u2019ll have some acquisition used for that but we\u2019ll have other uses for it as well. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs :  And on the backlog can you just talk about the drivers of the backlog decline in process? What particular end-markets drove that and maybe touch on where there any major projects within public and the institutional where you saw really significant backlog growth, any really meaningful parts of that growth that we should outline? Craig Martin :  Let me touch one two different aspects. In the process area, the big weaknesses were field services work up in Canada, where the -- as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier the outlook for turnaround work in the second half of the year is very uncertain. And so that was the pretty significant factor in the numbers and there\u2019s I mentioned, we have one major project cancellation in the U.S. Gulf Coast and that was a pretty significant factor in changing the process number. So those are really part of the important drivers in the process numbers overall. On the public and institutional side, amidst the acquisition we talked about FNS. We were able to book a couple of very large new scope work for that business and so that was a nice positive for that. It doesn\u2019t account for the bulk of the number, but there were some substantial additions to backlog because the business of supporting the intelligence community which we told that we were really positive about is proving to be as every bid as positive as we hoped. So those are probably the highlights without getting -- and I can\u2019t really get more specific on that. Operator :  Next we\u2019ve Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays. Alan Fleming - Barclays:  It\u2019s Alan Fleming in for Andy. John congratulations on the retirement and good luck. Craig maybe taking a step back and asking a little bit of a broader question, where do you think we are in the current E&C cycle and how much has the recent volatility in oil prices impacted your views on maybe the sustainability of this cycle? It seems like more investors we talk to, either believe this cycle is ending or is significantly stalled here, and so I\u2019d be very curious to how you respond to those types of comments? Craig Martin :  Well, I think to the extent that oil prices are a key driver. We should expect oil prices to remain low throughout \u201815. I don\u2019t mean low like $20 I mean low like where they are right now. And I do think that will make -- that will have some impact on investment decisions and where they\u2019re made. Certainly, without pipeline capacity to Canada that\u2019s going to impact the oil sand pretty significantly. Fundamentally, their new investments doesn\u2019t make any sense at these kinds of oil prices and particularly with the capacity constraints that they have in terms of getting the [indiscernible] in the market. So I think it\u2019s going to impact that business, I think though more globally, I think the impacts are probably less significant. So for example, if you look at the Middle-East, they\u2019ve made the decision to continue to produce and let the price of oil come down. There\u2019s a lot of interest particularly in Saudi Arabia in making sure that the social infrastructure and [soluziation] takes place and I think as a result that there is going to be continued investment in-spite of the lower oil price in that part of the world. So I think you\u2019re going to see for lack of a better word sort of geographically area limited impacts on investments. So Canada probably down a bit, Middle-East still very strong, Gulf Coast frankly I think will continue to be very strong, Singapore pretty strong just because it\u2019s in a terrific logistic position. I think Western Australia on the oil and gas side, probably we\u2019re going to see the investment taper-off for a while, frankly there\u2019s been a lot of maybe what -- maybe over investment in that part of the world and I think it\u2019s going to be a challenging time till it sorts itself out.  So I think what\u2019s happening is not going to have a uninform impact across the global business. I think it will make customers even more cautious about the timing of their investments and when they make investment decisions, part of what we are reflecting in our outlook for \u201815 is a slower environment in terms of releasing projects, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an end-of-cycle conversation. So I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re at that stage where everybody says okay, we\u2019re at the end of the cycle and now we\u2019re going to have a prolonged downturn. Generally, when our businesses are booming the cycles already over. And we\u2019re not anywhere near that blooming stage yet. So I think what we may have is more like that a stagflation kind of growth. And I don\u2019t mean that in the economic terms of that, I mean in the sense that growth is going to be slower than a normal up-cycle, but we\u2019re going to continue to see an up-cycle. And that\u2019s kind of where as best I can see it right now things are likely to go. John Prosser :  And I\u2019m going to play economist here a little bit, which is really-really dangerous. But the impact of lower oil and gas prices will have some positive impact on some of the economies as people get more spendable cash because they are not playing for gasoline and going into the winter for fuel oil and things like that, so you could see sort of little bit of stimulus on some of our other markets particularly the public sector and things like that, it could be balancing it. Craig Martin : Yes normally in the refining area for us, what we generally find in these situations is that lower oil prices don\u2019t get reflected at the pump as fast as you might expect and therefore cash flow goes up for refiners and refiners like to spend cash flow on expanding plants and doing upgrades and retrofit. So I actually think the lower gas prices or lower oil prices may will be a positive for our refining business, at least in the next year or two. Alan Fleming - Barclays: I think I appreciate the robust response. Maybe a related follow up to that, can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment generally in your end markets? So I think last quarter you had said that you weren't seeing any areas in the market where you could get significant improvements in price. So is that still true, I think you had mentioned previously on this call about some increase in billable hours. But can you talk about that and how concerned do we have to be that pricing could get materially worse for you guys in '15 especially if we see some of this stagnation growth that you talked about. Craig Martin : I think pricing is -- all of our businesses with one or two acceptance continue to be very competitive. As you look around the globe, the overall level of investment is not robust outside of maybe oil and gas and as a result competition is up and pricing is aggressive to say the least. We -- as I think I mentioned at last quarter, we had seen and had continued -- and do continue to see a very faint uptick in pricing, but I\u2019m talking about 5 basis points a quarter kind of uptick, not very much at all. And I think that's the best outlook as we go forward is about that, not much. I don't really see a collapse of pricing, I don't see a slowing back to the 2010 sort of pricing. I think there is an up work and there are -- there is enough activity that things won\u2019t get quite that desperate, but I do think that looking for margin expansion in '15 is probably not the right strategy. We are certainly not basing our outlook on significant margin expansion. Operator :  Next we have Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank : Hi, this is Chad Dillard on the line for Vishal, thanks for taking for my question. So just given the backdrop of oil prices and where they are right now and what you are seeing in your project pipeline. Do you think you can grow backlog in 2015 and to what extend do you think it will be driven by organic growth? Craig Martin :  I think we can grow backlog well in 2015. I would expect we would be able to grow it in the 8% to 12% sort of range backlog growth which would be pretty consistent with what our expectations are for growth overall. I think that it's to a limited extent dependent on the things I've already described in this call in terms of how and when that happens, but I fully expect to see our backlog grow in '15. And I continue -- and I believe it will continue to grow into '16 and beyond.  I think the mix for us will be pretty much across the Board. I expect recovery and the process industries from the drop off you saw in this quarter and I expect our other businesses to continue to be good. And I think the recovery in the minerals market and the PharmaBio business both bode well for growth in that backlog and I think you can see we are doing very well in the national government's buildings and infrastructure business growing backlog as well.  So I don't know if I've answered your question, but we are I think pretty optimistic about our ability to grow backlog in '15. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank : That was very helpful. And then turning to the chemical side, now that some of the crackers have moved forward into construction, our greater focus has been placed on, on the derivatives market. And I was just curious to get a sense how do you see the cadence of UPC awards being build out going forward? Craig Martin : I've got George Kunberger here who is our head of sales and I am going to ask George to response to that. George Kunberger :  So I think that as you well know our derivative capabilities both domestically and globally is very strong from a capabilities perspective. From an opportunity to turn new things and convert them into the ECC deliveries. We are starting to see signs that those opportunities are starting to present themselves in a reasonably significant way. I mean still what Craig said really about the cautiousness of with which people spend money and make decisions is, is there in it. That's driven by a couple of factors, it's driven just by the overall market conditions but it's also driven by the potential escalation of cost of capital in the project itself. So though really there is two factors that these clients look at when they try to make those decisions. So overall market versus for themselves and then what's happening to the cost of capital just as escalation happens with demand on construction, construction resource, et cetera.  But despite all that, I mean I am certainly starting to see and I can't obviously talk about it. Prospects on our list that will I believe pretty soon turn into EPC opportunities for Jacobs in the derivatives and related derivatives marketplace in the U.S. particularly. Craig Martin : Thanks George. Operator : Next we have Robert Connors location of Stifel. Robert Connors - Stifel: Hello guys, can you hear me? Craig Martin : Yes. Robert Connors - Stifel: Okay, if I just look back to past three years, I saw that the published data the chemical spending component has been the fastest sector on the non-res construction side in the U.S. So I guess stepping back, is there something about this market or maybe the Jacob\u2019s relations model versus more of the transactional model is keeping you guys from booking some of these larger awards. Because I hear that from you guys, contractors tend to be a little bit more mom-n-pop and maybe the size of the projects are little -- coming from the smaller balance sheet. So I am just wondering if the model still applies in this sort of market. Craig Martin : It very much applies in this sort of market. Our relationship based model is frankly very effective in the chemicals business, and we continue to show growth in that business overall. I think the challenges are that we are not really out there chasing what are called [marque] process. We are not in the ethylene side of the business at all, so growth in the ethylene side of business isn\u2019t going to impact us very significantly until it starts to be the derivative aspect that we were just talking about.  A lot of our chemicals work is at smaller cap plant maintenance operations level. And so again no big numbers there, just slow steady growth as we expand our share of that marketplace. So I think the challenge is that we are not focused on -- to the same extent perhaps some of our other public sector competitors are on the giant events. And we\u2019ve had a number of nice awards in the chemicals business, we continue to have a nice chunk of our backlog in the chemicals business but it\u2019s not the high visibility stuff that you think of when you see a Fluor or perhaps CB&I. Does that help? Robert Connors - Stifel: Yeah, that helps. And then just-- John Prosser : And one other comment. If you look at our growth in the chemicals industry over the last four or five years it\u2019s been fairly significant as well and it\u2019s been more on the side of the smaller existing plants as they\u2019ve been upgraded and they\u2019ve been brought back on to production as opposed to the big new builds. And so as we roll through this we will start getting some of the derivatives on the new builds and that\u2019s just will even be more positive for us. Robert Connors - Stifel: Okay, and then you guys have a number of as far as if you are able to transition a lot of that feed work into field services, what the potential pull-through could be? Craig Martin : We hasn\u2019t sat down and tried to create a number like that, so I can\u2019t answer that question. I am going to go look after this call though. Robert Connors - Stifel: And then, I guess just one more quick one. Do you guys expect that TPS to stay relatively flat here 58% of the mix? Craig Martin : I think in the short term yes, in the longer term I think still expect that as these jobs going to execute the field services proportion of the total will go up and TPS will drop from a 58% range back down into the low 50s, maybe even little lower depending on how much of that work actually goes out as EPC. Robert Connors - Stifel: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator :  The next question we have comes from the location of Andy Wittmann of Baird. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird:  Hey guys thanks for taking my questions, I had a couple of just kind of quick technical ones to start out with. John can you give us the amount of revenue that was from acquisitions that contributed in the quarter? John Prosser : Actually I don\u2019t have that right here in front of me. FNS is relatively small, they wouldn\u2019t have had a big impact for the quarter, I don\u2019t think. So really only the SKM which is been running about 250 million a quarter. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird: Thank you. And John on the miscellaneous line on the income statement there was a little bit elevation this quarter about $6.8 million. Could you give us some help with what that was? John Prosser : We actually sold piece of real-estate in India. That it\u2019s been leased out so actually we have been getting revenue off of it -- income off of it in the form of lease payments and such, it was excess so we sold it, it\u2019s been on the market for actually couple of quarters, just closed this quarter. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird: That\u2019s helpful. And then just under restructuring charges of $36 million, can you give us a sense so we have better understanding where the -- maybe the underlying margins were. Was that all in the SG&A line or can you give us a split between gross margin and SG&A where that was? John Prosser : It would evolve then in the SG&A line. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird: Great. John Prosser : I take that back. There is a little bit that was going into cost of sales in the form of unbilled and stuff like that, but the vast majority of it was in G&A. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then just as you look at the guidance and knowing that you did some restructuring actions to adjust the cost structure, I guess maybe the way to ask this is? How much for the EPS growth is due to taking under utilization from last year and then having it better utilized whether that billable hours or real estate. How much of that EPS growth is really purely as a result of mechanic of taking cost of the business? John Prosser : We\u2019re not going to give guidance within guidance as we\u2019ve said and we\u2019re not breaking it down specifically, but that\u2019s certainly is in there just like the impact of continuous stock buyback as considered in that range and growth in the business because as Craig said we\u2019re also seeing a pick up in the hours -- the billable hours being worked, so that\u2019s in there as well. So we\u2019re not going to break down as to how much of the guidance is related to each. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird: In that you mentioned the buyback, did you say -- is there incremental buyback associated that has not yet been completed as contemplated in that guidance range or would buyback from here be incremental for the guidance. I think you kind of touched on there on your answer, I wanted to make if we understood that correctly. John Prosser : Well, we\u2019re going to be keep doing the buyback opportunistically. So the idea of the buyback is included in the range, it wouldn\u2019t be incremental at the top end of the range or incremental at the bottom is just going -- based on what we think is we\u2019re going to be able to do based on a stock price so its factored into the range of the guidance. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird: Got it and then may be Craig maybe a little bit surprise in some of just have a cancellation on a Gulf Coast energy related project. Can you just talk about what some of the drivers may have been with that one or it does anything to read into it for the market as a whole, if it just one-off? I think some color would be helpful there. Craig Martin :  Well I don\u2019t know that is a one off I certainly would not say that. I can\u2019t tell you much about it because the customer wouldn\u2019t appreciate my sharing about a lot of detail. But fundamentally the cost of the project was high enough that the economics didn\u2019t make sense. And the so the return on investment was in adequate to justify going forward with the project. This is the issue that I\u2019ve been raising for some time now about why the customer are being so cautious and why there is this recycling of feeds to try to get give the costs forecast down to the plus zero, minus ten kind of range even though that really can\u2019t be done. These customer are very, very sensitive whether the investment return that there committed to are actually going to be achieved and there are all coming off experiences from the 2005 to 2008 time frame where those things weren\u2019t achieved because costs over ran significantly its lots and lots, lots project around the globe and so there is very strong level of caution. And occasionally I think that\u2019s going to result in projects getting cancelled and where the number just doesn\u2019t work for the customer and therefore the job doesn\u2019t go forward. If you talk about the dark side of our outlook going forward that certainly it. George you want to comment? George Kunberger : This is George. Just to elaborate a little bit on the question knowing Craig\u2019s answer, a lot of times within these larger organization it\u2019s not so much that the project by itself does not pencil-out it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t pencil-out relative to a lot of the other opportunities that the clients have to spend cash around the world. So that\u2019s not a universal statement, but that often the case, there is a lot of competing opportunities all around the world as we all know and the chemical and the hydro carbon stage is well known. And so if you\u2019re looking at some of these big Companies, looking where to put the cash their, its more competing return on investment not just at any particular return investment is not attractive. Craig Martin : That being said that wasn\u2019t the case for cancellation I just mentioned. Andy Wittmann - Robert W. Baird: Thanks for all the color there. Operator :  Next we have a question from the location of Steven Fisher, UBS. Steven Fisher - UBS:  Great thanks good morning. In terms of your cash flow expectations for 2015 is there any reason to assume that free cash flow won\u2019t exceed net income next year. I am assuming that depreciation and amortization should be above CapEx, is that the right way to think about it? Craig Martin : Yes I think that we\u2019ve always said that we should be able to convert our bottom-lines into cash and that depreciation kind of offset from the CapEx and things like that, so I think certainly that would our expectation if you look at -- you see the number for this year, I think we\u2019ve had -- this year was the year\u2019s been a little bit below that, but I think going forward that would certainly be my expectation that we should be able to have good strong cash flow. Steven Fisher - UBS: Okay great and then Craig you give us some color on the process industry I think around the world maybe can you speak about the business and its entirety in terms of your growth expectations by region in organically or an aggregate. Craig Martin : Sure let me try to work my way around that. North America good growth in the U.S. Probably one of our better growth markets frankly, weak or no growth in Canada, South America is still for us pretty much our mining and minerals dependent marketplace. We\u2019re doing a good job of capturing share in the small cap in the world, but to see real significant growth there we\u2019ve got to see some bigger projects get going. And I think that\u2019s probably a late \u201815 sort of timeframe. There might be a little activity between now and then, but not a bunch. Europe\u2019s going to be very slow, there\u2019ll be some projects specific opportunities for growth, but overall it\u2019s kind of a waste land from an economic growth point of view and a waste land in terms of return on investment of new projects and program.  So we see Europe as largely a maintenance capital, there\u2019s a ton of investment there that\u2019s got to be maintained, but we don\u2019t expect to see a whole lot of new investment in Europe. Middle-East it\u2019ll be continuing to be very hot, as we expand the services and the markets that we serve. I expect to see really good growth in Middle-East. Africa will be pretty slow from a growth standpoint, we have a huge position in North Africa with Morocco and OCP. I don\u2019t expect that to get much bigger in the near-term, but it will continue to be a very strong business for us. South Africa probably not a lot of expansion there and certainly not enough to move the needle in anyway, so Africa will be flat to zero kind of growth. India will be a big growth opportunity for us next year, both in terms of foreign direct investment in India, investment by Indian customers, India and our high value engineering center. I expect our high value engineering center particularly show really dramatic growth in the next 12 months.  Moving onto Asia. China, Singapore, Malaysia all three look like they\u2019re going to have good but not great growth next year. So I think that\u2019ll be a positive story. Australia is going to be a tale of two different aspects, I think our buildings and an infrastructure sort of public and institutional business is going to show really good growth. I think the mining and minerals get oil and gas process industry and end up processing industrial stuff probably pretty slow. Overall though I think we\u2019ll see some single-digit kind of growth out of Australia. So I don\u2019t think I left anywhere out. Did I? Steven Fisher - UBS: No, I think you hit them all. Thank you very much. Operator :  The next question we have comes from the location of Justin Ward, Wells Fargo. Justin Ward - Wells Fargo :  John a quick congrats and wish you an excellent retirement. I\u2019ll speak-in a couple of quick one, just on the revenue growth in the quarter, we saw continued year-over-year moderation there, I mean it was up 2% and versus up 5 in Q3 and up 12 in Q2. In Q3 a lot of the drag really came from Pharma and Biotech and industrial other segments those are pretty weak year-over-year, was there any concentrated weakness this quarter revenue growth on year-over-year basis that you guys can call out or? John Prosser :  Well I think if you look at the revenue for mining and minerals, it was down as a percentage of the total, even though revenue was up in the aggregate. We continue to come off big project work in the mining and minerals segment and replacing it with a good profitability line in terms of small project capital and maintenance kinds of engineering services. They just don\u2019t carry the revenue right, it\u2019s a service-only aspect of business whereas big mining and minerals construction carries a ton of revenue with it. So that\u2019s probably the one place I can point to where there is a significant swing from quarter to quarter and that\u2019s really been happening to us all year. Justin Ward - Wells Fargo :  And then just one more on the growth, is there any sense -- you guys have done a lot of restructuring last couple of quarters, is there any sense to your trading maybe some revenue growth in the near-term for margin there, as you spend less from the SG&A line? John Prosser :  We\u2019ve been very careful to focus our restructuring on eliminating excess office space that\u2019s unoccupied on dealing with historic operations that where we don\u2019t believe the growth potentials there. And refocusing our energy where we do believe there\u2019s growth, so I\u2019d say if anything just the opposite, I think the energy we put into restructuring makes us a stronger and more focused organization going forward. And I would expect that to produce better result. Justin Ward - Wells Fargo :  And I guess, I don\u2019t know if I can get you to come on this, but it seems as if, if we kind of back into the organic growth rate in the quarter is kind of that maybe down mid-single digits. Is there any sense that, there\u2019s maybe inflection point in that organic growth rate and we may see that to start to go back toward positive or? Craig Martin :  Well I certainly expect organic growth to be almost all of our growth in \u201815 and a substantial part of our growth in \u201816. So in the grand scheme of things we\u2019re not expecting much growth from acquisitions partly because we\u2019re not going to make much, we don\u2019t think, in the way of acquisitions in \u201815 and probably into some part of \u201816. So I think we\u2019re very focused at this stage on driving organic growth. We've got some really good acquisitions in the company and I think we have the opportunity to leverage those very aggressively for organic growth as well. Operator :  [Operator Instructions]. Next we have John Rogers' location of D. A. Davidson. John Rogers - D. A. Davidson:  I guess the question I have is Craig as you look at your business now between TPS and field services, how much of the work do you end up or do you think the field is flowing through TPS, in other words that you are doing the front-end work on. Craig Martin : It's the vast majority. Exceptions to that are the maintenance business which is probably about 20% of our total field services and that's not an accurate number, it's just a rough estimate. So the maintenance business doesn't have a big TPS component, but the rest of it is pretty TPS related and pretty much again in the public, the private sector side of our business. So Pharma, mining and minerals, heavy process, that's really where TPS drives field services kinds of volume and the vast majority of field service come as a consequence of that fee going into the execute and it be in a full service execution. If you look at the national government side, there is a chunk of field services there that tends to come with a chunk of TPS as its gets awarded, as a lot of our programs and projects in that space have a combination when we win them or when we renew them.  On the buildings and infrastructure side, very little field services ever. For the most part what we see in the field services space there is very unattractive from a risk point of view. So that tends to be TPS only. John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: So I guess I am trying to think about a little bit is that, if we are not seeing work go to field and is indicated that it just seems slower and I\u2019ve heard that from others as well. Are we creating a backup in the TPS backlog that the bookings could materially slow as if you stop studying these projects and just await a decision on whether to go or no go? Craig Martin : We don't generally find that the customers stop spending money while they are thinking about it. In fact, what we generally find John is that they tend to recycle stuff. So what we are seeing is a situation where we go through FEL 3 is the phase that we are generally talking about feed. We get a number or a schedule in a range of outcomes from a plus or minus X percent and the customers go, no that number doesn't work. Let's look at this and then we go and study yet another aspect of the project where we redesign it to eliminate some aspect of the project, something that the customer believes that can do without. And that recycling tends to be what occurs between the onset of feed and the final investment decision. So what really happens is we continue work along kind of steady base load feed work, the final investment decisions is made and assuming it made favorably then we get a big tick up in execute both in the TPS associated doing the engineering and procurement work and in the field services associated with the construction. Now the final investment decisions is that job is no go forward job, then it's pencils down and we got to find work for all those folks that were involved in the feed on some other feed somewhere. And usually at least for now we have been able to do that. And so as long as market has growth then the TPS backlog should be backlog that we can eat and it should be a work that we can continue to expand on. If the market goes south like it did in '09 and '10, then obviously there is a situation where we don't have enough work for the people we have and you are back in the mode of lay-offs and dramatic price cuts and all those kinds of things. So you can't say that's not a possibility but I don't put a lot of likelihood on it right now. John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: Okay. But on the other hand with the extensive TPS backlog that you have now, I presume you've got pretty good visibility at least to that 8% to 12% growth range without significant field services growth to hold it up. Craig Martin : Yes. I think we have a really good visibility in terms of where the business is now. Remember, I think we talked about this many times, about 65% of what we are going to do in FY '15 was in backlog at the end of the September So there is still a lot of selling to do. And if we are unsuccessful at selling or if the market is not there, then we are going to go fall short of our expectation. We don\u2019t see any reason to think that\u2019s true today, but that\u2019s really where the big risk to FY \u201815 results is, is in what\u2019s going to be out there to win and how quickly can you win it and get it in the backlog and execute it. John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: Okay, thank you that\u2019s helpful. Operator :  [Operator Instructions]. At this time we are showing no further questions, we will go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Craig Martin, CEO and President. Mr. Martin? John Prosser : Before Craig wraps-up I just like to thank all of you for the many years that we have worked together and all your support and have enjoyed working with all of you and hopefully will see many of you next week in New York and Boston. Craig Martin :  And with that, I am going to thank you all for joining us. I think we got a great story for \u201915 and I look forward to, like John, look forward to seeing all of you next week. Have a good week. Operator :  And we thank you sir and to the rest of the management team for your time today. The conference call is now concluded. At this time you may disconnect your lines. Thank you again everyone. And have a great day.",

Berryman: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call this morning. Before I kind of dive into some of the financial results, I thought I would spend just a little bit of time and give you some introductory comments given that this is my first earnings call with Jacobs. A couple of notes. Certainly, I'm very excited to be part of the team here at Jacobs, a recognized, leading company in the engineering and construction space. A couple of comments as to why I'm here and why I am excited. During discussions on the on-boarding process with the board and the executive management team, it was very clear to me that this was a team that was collaborative in nature, that it was a very talented team, and that it operated with a very high level of integrity. So certainly, that was very important to me. But of course, that's probably not sufficient for someone to come to the company. There was a little bit more than that. It was very clear to me also during those discussions that the team was very interested and keen on driving an even stronger performance agenda going forward and longer term. I joined this company because I think I can contribute and help drive the development of that performance agenda, which we all collectively believe is going to add significant shareholder value longer term. A couple of comments about some of the changes that are going on in the company. Clearly, there's been some management transition. We're in the midst of a CEO transition. We're in the midst of myself coming onboard after a very talented man, John Prosser, retiring after decades of service to the company. But I thought I'd make some comments as it relates to the company itself and the talent. Certainly, I want to communicate to you, from my perspective, there has been no loss of focus as it relates to what's going on in this company. I think some of that is associated with the talent that's in the company. Certainly, my initial perspective and ideas about the quality of the team has been, if anything, over -- overly confirmed over my first 3-weeks-plus here in the job. And so the talent of the team is clear, and the talent continues to deliver against its execution plan. Also some of that is driven by the leadership of Noel Watson. I've had the pleasure of getting to know Noel over the last few weeks. It's clear that he has a strong pulse on what's going on in the industry, what's going on with the team, and what's going on with our sales initiatives. And I think that he is providing strong leadership in this period of transition for the company. It is clear that this man has much energy. And certainly, probably more energy than the collective energy of the executive vice presidents in the company. So pretty amazing and very much appreciating the opportunity to spend a little bit of time and work with Noel. What does all of that mean? What it means is that traction has not been lost in this company. People are focused, and they are executing. And I'm feeling very good about where we are in this particular point in time. So let me turn to Slide 4. And in honor of Mr. John Prosser, I will use his same slide in terms of the discussion of financial results. In short, I would say the company delivered a very solid quarter. Earnings per share were at $0.77, up 8.5% versus a year ago. I would characterize the quarter as relatively straightforward in that there was no real drivers, pluses or minus, within the context of that, but there were actually some incremental cost headwinds that we realized and were able to overcome during the quarter. Certainly, some of that was associated with foreign exchange, with the strengthening of the dollar over the quarter that had a slight headwind relative to our earnings per share performance and with the executive transition cost, there were some incremental costs. So if you take those costs together, it's probably $0.03. So our $0.77 reported would have been kind of -- given what we knew 3 months ago -- probably would have been closer to $0.80. Regardless of whether it's $0.77 or $0.80, I would say it's very much in line with the expectations that we had set for ourselves at the beginning of the quarter. So all in all, a very solid quarter. Cash flow remains strong in the quarter. Our net debt figure of $80 million remain near year-end levels, and that is driven by the fact that we had $670 million in cash, which largely offset the outstanding debt by the end of the quarter. I think our strong ending cash position really is a tribute and an indication of the evidence of the strength of the cash flow dynamics of the company because this ending debt position was delivered even as our share buyback program ramped up in its level of activity over Q1. During the quarter, we bought back 2.5 million shares at a total value of about $113.7 million. Program-to-date, we have utilized nearly 40% of $500 million authorization and have spent about $192 million. As it relates to what we're doing now, as it relates to our share buyback, you can assume that we are being more aggressive as we speak with our share buyback program given the level of Jacobs' share price that we see today. Relative to backlog, backlog rose to a record $19.1 billion, nearly up 6% from the year-ago period and also up on the $18.4 billion last quarter. I think this is a rather impressive indication of the opportunity for Jacobs, certainly, when noting headwinds in certain of our end markets. It is a testament to the diversity of our company and the ability for it to have and the ability to grow even when market conditions are challenging. In fact, the backlog growth was in spite of several cancellations that we saw all over the quarter, some of which were not inconsequential. Our sales strength then was able to overcome these cancellations, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill for the quarter of over 1.2 and a book-to-bill of 1.8 (sic) [ 1.08 ] for the trailing 12 months. Before I turn to my comments on outlook, perhaps we turn to Slide 5 and talk a little bit about the backlog. Certainly, through the details on the slide, you can see the increase in the backlog was driven by the professional services area, which bodes well for potential future work for the company. Specifically, professional services backlog grew $900 million in the quarter or nearly 7.5% from the year-ago figure. Finally, some thoughts on our outlook. Clearly, there are some headwinds that we are facing in certain parts of our business. We all are hearing about oil and commodity prices. There's no new news here. And consequently, those are real, and those will create some challenges for our company as we work through some of the challenges that our customers face in those respective end markets. That, combined with some FX pressure that we would expect to see over the balance of the year, assuming that the dollar remains strong and at its current levels or maybe even stronger, and the combination of these 2 things results in us being more cautious in our outlook for the year. We believe it is prudent to suggest, therefore, that our outlook is more aligned with the lower half of our previous stated guidance last quarter. However, and nonetheless, diversity remains a strength of this company. It translates into the robust, record backlog that I have previously talked to. Our cautious outlook is therefore more short term in nature, with Q2 impacted probably more than the second half of the year as we work through realignment of our resources from weaker to stronger end-market opportunities. At the same time, it will be important for us to continue to be diligent and disciplined in the management of our fixed cost structure. We need to do this always. It's a hallmark of Jacobs. And it's important that we do that to ensure that we have the right cost structure to be able to operate successfully in any end-market environment. Before turning over the floor to Noel, a few other quick comments. I certainly am looking forward to meeting all of you, our analysts and our shareholders, in the near future as I continue to finalize my on-boarding process. A lot has been going on. No, we haven't had a chance to speak yet, but I look forward to more intimate discussions going forward. And finally, before turning to Noel, a quick thank you to John Prosser, who has been gracious in his support of me during my transition process. I have been able to benefit from his sage counsel, and it certainly is going to make my job going forward much easier. So John, thank you for that. Noel, over to you. Noel G. Watson: Thanks, Kevin. Now why don't we go to Slide 6. And kind of we're going to talk about the relationship-based business model, but we'll do that when we get to 7. Kevin talked to some degree about the market diversity. And most of you know I've been around a long time, and it was many decades ago when we decided -- thank you, we decided in the last real bad downturn in the '80s that it was important to be in more than a single market. So over the decades, we have leveraged our diversity both in a wide variety of end markets that George will talk about, and we have also -- have a geographic spread that really crosses the globe. And so those 2 things we're very thankful for today because we do have headwinds in a couple of markets. When I signed on for the job, I didn't dream I was going to have $45 oil and $2.50 copper, but we do. So it is a fact of life, and we have to deal with it, but many of our markets are very strong right now and George will talk about that. The cash position is good. And by the way, in a market like this, it's a good opportunity to drive down cost, and we're going to have to do that. Now when we get done with that, we move to Slide #7, our relationship-based business model. This slide has been around about as long as I have, and it hasn't changed. And it all starts with our relationship model, our drive to service a smaller group of clients, service them well, know their businesses as well as and better than they do and do outstanding performance for them. And when we get that superior performance that comes with understanding them better than almost anybody else will, we get a continuity of business that is staggering. And the trust it builds, and the repurchase loyalty it builds, the lower-cost G&A sales that go with it is a huge strength for our company. So even though Craig has moved on into retirement, nothing is going to change with the model. So we're putting a lot of effort into steady earnings growth and recapturing the 15% that we talk about over the decades. And with that, I'm going to let George talk a few minutes about market diversity, which is Slide 8. George A. Kunberger: A few minutes, huh? Okay. Well, good morning, everyone. It's George Kunberger. I've met some of you, and I'm delighted to be making my debut here today with my friend Mr. Watson and Kevin. Let's start with Slide #8, which is our diversity slide representation. You've seen this many times before. It's obviously a slide that doesn't change a lot quarter-to-quarter because it's based on a 12-month trailing backlog, so the math just doesn't allow. However, I do want to point out a couple of things. The diversification that it shows on the process side, the number there is about 46%. And for those of you who keep track of these kinds of things, that number was about 48% last quarter on a slightly smaller revenue stream. On the public sector side, that number has increased from about 35% to 37%. That's indicative of a couple of different things. One is the strengthening of public sector market, as Kevin talked about, and a little bit of a headwind impact that we have on the process side, but is more a factor of the fact that as we've evolved over 12 months, it now represents a full 12 months of SKM being in the backlog. And so just the math drives the public institutional side up a little bit. It doesn't necessarily represent the geographic diversification the company has. But as you're well aware, we have the diversification of markets spread out across a wide geographical diversification, so it brings an added value and power through our ability to adjust to these markets. I would say just to -- because I want to use this line. I mean, I've always looked to this picture as a bit of a rose. And it can be a plain rose. But I would say that looking at it through the lens of $45 now oil, it looks pretty darn nice to me right now. So let's move on to Slide #9 and let's talk about these various market sectors. I'd like to start with the public and institutional. As you know, we started showing the backlog within these major market areas down the lower right-hand column. As you can see clearly, the backlog in this particular area grew nicely over this last quarter. That's actually at a rate of about 16% on an annualized basis. I would say this market, I would characterize all of it as being good to strong, both -- and really on a geographical basis. And I'd anticipate looking at our prospect list that this kind of growth will continue on a relatively strong basis throughout the rest of the year, for sure. Going to the individual areas a little bit, I'd like to characterize it like this. All of these areas on this chart, on this page that we have right here, the markets are good to strong in various ways. Just to give you some example. If we look at the defense spending, defense spending has started to stabilize in the U.S. and is ramping up in the U.K. and in Australia. There's some very big programs associated with redeployment of bases in Asia-Pacific, which as you well know, we're very well positioned, both from a relationship perspective, a capability perspective and a geographical perspective to go after it, for sure. If you look at the nuclear cleanup space, that's a growing marketplace both in the U.S. and U.K., and we have a strong resume in both areas and is a marketplace that as you've seen some of our press releases in recent quarters on Sellafield, as an example, we have an opportunity to continue to take advantage of that. The transportation, utility, infrastructure market is good pretty much around the world. There's been a lot of pent-up capacity, as you all know, not only in the U.S. but in the U.K., in the Middle East, Australia, Southeast Asia, really pretty much all around the world. And so while I wouldn't say this is buoyant, off-the-page kind of growth, it is strong, steady growth for sure. Jacobs is well positioned geographically in all of those areas to get after that marketplace. And because of our, I would say, our unique and wonderful business model, as I like to characterize it, we are able to get after that project and move our resources around the world to bring our best resources to bear to capture and bring those -- and capture those marketplaces. In the health care and education, a growth strength, again, not only in the U.S., but everywhere around the world. And then in the area of even like social development, there's a double-sided sword to what's happening in the oil business, and we'll get into the geopolitics of all that. I'm sure you're well aware of them. But you look at the spending that's going on in the Middle East as they try to grow that part of the world on behalf of the citizens of those countries, tremendous amount -- I mean, in the order of $800 billion to $900 billion worth of expenditures planned over the next 5 to 6 years. And again, for the reasons I just articulated, our relationship in that part of the world, along with our capabilities, along with our ability to deliver those resources, really makes it a strong marketplace for us. So overall, I have to say that I'm extremely optimistic about this marketplace. I know it's strong. It's not going to light the world on fire, but it is going to be strong and steady growth as we go through the rest of the year, and I think into the following years as well. So let's go to the next slide, which is what we call our industrial sector or market area, which, of course, has a lot of different factors to it. I'll start with my old favorite, pharmabio. I think as you probably know, there's some exciting things going on in the pharmaceutical word today. New discoveries in the areas of immuno-oncology, which, frankly, are going to make all of us in this room and on this phone call healthy and live longer. There's tremendous discoveries being made there. And of course, that results in real significant capital spending going on, primarily in the Western world, so in the U.S., Ireland, Mainland Europe. And of course, as you well know, Jacobs is a very strong contender in the biological marketplace. And so we're well positioned from a skill set in that perspective. I'll say [ph] pharma companies continue to divest in their distribution of their stable products in developing parts of the world. And as we've discussed many times, we're well positioned to do that. I would say that unlike in the past, the competition is starting to return to this space, to be fair. I guess that they're coming back, away from some of the other marketplaces they've been focusing on for a while. So we are seeing increased competition in this space, which we haven't for a while, but we are capturing more than our fair share of this market space, so that's good. Mining and metals, as Noel articulated, I mean, we are in a depressed commodity situation, and I don't see that necessarily changing for a long time. This marketplace will not be a marketplace that we see much significant growth in over the next couple of years, but that doesn't mean it's not a good marketplace for us. As you well know, we've positioned ourselves to start taking advantage of sustaining capital in this market space around the world. And we're having good success with all the majors in that area, both -- whether it's South America and Australia specifically. Some of the majors who are, frankly, still making money even in this depressed commodity marketplace -- they're not making the money they once made, but they're still making money -- they are starting to at least study potential future expansion projects. It'll obviously -- since it's just in the study phase, it'll be a few years before we really see that translate into major capital expenditures. I mean, overall, the capital expenditure rate in this marketplace is still going down, but it will eventually turn around in a few years out as a result of some of these studies and as the overall global economy changes. So that's good. And then because they're trying to get after better utilization of their spaces, there are a number of key sort of plum projects around the world that are in the brownfield space that are really directed towards improving the utilization of existing assets. And there are a number of those around that we're well positioned to capture, and we're going after those. Pulp and paper and high tech and consumer products. New -- for the newbuild and products in the U.K. continue to be there for us, and we're happy with those. In the area of consumer products, as you well know, those lend themselves to alliance types of relationships. And we are very good at alliances. And those opportunities continue to be available to us around the world. And in the high-tech space, there are a number of key clients. You could just look at who's making money today and who's not and understand that, that's an opportunity for companies like Jacobs to get after it, and we are, for sure. So let's move on to the process world. So obviously, the process world is uncertain, for sure. But uncertain does not make it bad necessarily. Now you really do need to look at the various individual elements of this marketplace to look at it. So let's just start with the upstream, probably the most impacted globally for sure, and let's more importantly look at its impact on Jacobs. Obviously, Canada and the oil sands work is going to be challenged because of the price of oil and the price of getting oil out of oil sands out of the ground up there. But that does not mean that the market has completely disappeared, and that good projects are not going forward, and they are. It's certainly going to be not as strong as it's been for quite some time. In U.S. shale oil business, as you all know, the companies are blowing their horns and moving their resources to where there's more ROI -- as to basins, Permian Basin as an example and the Bakken, but that overall business is shrinking a little bit. But in the midstream, the Middle East and other places in the world, there is still spending going on. Certainly not robust, but not a 0 by any stretch of the imagination. In the refining marketplace, that's a little bit more mixed. There definitely continues to be projects that are focused on improving the overall effectiveness and productivity of individual refineries around the world for some of our major clients. Those projects, some have been delayed and some have not been delayed. Obviously, each one of our clients are going through a lot of examination of their capital expenditures pretty much as we sit here today. But there is still a lot of very good ROI projects in the system associated with refining that are out there, and we're involved in, and we certainly expect them to continue. When you look at areas like ISA 84, which is the process instrumentation-driven safety upgrade. A large amount of money needs to be spent in the billions of dollars over the next few years. We built a strategy in advance to get after this marketplace, and that strategy has translated into some very nice wins already in this quarter. So a very good marketplace for us. And of course, our old sustaining capitalization strategy is always there in these refineries, although we\u2019ll pull back some. We'll need to continue to spend money in the sustaining capital, and we'll be well positioned around the world to get after that. The chemical marketplace, certainly, in our view, remains overall very strong. The impact of the oil prices, the compression of the naphtha price to gas, to natural gas will certainly have some impact on the -- potential impact on the ethane jobs and potential spinoff projects like methanol, et cetera. But overall, the generic chemical marketplace is -- remains very strong in all the areas where Jacobs plays. This has been a market that we have won a number of major projects, some of which we've released, some of which we're not quite free to talk about. And this first quarter has been a big part of the overall sales success that we've had. So I don't see that necessarily changing. There'll be some ups and downs and some starts and stops and projects get reexamined, but overall, that market will be strong for the rest of this year and into the next year. So overall, I'd have to say, I'm pretty darn bullish. And I would just want to point out one other thing. I mean, this growth that we've had over this year -- over this quarter has been completely organic in nature and not impacted by any acquisitions at all and so -- which makes me even more bullish about where we're going. Noel G. Watson: Thanks, George. Go to Slide 12, guys. I keep forgetting to turn the mic on. I apologize. Slide 12 on acquisitions. Well, we have a history of getting about 1/3 of our growth out of acquisitions. And long term, we'll continue to do that. At this point in time, we're slow doing acquisitions. We're digesting what we have. We're focusing on organic growth. And we're going to be harboring our cash for the next big deal. But right now, the acquisitions are basically on hold. But long term, we do need to make acquisitions to get to double-digit growth. Go to Slide 13, and I'll give you the sales pitch. Our model works. It's good. We will continue with it on my watch. All you have to do is see the kind of relationships we got with many big clients and really the successes we had in faraway places like Saudi Arabia, where we have an extremely strong relationship with Aramco. And you can see the model works, and we're not deviating. Our diversification is a godsend right now. Let's not kid ourselves. If we were 100% in oil and gas, we'd be dead. No we're not. And so with the success we've had in some of the businesses, particularly the chemicals George talked about and then on the public and infrastructure businesses, we don't need to have all 8 cylinders working. If we get 5 or 6 out of 8 working, we do just fine. And we have that working today. The balance sheet is good. We will use the current crisis going on with some of our clients to focus on cost advantage. We will be cutting cost. We're not going to do anything draconian, but we are focusing on getting the cost out of the system to make us more competitive, particularly in the heavy process business where that's going to be a necessity. And with that given, I think we're going to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I guess a couple of questions. One, Kevin, you talked about, I think, the second quarter being weaker because you're realigning some resources, et cetera, relative to the second half. So can you talk generally what the cost impact or give more color on how we think about the second quarter versus the first and what your assumptions are for growth in the back half of the year for the acceleration in EPS in the back half of the year? And then I guess my next question is sort of twofold. You guys went through a pretty dramatic restructuring last year. Given the current environment, should we expect something more significant? Can you sort of talk about where you'd be cutting cost? And then I don't know if you can also talk just given the declining crude prices, when you look at your sort of addressable prospect list, how much of that do you think goes away? Noel G. Watson: You take one and I'll take the other one. Kevin C. Berryman: All right, Jamie, nice to hear from you. Just a couple of follow-up comments on your question. As it relates to the Q2 versus the balance of the year, I think it really translates into the fact that with the cancellations, we have to realign our resources, and so there is a short-term pressures, until which time, all of that is in place. The restructuring that was done last year, we've been able to deliver against that, and we have embedded into the results the expectations that we originally had in terms of that. So we're not talking about another substantive restructuring, but we are talking very disciplined, very focused, very targeted opportunities to make sure that we reduce our cost in order for us to be successful in any market environment. And certainly, Noel emphasized that as well. So I think the commentary is more about Q2, which probably indicates that seeing EPS growth versus -- in Q2 versus the balance of the year is more difficult, but we won't give necessarily any guidance specifically by quarter but give you a perspective that year-over-year growth in EPS is more challenging in Q2 versus the balance of the year. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And I'm sorry, just because you brought it up, and then I guess Noel will answer my second question. How big were the cancellations in the quarter and then where were they? I'm assuming it's across oil and gas but if you could just... Noel G. Watson: Yes, they were basically in the oil and gas [ph] process industry, and they're about $400 million out of the revenue stream. Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. I'm sorry, Noel, and then just sort of given -- sorry, my second question, which I know you know. Just how much of the prospect list that was out there? How much do you think sort of goes away? Is it 40% gone, 30%? If you can just sort of give us a feel. Noel G. Watson: I'm going to let George answer that one. He's got better detail than I do. George A. Kunberger: Yes, Jamie, you're talking about specific to the prospect list in the process world, is that the nature of your question? Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Exactly. Exactly. George A. Kunberger: Okay, yes. So certainly, the prospect list for the second quarter and third quarter outlook, which is about as far as we can legitimately see it well, is very robust, as robust as it's ever been. I would characterize it that way. That being said, certainly, even in the last couple of weeks, we've seen a couple of prospects that we had out there that have been postponed for a long time. Those have been in the areas where I was talking about where -- just, say, like methanol or some of the projects that could get postponed as a result of the compression of naphtha prices and natural gas prices. But on the other hand, the secondary chemical marketplace around the world is very strong and continue -- new prospects, new opportunities continue to come onto that list. So yes, certainly in the upstream, a little bit in the midstream and then the refining area, a little bit of pull back, but -- and the chemical is more than offsetting it, at least right now. And we'll see what happens after these -- all these companies announce earnings if either they're going to go after that, but that's certainly where we see it right now. Noel G. Watson: And I think another thing, Jamie, in that area. The same resources do a lot of this work, whether it's refining, heavy process, those type of things. And so it's very transferable knowledge. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : George, so maybe I can follow-up on Jamie's question in the sense that, as we move forward here, is it right to assume that in the current environment it would be more difficult to grow backlog for the company even if your non-process businesses are doing pretty well? Just wondering sort of what you think this year. I know you have a lot of prospects and stuff, but as we're sitting here trying to figure out how to model this company, it seems like it will be more challenging to grow backlog as a company, unless you tell us that the non-process stuff can sort of more than offset process. Noel G. Watson: Well, what we'd say, Andrew, is this. Right now, as George said, that the prospect list is really good. And so sitting at this point, we expect the backlog to grow. I know with all the headwinds, things could change, but as we look out over the next 3 quarters, we frankly expect the backlog to grow, not shrink. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, Noel, that's helpful. And then maybe if I can shift gears and ask you guys about margin. How do we think about Jacobs' margins going forward? Again, it's hard because we're trying to figure out whether this is sort of your -- a real downturn or not in your process businesses. And if you look at 2008 to 2010, Jacobs' margins dropped about 80 bps during that time. How do you guys compare the current uncertainty today versus what we saw then? And I know you talked about taking cost out. You've done restructuring. So how do we look at margin trajectory this year, next year, whatever you guys can give us. Noel G. Watson: Well, you know we can't give you a lot, Andrew. Some of the markets that we're in, the oil and gas market certainly, the Canadian market and some of those, the customers are going to be relentless in driving our cost down and their cost down. But if I look at it on balance, I frankly, personally, don't expect to see much of a significant margin reduction this year. That's the way we've kind of looked at the data. Because while George talks about the process business, the margins may come down in refining and oil and gas, but they'll come down some, but the margins in the chemical business should stay strong, and the margins in the public sector business is going to be good. So I am not looking at a drop in the margins on average. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, now that's great. And then just a follow-up question for Kevin. Kevin, you mentioned a $0.03 impact on the quarter for FX and then some management transition cost. How do we look at the rest of the year for FX? What kind of impact is embedded in sort of the new guide of toward the lower end of your previous range? Kevin C. Berryman: Well, if I knew what the FX rates were going to be, I probably wouldn't be working here. I'd be on a beach somewhere with an umbrella in my drink. But notwithstanding that, look, the dynamic and the strength of the dollar certainly is having some implications for us in terms of what our reported earnings are going to be. We have some of that already embedded and expected in the outlook that we have provided, but certainly, the dollar has strengthened significantly over the course of the first quarter. So I think what we're talking about is in the neighborhood of $0.05, $0.06, maybe $0.07, $0.08 for the full year. So it's not a huge number, but it is a number that we're going to have to pay attention to and make sure that we drive our operating agenda to ensure that, that effect is minimized. Operator : The next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Kevin, maybe -- can you just help us reconcile the backlog growth in the quarter with the reduction in guidance? I know you've got some FX. I was thinking it was maybe margins, but I know Noel just said margins are going to be flat. So is it timing of the expected burn? Is there some other charges in there? Can you just help us reconcile that? Kevin C. Berryman: It's pretty simple, Steve, and nice to meet you over the phone. It is really about the burn rate in terms of our ability in the new business that has been booked and our ability to burn it when that starts and how ultimately some of the cancellations impact us in the short term. So clearly, this is something that Jacobs is used to and managing. But ultimately, it's really not about anything other than how the burn is going to go flow through the year. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Was it the very long-term projects that have a long burn or that you put some projects into backlog that may not get started right away? Noel G. Watson: Let me -- I don't think we got anything in backlog that isn't getting started that I know of. Am I right, George? George A. Kunberger: That's correct. Noel G. Watson: We don't put. If they're not starting, we're very careful about not putting them there, Steve, but some of these will be a 36-month jobs. And so the burn rate will start in preliminary engineering and engineering and then into the field. And some of these backlog initiatives aren't going to see the field until, what, the middle of '16? George A. Kunberger: That's correct. And also on the public space, while not all of it, some of the public spaces are long-term 5-year contracts, especially with the federal government. So they have a long burn rate on them. That's more true in the federal space than it is true in the state and local space, where those have the tendency to be more book and burn. So it's a little bit of a balance, but there's some of that long-term stuff in there. Noel G. Watson: And Steve, the other point I'd like to emphasize is that some of the short term is really oriented around some of the cancellation, not necessarily the burn going forward. So you get $400 million of cancellations, you got the project teams in place, and when those cancellations come through, you have to be proactive in making sure your costs get realigned. Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great, that's helpful. And then you guys have always highlighted in your slides the cost savings that you deliver for customers. I guess I'm wondering at this point, what are customers asking you for at the moment? I mean, are they asking you to find step function increases in cost savings? And how hard is it to find those savings at the moment to kind of bring costs in line with a much lower oil outlook? George A. Kunberger: Yes, this is George. Well, so what they say is they want institutional changes that help them improve their overall capital efficiency, but what they ask for is lower pricing. So a little bit of both as the lower pricing is easier -- well, it's not easy to respond to, it's easy for them to ask for it. The institutional changes and how they execute their work and their capital efficiency is really where the answer is. And so they really are, in fairness, looking at both of those things, to be honest with you. The short-term impact, of course, is putting pressure on us to lower our prices, but they're also trying to figure out how to be way more efficient in their overall capital utilization for sure. So a bit of both. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Welcome aboard, Kevin. First question for you, Kevin. Can you talk about maybe for the rest of 2015 fiscal year cash flow expectations? Are there any big working capital drains or additions that you may see? And should we continue to see continued strong cash performance, net, of course, of not anticipating any share repurchases, but prior to those types of spending? Kevin C. Berryman: Sure. A couple of comments. First, the operating cash flow characteristics of the company remains strong. And I think that one of the areas that we are, will be and have been focusing on is on the accounts receivable side. You'll get the Q, I think, over the course of the next few days, but you'll see in there that our accounts receivable were basically in line with previous levels. And it's certainly an area that is a big investment in our company, and we need to make sure we continue to be diligent and drive that number down. That's a focus in the company. So hopefully, we'll be able to see some improvements from that perspective over the course of the year. As it relates to other uses of cash, really, CapEx is not a big number for the company. Acquisitions, we're going to be, I would say, thoughtful in that process, as Noel suggested. So -- but we still have the flexibility to execute against that. And the balance of the operations are well on hand. We expect to see good cash flow. And of course, we will be -- at current share price levels -- more aggressive on the share buyback. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Thoughtful is a very good word, I think. Noel G. Watson: He said it better than I did. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : You've taught him well in 3 weeks, Noel. For Noel or George, looking at the company, going into the last peak of '07, '08, you had Motiva, you had some big projects there. You, in your recent trip to New York and Boston, you talked about how you focus on the small cap projects, going where people aren't. Is that going to be beneficial as you ride through this cycle that we're seeing in energy? Not just in your energy work, but overall that will allow you to generate the better performance maybe in this cycle than maybe you did in the last cycle? Noel G. Watson: As you know, Mike, and as you've known us well over the years, we're going to continue to focus on mid-cap sustaining work, those type of things, and we got the system working really hard at that. And there's going to be a lot more of that work around than there is the elephants. I think we know that. There's going to be some elephants offshore, but there aren't going to be many onshore. And so that kind of plays to our strength. It means it's going to be a dog fight because competitors are going to come down and want our piece of the pie. So they're going to come after us like gangbusters, but we are well positioned. And so I would say that, right now, I think you used the word downturn, we're not classifying this as a downturn. We got headwinds. We got some markets that are really strong, Mike, and we think they're going to carry us through quite nicely. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : I guess that would be one differentiating from where you're -- in 2015 versus exiting 2008 or '09 given the acquisitions you've made and your geographic positioning, correct? Noel G. Watson: Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Revenue burn really accelerated in national programs in the quarter. I'm wondering if you could just talk about the major programs that drove the year-over-year pickup and what the cadence for revenue burn looks like from here. George A. Kunberger: National burn, you're talking about public and institutional in general? Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So national, specifically, national government. George A. Kunberger: Yes, the national government. Well, I'm having a hard time understanding where you get that data exactly. The national government business for us has been stable. That's for darn sure. And our building sector ties into the national buildings business, definitely been uptick-ing. And I'm getting help here from Andy Kremer who's been responsible for that. Andy, why don't you just go ahead and answer. Andrew F. Kremer: Yes, I mean, a part of what we're seeing is reflected in the FNS acquisition, George, which has had a significant contribution this quarter. George A. Kunberger: Right. Thanks, Andy. Noel G. Watson: We needed to get help, sorry about that. George A. Kunberger: That's okay. That's why we have a team. Yes, did you understand Andy's answer about FNS? Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So the year-over-year growth in national government program revenue was driven by acquisitions? George A. Kunberger: Well yes, the FNS -- go ahead, Andy. Andrew F. Kremer: We had -- FNS was a significant contributor. That was a fair-sized acquisition, and it caught [ph] into afterburners this quarter. It's been a terrific result for us. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then for downstream, given, I guess, the change in cadence due to cancellations, can you just talk about how you expect the revenue burn to shape up over the course of the year? Based on the prior comments, it sounds like second quarter looks like the first quarter, but maybe you can provide some more color and then talk about, is there visibility on a pickup in the back half in downstream revenue burn specifically? Noel G. Watson: Hey, Gary, you want to talk about it? Joseph G. Mandel: We announced a major award in the downstream space. As Noel said, we will go from early engineering, and it'll be towards the middle of next year before we start going to the field and doing a lot of procurement. But when we see these cycles like this and you see our clients starting to cut some jobs and reduce cost, historically, that's been favorable for us. We've picked up market share with this brownfield work and the sustaining capital, and we've been seeing that. We've been really focusing on that, and so you should see a steady book and burn with the exception of some of those major projects that are 3, 3.5 years long. Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then maybe lastly on chemicals, maybe you could just touch on the cadence of that. Sounds like you have visibility on revenue burn accelerating over the course of the year, but maybe, Gary, you might be willing to flesh that out for us a bit more? Joseph G. Mandel: Well, again, we're in the sustaining capital and brownfield, both on refining and chemicals, a large part of our business. The small cap project, it's our sweet spot. And so with the exception of the big CapEx projects, it's pretty consistent as well. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Connors with Stifel. Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I just wanted to get a sense of when we'd start to see the benefits of the cost reductions take hold and whether you expect that to pass to the bottom line or will most of it be passed on lower prices on projects. Noel G. Watson: Well, we like to say it's all going to go to the bottom line, but that's probably not right. I think what we're going to see is a combination. Certainly, in some of the areas, particularly the big oil guys, they're going to pressure us for price reductions, and we may have to give a little bit. What we do believe is some of these cost reductions will go right to the bottom line. Now whether it's 50-50 or 70-30, I'm just not that smart. Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then, it's not only commodities falling, but I suspect a lot of craft labor rates will also come down quite a bit too here in North America. And this is positive in the long run for future downstream projects. But are you being asked right now to redo any of your downstream FEED work to account for what is going to be some coming slack on the oil patch? Noel G. Watson: Gary, I'm going to give that one back to you. Joseph G. Mandel: As Noel mentioned earlier, some of our skill sets are transferable, and so we are starting to shift some of those resources from the oil patch to our sustaining capital business in downstream. The projects that are underway in the field, they're not canceling those. They may slow down the rate of spend with those construction resources, but they're not getting canceled as much as the projects that are in the study phase or the FEED phase. But long term, it should create some lower pricing, but it's still a tight marketplace. There's a lot of craft shortages out there, and it is escalating. So it's going to be tight for a while. Noel G. Watson: So it would be your position, Gary, that the craft labor rates are not going down? Joseph G. Mandel: They're not going down in the short term. Operator : And next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : So I guess, the first question I had was, when you look at revising and putting out a cautious outlook, from my experience, clearly you've seen some cancellations, but in essence, it seems even if you are more on the front-end side tends to be the later cycle. So how did you go about the process based on the feedback you started getting from some of your customers and you sort of extrapolated on that or have you actually tried to go through your prospects and really see what is likely to get pushed out or canceled? Noel G. Watson: Well, I've got to be really honest with you, Tahira. I'd say we did a lot of detailed work and then we threw a dart, to be very honest with you. I mean, it's that kind of task as we tried to nail down the forecast and figure. And we finally decided we can't because there's too many moving pieces right now. And remember, we're only a couple of months into this decline. And so where it's going to land, where it's going to stop, how long it's going to be. I've got the Vice Chairman of Chevron sitting here with me, and he kept telling me to generalize. And I think the real question is, how long? And by the way, he's not smart enough to answer that, so I'm certainly not. So I think that's how we got at it. I mean, this was not a precise exercise. We tried to make it, and we couldn't do it. Kevin C. Berryman: Tahira, I would augment that to -- basically, the collective -- with some of the team, we've had a lot of discussions over the last 3 weeks, and I think Noel is entirely accurate in his representation of, there's been a lot of key variables that we need to keep track of as it relates to what the momentum is in our business in certain end markets, and look, we feel comfortable with what we're telling you. Certainly, could it vary from what we're talking about given the dynamics in some of the end markets, of course. But we're going to be diligent most importantly in terms of our management of our fixed cost structure, which will allow us to be successful in any of the environments going forward. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Got it, okay. And so Kevin, the second question is for you. Number one in regards to that, is the low end of the guidance then what you think is -- does that incorporate the worst-case scenario on the macro side that you came up with? And then number two, you're clearly coming from an industry, different industry with hopefully some new insights as well you can bring on the cost-cutting side. So I would love to get some sense of what you think could be brought in that's kind of new on the cost side as well. Kevin C. Berryman: Sure, the question. Three weeks in, I would tell you that it has been very exciting to jump in with both arms and legs to learn the business in. I certainly feel as if I'm getting a good grasp of some of the core tenets of the business and some of the challenges and some of the opportunities. I do believe that, collectively, the team is having a good pulse on what's happening in the market and things that we might want to be considering in terms of driving improved levels of performance. I would tell you, it's too early for me to give you any serious and discrete things that we will be talking about in the future, but I do believe there are opportunities. And it's certainly why I came in my opening comments, and I think the team believes the same. As it relates to the guidance, look, it is what it is. We are comfortable with that at this particular point in time, and we will update it as we give more information over the course of the balance of the year. Noel G. Watson: Tahira, that's John's way of saying, we're not going to give guidance within guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Chad Dillard on for Vishal. Noel G. Watson: Could you speak up a little bit? We're having a hard time. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So how much revenue in 2015 has already been booked into your backlog? And then also, could you give us a color on your mix between service or maintenance projects versus book-and-burn projects? Kevin C. Berryman: So just a quick comment, I would say, roughly, the number is 65-ish percent, and so we feel pretty good about the momentum behind some of the backlog that has been communicated in some of my comments and George's as well. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And then can you give color on the breakdown of your prospect list between process and then non-process opportunities? Noel G. Watson: Yes, George, take that will you. George A. Kunberger: Yes. I know, absolutely. So in the process world and balancing the process in, say, public and institutional, it's, I'd say, slightly favored, but only slightly favored in the public sector. And then when you would lump in the -- with the process world, the other sort of related process industries, like pharma, et cetera, it's probably a 50-50 balance right now. Operator : The next question comes from an Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Anna Kaminskaya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : My first question was just around your cash balance, how much is it in the U.S. and how much is internationally? Just thinking about just how much cash capacity you have to -- for buyback in the second quarter or do you have to finance it with the free cash flow or maybe add a little bit of debt on your balance sheet. And how much would you be comfortable in carrying in terms of leverage? Kevin C. Berryman: Hi, Anna, nice to talk to you over the phone. Look, much of our cash is outside of the U.S., but we ultimately have the ability to bring cash in to certainly fund what we expect to be doing as it relates to our share buyback. So we're not feeling incremental pressure as it relates to that. In terms of the leverage factor going forward and where are we comfortable. Certainty right now, at a net debt level that's approaching 0, we're certainly not overlevered by any stretch of the imagination, and we're comfortable that we have the firepower to execute against any acquisitions that may occur, even though we will be thoughtful relative to that and any share buyback work that we're executing against. Anna Kaminskaya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And then if I think about the mix impact on your margins maybe longer term, let's say, public outgrows process, would that be margin dilutive? I know you probably don't disclose margins by segment, but how should I be thinking about the mix impact on your margins longer term? Noel G. Watson: Well, we're not smart enough. This is Noel again. We're not smart enough to know the difference. We don't think the mix impact is going to be measurable. Anna Kaminskaya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So you think your margins are somewhat comparable between process and public? Noel G. Watson: Well, when the mix comes down, and it's all over the world, yes. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just looking at the trajectory of field services revenue over the last few years, we saw it starting to ramp up. And in this quarter, it's down. Looks like it's down organically year-over-year. I guess just from the cycle point of view, you guys made it clear that you don't think the cycle is over, but where are we in the cycle? Are we reentering a period where we're going to stay in long periods of FEED and not make investment decisions that can lead to the field services construction work? Some of your thoughts around that, I think, would be appreciated. Noel G. Watson: Hey, Gary, do you want to try that? Joseph G. Mandel: I think probably one of the biggest reasons for the decline year-on-year is we had a very large field service presence and business in the oil sands that's been reduced somewhat with the CapEx reduction. It's somewhat offset with our growing focus of maintenance services, both targeted at turnarounds and brownfield work. But in terms of taking it from FEED to construction, it's pretty much the same ratio we've been experiencing for the last year, 1.5 years. These are large projects, and they take a while to get through the engineering phase and the procurement phase to mobilize the construction. It's probably going to be the same. Although you'll see incremental growth in our maintenance business, we are taking market share. We've announced some, and there's others that we can't announce, but we are growing the number of sites that we're providing maintenance on. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : But it sounds like if oil and gas or the upstream in the sands is an area that was a big contributor is falling off, does that mean that the overall shift between field service and TPS now then favors TPS? And then does that have a possible -- positive implication on the margins do you think going forward? Joseph G. Mandel: I would say that while the oil sand spend, the CapEx is down, there's still a lot of sustaining capital work there. So we have a significant presence. Plus, our focus is to taking more and more sites within the chemicals and refining. This is happening. So it will be the same more or less mix that we've had. It's not going to be a huge shift. We're redeploying those resources. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got you. Okay. One of the questions that was touched upon earlier was some of the federal contracts being longer in duration. I think a few quarters ago the Sellafield one was one of the more notable contracts you guys had booked. At the time, I think the funding level of that contract was not fully funded or it was substantially unfunded. Has the funding for that work been coming through? And are you doing work on that one today? Curious on your thoughts on that one. Noel G. Watson: Phil, go ahead. Philip J. Stassi: Yes, this is Phil Stassi. Yes, the funding for that project is here, and there are some additional ones. Sellafield is very active. Those projects are not only planned, but most of them are funded. And as you probably know, we've invested pretty heavily in Sellafield opening a new office and did an acquisition of a maintenance and construction contract there. So we're getting ready for the load there and the work is funded for the most part and is lining up. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got you. And the second quarter comment that the year-over-year growth might not be very significant. Was that based on the adjusted EPS of $0.82 or was that based on the GAAP EPS of $0.63? I just want to make sure that we're clear on that one. Kevin C. Berryman: Thankfully, it's the adjusted number. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Had to make sure. And then just a final question here for me. We're over a year now with SKM. That was a big acquisition. Thoughts on where you stand today and have you been able to deliver revenue synergies or has the outlook for revenue synergies offset acquisition starting to materialize today? Noel G. Watson: Yes, let me answer that. Yes, we view SKM as a big success. Obviously, they had a big mining business, and it's being impacted by the $2.50 copper and all of that, but the infrastructure side of the business is singing [ph]. And we have been able to do a fair amount of synergies. We have a pretty good airport business in North America and the U.K. And what we've been able to do, we've been winning airport work right and left in Australia recently. So we view that as a big success. And there's still things to do in terms of the integration. And that's not totally complete, but it will complete this year. Operator : The next question comes from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : I guess, first, George, you talked about the various end markets, but geographically are you seeing a big divergence in your customers' response to the market? George A. Kunberger: In any major particular market sector, are you asking or particularly process? John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : I guess more on the -- probably on the process side and especially Europe, Middle East, but also the industrial side? George A. Kunberger: Yes, I think that's a very good question. And that is accurate. I mean, if you go around the horn, I mean what's happening in Canada is very different than what's happening in the Middle East relative to this marketplace, dramatically different, right? And so and then if you go to Southeast United States, which is predominantly a lot of chemical business and Northern Europe, which is chemical, as well as some upgrading of efficiencies within refinery. So yes, it is different geographically in how the clients are responding to it, for sure, for different reasons. I mean, what Saudi Aramco does versus other major oil companies, have different motivations behind their capital expenditures and why they're doing these projects. So yes, it is quite different for sure. And fortunately, we're positioned well in most of those plays. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : And how would you characterize those differences? George A. Kunberger: Well, okay, so I mean, I think the oil sands business, I think we all understand. I mean, oil prices are down. And if you look at the Middle East, the Middle East can pump oil out of the ground much more cost effectively than other places in the world. They have a lot of social infrastructure ambitions that they need to fund and want to fund on behalf of all the citizens in that part of the world, so they'll progress with projects in order to drive those -- that development regardless. And I won't get into other geopolitical considerations, it's beyond my scope of knowledge. But I think you'll understand what I'm talking about there as well, but yes, very different. Noel G. Watson: Yes, I think even if you go into Morocco, where we're just finishing about $6.5 billion worth of work, and we got another big phase starting, that work is moving forward nicely. And so the demographic issues or geopolitical, however you want to name them, are very different across the world. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Okay. And Noel, can you give us any update or comment on the CEO search? Noel G. Watson: Well, I'm wondering when you were going to ask that. I'm having too much fun, and we canceled it. No, that's not right. The reality is, we've started. We're having weekly phone calls. We're getting into the meat of really getting on with it. And so I would say, by the next phone call, which is 3 months from now, we ought to be pretty well complete. I hope so anyway. George A. Kunberger: But he is having a lot of fun. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : I wanted to ask one more question about guidance just to make sure I'm clear. Because you talked about Q2, not a lot of year-over-year growth, which implies kind of an acceleration in the back half. And I'm curious what's driving that, is it the backlog growth you had in Q1? Noel G. Watson: Can you get that? Kevin C. Berryman: Certainly, that's part of it. The very strong level of sales, bookings that we had in Q1, kind of the strongest sales level that we had in, I don't know, probably 6, 7 years would be my guess in that quarter. So very, very strong. And so that will ultimately allow us to finish stronger in the year than the beginning of the year. So that's certainly a part of it. And then the other part is what we've already talked about in cancellation of some of the projects and the realignment of resources back against where we're seeing momentum. And that just puts some pressure on the short term. The other dynamic is, we are going to be reducing our cost structure, our fixed cost structure to recognize some of the headwinds, and that will kick in later in the year as opposed to earlier in the year. All of those things add up to the commentary and the kind of directional guidance we've given, and that's basically it. Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then the only other question I had was just on, what are you hearing from your -- on the infrastructure side, what are you hearing from your people in D.C.? I mean, is it time to get excited about a highway bill or some kind of solution on that front? Noel G. Watson: Do you want to try that, Andy? Andrew F. Kremer: So the -- yes, the answer is yes. We're seeing recovery on the transportation front in a number of areas. One, the improvement in state budgets, as well as a little bit more certainty in the budgeting process in Washington with the midterm elections behind it. George A. Kunberger: Yes, but also just with cheap gas and people driving more. I mean, the dollars per gallon that goes into the federal coffer stays the same, and so there's more money going in. So whether they get a transportation bill passed or not, there's certainly more money going into their coffers which is getting spun back out into these projects around the countryside. Noel G. Watson: Yes, I think you got to remember, if you go look at the budgets within the individual states, they're up fairly dramatically over the last 3 or 4 years. So even here in California, our governor found a way to have a lot of money to spend. That's -- we taxpayers don't like that, but that's a fact. As a business, we do. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Norfleet with Alembic Global. Nicholas Chen : This is actually Nick Chen for Rob this morning. Great. So I know we touched on it a few questions ago, but I just wanted to go back to the SKM integration. I was hoping you could give some more details around the restructuring. Number one, how much of the cost savings were realized in Q1? And then also what sort of annualized run rate for these savings should we expect? Kevin C. Berryman: I don't think that ultimately the cost savings were disclosed in the discussion relative to the restructuring, but we have realized our run rate at this particular point in time in Q1. And we expect that run rate to continue through the balance of the year. If you look at our SG&A cost in the quarter, it was really driven by a full quarter SKM in the numbers, and effectively, our restructuring benefits were able to offset all of the other inflationary costs and other dynamics that we have to manage in a $13 billion company. Nicholas Chen : Great. That's really helpful. And also, in terms of the downstream markets, I know that we talked a little bit about it before. I was wondering if you could give some more details in terms of refiners spending in order to comply with the new T3 standards. Noel G. Watson: George? George A. Kunberger: Yes, well, so we've been talking about Tier 3 spending for quite some time, and it hasn't, as you well know, manifested itself fully as we anticipated. That was primarily because of delays in the compliance space that a lot of these refiners were able to take advantage of, as well as being able to trade credits off. So it has been pushed out. We've worked on a lot of those projects in the study phase and some actual projects, but it will just be more stretched out over the next 2 to 3 years. And so the aggregate of the concentrated spend that we once anticipated. But I'd say, it's been offset by the ISA 84 spending for sure, and -- which I think in the long run is actually going to be a greater amount of spend, and we're even better positioned to do that work quite frankly. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Dircks with William Blair. Paul Dircks : Just briefly here to follow-up on the SG&A expense in the quarter. I know you guys had mentioned that there were some management transition costs. Were there any other drivers of that dollar amount which is actually above what we had anticipated ourselves? And also how should we expect the trajectory in an absolute-dollar basis of SG&A expenses to go over the balance of fiscal year '15? Kevin C. Berryman: Well, I'll reemphasize what we just talked about. Really, the driver to SGA was the full quarter impact of SKM for the first quarter of 2015. As you recall, SKM came into the portfolio of Jacobs right near the end of the first quarter last year. So that really is the driver to the figures. We don't give specific guidance as it relates to the SG&A numbers going forward. But clearly, we're going to be taking steps to ensure that we're disciplined in the management of those costs, again, because we want to make sure that we're going to be able to be successful in any environment which we're going to need to be competing. Noel G. Watson: Hey, guys, we're going to have to terminate. We've got a board meeting we've got to go do. We've got people standing in the hall. I'm sorry we can't answer all the questions, but Kevin is here, and he'll take all your questions. So just give him a buzz, okay. We thank you for all your interest. We're excited about what's going on. We feel good about what's going on, obviously. We're a little disconcerted about some of the unknowns, but we're going to power through all this. So thanks again and have a good day. Bye now. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements that are discussed on this webcast. The safe harbor statement is found on Slide 2 of our webcast presentation. With that, we\u2019re on Slide 5. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin Berryman. Kevin Berryman : Good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be with you for my second earnings call with Jacob\u2019s. We have a lot to cover this morning so I will dispense with any introductory commentary as it relates to the quarter and jump right in as it relates to our review of results for second quarter of 2015. And as Michelle noted we\u2019re on Slide 5. And to start, I would like to take a few quick moments to discuss our GAAP-related results. As noted on the slide, we certainly were able to deliver increases in our operating profit and earnings per share figures for the quarter 2015, second quarter 2015 versus the prior-year period. In addition, our balance sheet remains strong at the end of the quarter as evidenced by the fact that we were able to have $465 million in cash at the end of the quarter and $290 million in net debt by the end of the quarter. These figures were able to be delivered even though we had a significant wrap up in our share buyback program and we had a record buyback of roughly 140 million in the quarter to ultimately realize a 7.3 million program to date reduction in our shares as it relates to the program through the second quarter of 2015. I will not plan to spend a lot of time discussing variances versus year ago on a GAAP-related basis given that a lot of the variation year-over-year is driven by large discrete items between the two years. I will have or plan to spend a little bit more time talking about the results in our adjusted figures and I believe that will give you greater clarity on the underlying trends and dynamics regarding our business for the second quarter. But before turning to Slide 6 to do that, I thought some commentary on our revenue changes versus year-over-year is important given that our revenue is actually decreased 8.6% versus the year-ago period. Certainly, foreign exchange, as noted on the slide, represented the single largest drag on our sales on the quarter accounting for 5% points of the full year-over-year change. In addition, we also had pass-through revenues that were also down year-over-year and they represented an additional 3% points of the drop in revenues. As you already know, pass-through revenues tend to have lower margin levels than the rest of our business and as a result of this, this fall in sales [ph] did not have a material impact on our profitability in the quarter. So as a result, our net underlying organic growth ex [ph] foreign exchange and the pass-through revenues was effectively flat versus the year-ago period. This quiet [ph] growth was supported by the diversity of our portfolio with stronger certain end-markets offsetting weaker ones, our gross was still less than we would have expected for the quarter. In short, inspected improvements on our revenues associated with our strong backlog transitioning to an effective higher-level of burn did not yet materialize and gained a longer-term momentum that we do ultimately expect. As a result, we have taken additional actions to mitigate the impact of this shortfall, by instituting a formal restructuring program that is meant to further align and simplify our business, resulting in reduced cost and increases in our simplicity and alignment in the organization. This program reduced our GAAP-reported results by 0.08 in the quarter, resulting in our adjusted EPS figure of 0.72 for the quarter. A quick few comments on the restructuring initiative. This program is expected to continue into Q3 and Q4 and we would expect to provide you a more robust update on this initiative at our Q3 earnings call. I would also like to clarify a revised guidance for the year. Our guidance as noted in the press release has been provided on an adjusted basis, which excludes any impact of our restructuring efforts and the cost associated with those efforts. Of course, any benefits associated with our restructuring initiative will be included in the results. Although the vast majority of the expected savings our restructuring initiative ultimately will be realized in the full-year 2016 versus 2015. So turning to Slide 6 and using the adjusted Q2 2015 figure of 0.72 to discuss results versus year-ago, you will recall that we had several discrete items that impacted the year-ago quarter, including SKM profitability, weather and holiday-related costs, European project issues, all of which were partially offset by a gain associated with the sale of certain intellectual property. When adding the net impact of all of these items back to the profit of year ago, adjusted earnings per share was identified as being 0.19 higher than the actual GAAP figure reported of 0.63 a year ago. So I would like to compare the two figures of adjusted EPS of year ago, the 0.82 versus the 0.72 and that translates ultimately into a 15% reduction in the operating profit levels for the year Q2 2015, for the period 2015 second quarter of 2014. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about that variance. First, you will note on the slide that we have not adjusted this quarter for any impact or current quarter results for weather and/or holidays. Even though, in our analysis, we have estimated the impact of these issues to be similar in 2015 Q2 to the results of Q2 2014. The fact that the impact year-over-year is somewhat similar is not surprising given the challenging weather that you all recall that we\u2019ve had especially for you on the East Coast. This represents a 7 percentage point differential on OP growth year-over-year simply because we have not adjusted for the impact of these issues this year while we did last year. Our plan going forward would be not to adjust for these types of items in the future. In addition, included in the second quarter 2015 are higher-than-normal employee benefit related cost and cost associated with our executive transitions. While these are real costs that we incurred in Q2, the majority of the increase are unique to Q2 and expected to be lower going forward. These people-related cost account for another 7 percentage point of the variance year-over-year. Finally, our operating profit in Q2 2015 was also impacted by the strong dollar, which contributed another 2 percentage point as a fall on OP versus the prior year period. So given the nature of these items, the impact, the comparability of the adjusted figures versus year ago, we believe that our Q2 results are indicative of a stronger level of profitability demonstrated comparative with suggest [ph]. It supports the view that our underlying profit levels are relatively year-over-year after recognizing that many of these specific items are expected not to be continued over the balance of the year 2015. So before turning the call back to Noel, a final word on our backlog, which is exhibited on Slide 7. As noted, backlog grew 2.4% year-over-year and remains near record levels. This backlog represents a book-to-bill over the trailing 12-month period of 1.05 as shown on the slide. Importantly, our success in selling [ph] work is resulting in our backlog remaining at this near record level and gives us continued confidence that our longer-term growth prospects are robust. Our diversity in our portfolio enables us to manage through certain end-market headwinds. The strength in our backlog this quarter is certainly indicative of this as our continued record level, near record levels was delivered even though we continued to see cancellations in our backlog specifically in the Canadian region. On a positive note, we would expect the cancellations related to the price disruptions in the oil market are now largely behind at this particular point in time. So while shorter-term pressure remains, given the certain disruptions in certain of our end markets, longer-term, we continue to remain optimistic given our strong backlog positions and continued robust level of prospects. So that concludes my remarks on the quarter and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Noel. Noel Watson : Hey, thank you, Kevin. Let\u2019s go on to Slide #9, the Growth Strategy. We talked about this a lot and I\u2019ll just summarize it again. The relationship-based model is still the model for the company. It works very well for us. And a lot of these record sales that you see going on right now were near record backlog are partly because this model is working very well when put together with our sales model. So it is the strategy that keeps us close our clients, trying to deliver superior value to these clients and make it work. And so that model remains intact and we believe it\u2019s working well. One thing we are doing and we do have a lot of diversity in the markets as you\u2019ll see in a few minutes when we go through that, the sphere on the next page. But we do have a lot of in-market diversity which gives us a lot of strength when some of our markets aren\u2019t as robust as they once were or certainly as we thought they were going to be even 90 days ago. And I\u2019m talking about the oil and gas on that and we\u2019ll have Gary Mandel discuss that in a little more detail. We still have good cash. We have not been in an acquisition mode here in the last few months as we try to deal with the headwinds in the market and certain other things, but certainly long-term, as we go back to double-digit growth, we will be back in the acquisition market. But what Kevin said was when we discovered what was happening in the oil price and the other commodity prices, we had realigned our cost with the environment. To put it kind of simply, we\u2019ve taken this opportunity to make some changes. If you go on to Page 10, what we have here is our end-market diversity. We\u2019ll talk in a little more detail. The backlog is good. You\u2019ll notice we got it split in three different parts there, downstream, upstream, chemicals, industrial and public institution. It is a nice split. It hasn\u2019t changed a lot over the past couple of three years, but it does give us the diversity we need. And I think we\u2019ve said many time to you folks in the phone, we\u2019ll never have all these markets singing together. If we get five or six of them singing, we\u2019re going to be doing just fine. Now, first up, I want to talk about the heavy process business which includes chemical, industrial, public and institution, we got Gary Mandel sitting in a construction trailer in Oman. And, Gary, I\u2019m going to give it to you for a few minutes. Okay. Gary Mandel : Thank you, Noel, and good morning. And as Noel said I\u2019m calling in from Oman. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. I\u2019m visiting one of our oil and gas upstream projects. It\u2019s a multibillion gas project here in Oman. We\u2019re in the middle of the construction phase. It\u2019s one of several we have in the Middle East. The Middle East continues to offer robust opportunities for us in the upstream sector. And as you know, we\u2019ve been reporting that we\u2019re growing our Middle East operations year over year. So we\u2019re well-positioned for that. Overall, our process business is mixed primarily due to oil prices causing our owners and clients to reevaluate their cash flow, their ongoing projects. It\u2019s causing a little bit of recycle and some delayed decisions. And in some cases some delayed investments. However, as we mentioned, our strong client relationships help us take advantage of these cyclical swings in the energy prices. And we have a unique ability to power through these cycles with our focus on brownfield sustaining capital and maintenance. While the dropping price of oil is causing a slowdown in some CapEx projects in one part of our business, the cheap feed stock translates into opportunities in other parts of our business such as chemicals which is really robust and I\u2019ll come back to it. We continue to see a lot of good prospects in this market as evidenced by our continued sales progress. And our portfolio is balanced and positioned for growth. When we look at refining, on the CapEx side, we\u2019re seeing some mixed signals here as our clients are evaluating their cash flow. However, on the OpEx side, on servicing the installed base, the maintenance, the turnarounds, that is still stable. The maintenance in brownfield provides sustaining work. We see that increasing both in the number of sites that we have been awarded as well as the number of proposals that we are pursuing. When the cash flow is affecting our owners, one of the benefits we obtain from that is they start to reduce their supply chain. They start to leverage suppliers who can service more than one facility. We picked up several sites this year and hope to pick up more because we\u2019re better leveraged with our big footprint and our capabilities to service multiple sites for a single client. The number of sites in the US and Canada is increasing. We\u2019ve seen an increase of over 15% of the sites we\u2019ve been awarded year-to-date, as well as the operation and maintenance spend is still estimated at about 30 billion in the Gulf Coast region alone. And I\u2019ll come back to a similar span in Canada where we\u2019re well-positioned. In short, we continue to see investment in North America, Europe and the Middle East. Although certain projects are being delayed, there still remains investment in plant conversions and expansions to optimize feedstocks and to enhance plant performance and profitability. In the Middle East we\u2019re seeing opportunities for reconfigurations and compliance programs. Our ability to leverage these opportunities with our global footprint and our heavy process capability is a key discriminator for us. Through our core client relationships, our alliances, our framework agreements, we continue to participate in much of the refined product activity across the globe. Lastly on refining, we are focusing and helping our clients focus on upgrades, operating efficiency, safety regulations and energy savings. With reduced cash flow, they\u2019re trying to get more out of their assets. While we\u2019re seeing pricing pressure, we\u2019re still winning both EPC and EPCM contracts, especially for the refinery upgrades and improvements. Our cost past [ph] year, our strong safety performance, our ability to leverage our global resource base is helping us to continue to win work. We have participated in our Value Plus savings program. We\u2019ve able to document and save our clients with our innovative solutions, project delivery models, global sourcing, $5.8 billion to date. This helps us continue to get in front of our clients and offer lower-cost deliveries in this time of low prices. In North America, we have several billion dollars of TIC under contract today along these upgrades and operating efficiencies. So the work is continuing. When we move on to oil gas, again, the CapEx is mixed mainly due to the cash flow from the lower oil price. However, OpEx is stable. Oil prices are starting to stabilize a little bit. However, we\u2019re focusing more of our energy and resources in sales efforts on the brownfield and enhanced-recovery projects. As I mentioned in the Gulf Coast, we\u2019re seeing 35 billion of spend on operating and maintenance in Canada. As you know, we are the dominant player in Canada in maintenance and turnarounds. And that activity continues. Long-term growth of oil production is possible, albeit at different cost levels. Our unique position is helping in working with our clients through innovative project execution models, modernization, global sourcing to enable them to continue to focus on their operations and enhance their production. One of the things that I\u2019d like to share with you is we have many global EPCM agreements in place for this installed base. It allows us to leverage the sustaining capital opportunities that are out there. We\u2019re still winning work. We expect the industry to continue to spend albeit concentrating more on the lower margin operating expenditure side of the equation than the capital expenditure. Even when prices go below the marginal cost of operating oil fields, many producers opt to keep them going and store oil as long as they can when they expect prices to increase. Because it\u2019s more costly to shut these facilities down and restart them later. Jacobs, with these agreements in place, with most of the major oil companies including the national oil companies, continue provide EPC and maintenance opportunities to this installed base. We\u2019re heavily involved with these plans. We\u2019re constantly reevaluating and estimating the cost of these additional revamps and debottlenecking. And so again, we\u2019re well positioned for that When we look at chemicals, you see that chemicals is 23% of our process segment. It is the strongest segment in our process business. It\u2019s primarily driven by the cheap feedstocks today. We\u2019ve had several awards in the quarter and we hope to announce several more that our in the pipeline. Broadly, chemical investments remain strong globally. Pure chemical companies seem to be benefiting more and outpacing the integrated companies. We continue to be enthusiastic with the chemicals in-markets and our pipeline continues to be robust. The oil prices and cheap feedstocks are driving more investment with these clients. Some global energy companies are reevaluating their next phases. These investments are in competition with other parts of their business. So we got to continue to help them find lower cost to deliver these projects. As I\u2019ve said, with innovative project delivery solutions, modularization, global sourcing and the like. Jacobs has a strong chemical resume plus a global delivery. These are our key strengths. For many of our clients, this is an area that is growing and they are looking direct more of their limited capital spend into this segment of their business. So that in turn means more opportunities for Jacobs to help our clients grow their chemical businesses. We have relationships with over 25 global chemical companies with standing master services agreements representing a significant portion of this global chemical spend. I am bullish on that. George will talk about the robustness of our pipelines and our prospects, our activity is strong. We continue to win work. We continue to position for work. We have a very good footprint on our sustaining services, our maintenance, our turnaround business. And I think this will allow us to continue to grow that backlog as we move forward. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over. Noel Watson : Okay, thanks, Gary. George Kunberger, our EVP of Sales. You\u2019re on, George. George Kunberger : Okay, thanks, Noel. Good morning everybody. I would like to take just a few moments to talk about two important sectors; one, the industrial sector and then I want to talk a little bit longer about our public and institutional business. So on the industrial which is Slide 12, let me just make a couple of points and then we\u2019ll move on to the public sector part of the business. As you well know, those who have been following us for a long time, the industrial sector is an important - not necessarily a large robust part of our business but still nonetheless a very important business. Represents about - if you look at the number rights now about 10%, a little over 10% of our backlog and about 12% or 13% of our graining 12 month\u2019s revenue. But we\u2019re going in to the couple of sectors, let me just make a couple of points. On the biopharma, those of you who have been maybe watching shows [ph] like 15 minutes, having been following some of the tremendous development in immunotherapy that have been going on in medicine around the world, that is now starting to cascade into significant capital spending plans in the part of all the big pharma businesses around the world. I mean, I\u2019ve heard quotes and I wouldn\u2019t under a lot of [indiscernible] swear to this, but certainly our clients talk about those numbers being in terms of four to five times the capital spending plans on big biotech project plans over the next 10 year than we saw in the 1990s and early 2000s. And, of course, as you well know, Jacobs has been a longstanding, strong player in the pharma business. We remain that way today. We\u2019ve expanded our presence to be more than just U.S. and Western European base. It\u2019s now being truly global. So we\u2019re well positioned and indeed while we\u2019re not in a position to announce specifics because the press releases our out, but we have been successful in winning several nice large projects on a global basis that hopefully we\u2019ll be able to talk more specifically about that in the coming weeks. So pretty bullish on pharma. It\u2019s only 4% of our backlog but it is a growing business and we could be in a very strong position. I won\u2019t say a lot about mining. It really hasn\u2019t change in the last three months. I don\u2019t anticipate that the situation in mining is going to change dramatically. Our position remains as it\u2019s been, good, strong percentage [ph] cap development. We are participating in the various studies that are ongoing. And a couple of big capital projects and there are a couple still out there that are being considered, we are positioned well to compete. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a big change in that business over the next year, for sure. But it is an important part of our business and it will be certainly in three or four years when commodity prices turnaround. Pulp and paper, high-tech consumer products, you all know, we\u2019ve been a big alliance player which feeds [ph] well under our consumer products business and our high-tech business around the world. And we have a little bit and Noel is going to get mad at me for saying this but we\u2019re not really - no one has a power player and I\u2019m not really saying we are but there is a lot of money being spent around the world and we\u2019re positioned in some niche market that really are going to be important part of our sales for the next 6 to 9 months. Those are specifically some of the new builds that are going on in the UK. We\u2019re not necessarily in the power hour island part of that but certainly in the OSDL part of that. And then in areas like the Middle East where there\u2019s lots of nation building going on. There\u2019s a lot of what you could call broader utility work in support of some of those facilities, new cities, new industrial manufacturing facilities that are actively engaged in. So power is the broadest sense of the work is not a small piece of our business and we are going to be making some sales going forward. So that\u2019s really all I wanted to say about the industrial sector. But I obviously want to spend a little bit more time about our public and institutional business. It\u2019s a big part of our business. It\u2019s a growing part of our businesses and I think it\u2019s an area that I think we\u2019re looking to stabilize our finances and our growth as a company certainly over the next six months and as the process areas Gary just talked about start to recover and we grow again in that area. First of all, in the national government side, this business today - well, first of all, it constitutes a couple of governments. It\u2019s U.S. government as you all well know. It\u2019s certainly as U.K. government and Australia and a couple of other governments, but primarily, those three. The spending forecast in the U.S. and the U.K. and also in Australia. From an MOD [ph] Department of Defense areas is actually forecasted to grow in 2015 and even further in 2016 by about 8% each year. So it\u2019s sort of bottomed out and it\u2019s starting to grow again. The pattern of spending in the federal government specifically in the U.S. has become very backend from a fiscal year perspective than it has been in recent years. And the case in point, if you note that, actually, our backlog is down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. But if you look at our federal bids of today, we are at an all-time record high as far as the number of opportunities that we have submitted specific proposals on and are awaiting decisions that will happen between now and the end of our fiscal year. That actually represents about $5 billion to $6 billion of revenue just on pending opportunities in that particular business which are our technology business. And of course, as you well know, we generally do pretty well there. So our conversion rate is high and so we anticipate that\u2019s a big part of our sales in the second half. But it\u2019s not going to end at the end of this year. There is another $4 billion to $5 billion worth of prospects that are near term, in other words, we\u2019ll be submitting proposals on those between now and the end of this fiscal year. So those will cascade into FY \u201916 as far as opportunities for us. So our federal government business is robust and growing and we anticipate it to be very strong at the second half of this year and into \u201916. On the infrastructure business, as you well know, that\u2019s a pretty broad global business for us. I mean, we have big business in U.K., we have big business in U.S., we have a growing business in the Middle East, and of course, a very large business in Australia and New Zealand and then supplemental businesses in some of the developing areas on an opportunity by opportunity basis. That overall business, I wouldn\u2019t - it\u2019s certainly not as robust as our federal business but it is continuing to grow, as I\u2019ve shared with you on some of the conferences that we\u2019ve had in the last two or three months. I\u2019ll look at that at a 3% to 5% growth ongoing basis, nice, steady state. It ebbs and flows a little bit. U.K. right now is particularly strong, as an example, as we go through the new AMP6 programs and the new programs on transportation spending. The U.S. continues to be a little challenged but not as challenged as it was two or three years ago. But certainly the federal government spending in the support of transportation projects is a little soft, and so it\u2019s more about taking market share in the U.S. than it is about just riding a strong market. The Middle East, because of the things we\u2019ve talked about several times, the spinoff of their big oil projects to fund a lot of development of cities and - I\u2019m looking at their the - industrial facilities - thank you, always need a little help from your friends. And spinning off a lot of projects. And because of our cross-selling across our various lines of businesses, we\u2019ve been able to bring a lot of that work there in the Middle East. And of course, is - the government in Australia is using funding on infrastructure really to sort of fund the growth of the overall economy there. So that business continues to be strong and growing since we bought SKM a little while ago. So I feel strongly about the infrastructure business going forward and so continue to stay, like I said, 3% to 5%. Buildings business is pretty similar to the infrastructure business. It\u2019s a steady growth business. It is also global in nature for us. We have continued to do a lot of work in the U.S. for the federal government and various municipal governments and state governments, as well as hospitals and schools and things like that around the country. But as you well know, as a result of the acquisition of KlingStubbins a few years ago, we have opened ourselves up into the private sector part of that business. And so the opportunities continue to grow there. And then we\u2019ve been able to take that capability and spread it again into the Middle East, into the U.K., supporting their buildings business over there, and very definitely into Australia to support buildings business associated with things like airports and schools and hospitals there. So that business is a global business for us. And it is also continuing to grow, again, at a pace of about 3% to 4%, I\u2019d say, year in and year out for right now. So overall, it\u2019s a good day-to-day [ph] business and really highlighted by the federal spending, both in U.S., U.K. and Australia. And I would anticipate, although I won\u2019t promise, that our backlog will continue if what I said about the federal spending on those big projects beholds [ph] and the government doesn\u2019t delay their decision-making in the last part of this year which is always possible, then we should be seeing continued growth in our backlog going into \u201916 and in that sector. That\u2019s pretty much, Noel. Noel Watson : Okay, thanks, George. If we can go to Slide 14 and we\u2019ll wrap up so we can open up for questions. The portfolio diversity that both Gary and George talked about does remain a strength. And even though we\u2019re facing headwinds on oil and gas and some of our big plants have cut back some of their spending, the opportunities out there are strong, strongest I\u2019ve seen in a long time. And the backlog is strong. We\u2019re doing a lot of effort today realigning the cost structure with what we see the business look like over the next 12 to 24 months. I\u2019m a big believer in don\u2019t let an opportunity like this go by, so we\u2019re working hard in dropping our real estate cost and we\u2019ve already done several internal reorganizations that cut cost and make the company more efficient as Kevin was talking about earlier. We have adjusted the outlook for the headwinds we see. And we are positioning ourselves for a better second half and a good \u201916. And that\u2019s the game plan we have. As most of you know, I\u2019m not the long term solution of Jacobs and we are heavily involved in a CEO search. That has gained a lot of momentum. I spend most weekends interviewing somebody. I would say we\u2019re in the downhill run in that and we\u2019ll be coming to close on that probably over the next couple of months. If you turn to Slide 15, it summarizes mainly what I said. And I\u2019ll quit on that note and turn it back over for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, guys, good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning. Kevin, can you talk a little more about the decrease in the overall guidance that you had? Obviously you talked about the low end of the range last quarter which was 335 to - and the midpoint of this range is 305. How much would you say is currency versus slow burn rates and versus lower margin? I don\u2019t know if I need exact EPS but just thought process on that $0.30 lower at the midpoint. Kevin Berryman : Well, look, Andrew, I probably won\u2019t go to the level of detail that you would like but let me give you some kind of perspective as it relates to that. Certainly as communicated in our comments, we did see continued cancelations in certain parts of our business certain end-markets. And that is putting pressure on us again as it did in Q1 relative to our revenues. And while our underlying revenue stream was effectively flat, it certainly wasn\u2019t what we wanted to see in Q2. So we\u2019ll face some pressures as it relates to that backlog and when it starts to burn versus kind of the near term issues again associated with some of the restructuring - excuse me, associated with some of the cancelations. So believe that at the end of the day, we\u2019re looking at a situation where our medium and longer term views remain quite positive, certainly as it relates to the ability to win the work, as George and Gary were outlining. But also in addition to that, the prospects continue to be pretty robust and we\u2019re thinking that that translates well into our backlog in the back half of the year. And as you recall in Q1, we talked about that. So the diversity of our portfolio we believe allows us to exit some of these challenges in certain end-markets in a stronger position because of that. So I think if you look at our range, it\u2019s effectively - Q2 certainly was a little bit lower than what we would have originally anticipated. I\u2019ve talked about some of the drivers there. It is what it is. And so that\u2019s certainly part of it. But I think the other piece of it is really that we\u2019re not going to necessarily see the burn get to a level where it\u2019s able to offset some of the short term mitigating pressures that we see. And I think that that\u2019s the rationale for us to really be cautious in terms of our guidance. And I do want to ensure that you guys got the commentary as it relates to that guidance and that it does not include the costs associated with the restructuring. I know there were some questions relative to that but it does not. And while we hope to see some benefit on our restructuring this year, the bulk of that will occur next year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Kevin. And then maybe this is for Noel. Do you still expect - in the last quarter we asked you about overall backlog growth for the year and you said you can - you still thought that we could see overall backlog growth. Where are we today sort of with that question? And I guess the conviction level around public and institutional in particular sounds pretty high. Do you think that that can get you over the hump to have backlog growth this year? Noel Watson : Well, what I\u2019d say to you is that the sales process is working well. And so we are selling work almost at record level. The prospect list is long. These numbers on the technology group in particular, George, highlighted the 6 billion of proposal outstanding in your win rate is almost always been above 50% on those kinds of things. It goes well for a continuing backlog. And certainly, even with the headwinds coming out of oil and gas, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to damage that up, okay? I think we\u2019re going to continue to see backlog [indiscernible]. If we continue to sell like we\u2019re selling, it should be pretty soft. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And we just have a clarification. How much were cancellations in the quarter? It was 400 million last quarter. Kevin Berryman : It was at similar levels last quarter and those are primarily in Canada. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Noel Watson : Good morning, Jamie. Jamie Cook : How are you? I guess a couple of questions. And no, I don\u2019t know if it would be more fair for you to answer this rather than Kevin. But I just sort of sit here from covering you guys for a long period of time, we\u2019re going on a second sort of sounds like significant restructuring again with little color on the cost and little color on the benefits. I mean we just haven\u2019t seen this ever from Jacobs. So can you, while you don\u2019t want to give numbers and hopefully you\u2019ll give that next quarter, can you talk about what the issues are outside of the macro because you\u2019ve been through macro headwinds before? Is it related to the acquisitions that you\u2019ve done? Is it related to the org structure within Jacobs? Should we think about some changes to your business model relative to how Jacobs performed before? I\u2019m just trying to get some color because it just strikes me as - we haven\u2019t seen this from E&C companies nor have we ever seen this from you. So I guess that\u2019s my first question. And then my second question is related to the CEO search that\u2019s been going on for some period of time. You talked about interviewing people on the weekends. So does that imply it\u2019s probably there\u2019s a higher probability it\u2019s an external candidate relative to an internal candidate? Noel Watson : Well, right now, we\u2019re doing both. We actually interview both internal and external on the weekends. And we\u2019re moving forward on that. And right now, we just need to get closure on it. And what George would say, we are in end game. We\u2019re getting close to end game. We\u2019ve got the candidates we\u2019ve been interviewing. And we\u2019re moving forward with it. As I think we told you before, as fast as we can but we\u2019re being deliberate and we\u2019re going to do it right. But go back to the instructions from there. What we tend to look at, first thing we said is for these headwinds, we know we got - can we get some cost out? The answer is, yeah, we get some cost now. The real stamp is one place [indiscernible] a bunch of cost is going to come out there. And that\u2019s probably because we didn\u2019t get in the restructuring charge. But as far as consolidating divisions, we\u2019ve consolidated four divisions. And by the way, some of the costs were in this corner. Some are going to be in Q3. But those benefits probably aren\u2019t going to manifest themselves to \u201916. But I was taking a look at the business climate, looking at where we are, yes, some of the acquisitions played into this conversation. But I wouldn\u2019t say it was acquisition-driven. It was just taking advantage of a situation and saying, okay, what can we do now to make this company meaner and meaner and more cost effective going forward? And like I said, the business is there. Every big customer we got, the oil business is doing that and maybe they followed us, maybe we followed them. I don\u2019t know. But it seemed like the right thing to do and sitting here, I\u2019m absolutely convinced. And by the way, we started this right after the call phone call. We waited nine days to do this. A whole bunch of [indiscernible] is behind, that\u2019s all right. But the [indiscernible] will be all while coming. Jamie Cook : Are you at the point where you\u2019re questioning Jacobs\u2019 business model? Whether it\u2019s still the right business model? I mean the bear cases that the lull of large numbers are starting to work against Jacobs, she need more basis to grow, you need bigger acquisitions to grow, which every company goes through, right? I mean, is there anything you\u2019re contemplating within the business model like material changes or portfolio rationalizations, even though you don\u2019t want to communicate it today? Noel Watson : No. Simple answer to that is no. We\u2019re going to move in here one day. Maybe that person would want to make some changes, I don\u2019t know. But sitting here today, no. Jamie Cook : All right. I\u2019ll get back -- Kevin Berryman : This is Kevin and just let me make some commentary that relates to the initiatives that you are asking the question about, oh, we haven\u2019t provided a lot of color. We will provide additional color. As we\u2019re going through the process and gain clarity, we believe that the efforts that we\u2019re embarking upon are going to be percussive, that we\u2019ll get a very good return against it and we will provide that update as it relates to the Q3 earnings call. So there is more to come. And certainly, not ready to talk about the specificity of the full program because we\u2019re still working to it as Noel suggested. But it will provide a good return without a doubt. Jamie Cook : All righty, I tried. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Brian Konigsberg : Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe just first starting - I believe, Noel, you made the comment that you believe the cancellations in the process businesses are actually behind you. Maybe you could expand on that why do you have confidence that we won\u2019t support the later [ph] cancellation. Sir? Noel Watson : I would like Kevin to answer that because he made the comment. Brian Konigsberg : Oh, okay. There you go, Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Look, I think if you look at the Q1 and the Q2 cancellations that we\u2019ve had, and Gary certainly feel free to jump in if you have any additional color commentary. But we saw some fairly large, primarily U.S. process related in Q1 and in Q2 and other chunk and it was primarily Canadian-related obviously, which is as you guys well know is largely upstream-related activities. So as we\u2019ve been talking with our customers, ultimately we understand those cancellations. And while there certainly all these adjustments relative to backlog relative to the economics projects and whether they change over time or increase in capital and things are fluid always within the construct of that, I would say that we think the material impact relative to the change in oil prices is largely behind us. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be further cancellations just because of normal course process of people working through their projects. But the adjustments as it relates to the oil price situation is largely behind us. Noel Watson : Yes, I\u2019d just add in that. And I think the shelf chart and the oil price or some of these things to go on and some of these things that we\u2019ve taken out of backlog already being reevaluated by a customer. So I think those projects are there. It\u2019s only a question of when and timing. Brian Konigsberg : Got it. And just secondly, just on this commentary in regards to OpEx versus CapEx. So I think in your experience in the recent quarters, OpEx is actually health and wealth. I mean we\u2019ve been hearing some kind of contrary commentary maybe from some of the equipment providers saying, some of the project owners, where they can make quick cuts that\u2019s really on the OpEx side where the CapEx actually takes a little bit longer. I was just curious. So are you not seeing any of those type of trends impacting your business? And in regards to the backlog burn in the quarter, it slowed down. Was that OpEx or is that CapEx driven? Noel Watson : Gary, do you want to try that one? Gary Mandel : Yes, I would say with respect to OpEx, we look at that in several ways. One is we\u2019re inside the facilities providing day-to-day operation and maintenance and running the plant and repairing and replacing materials and equipment as needed. There\u2019s also OpEx associated with scheduled turnarounds. And some of our customers have deferred turnarounds from spring to fall, et cetera but they cannot defer them in perpetuity. We help plan their turnarounds. And so we\u2019re seeing the turnaround season coming up and we have identified the turnarounds, we\u2019re seeing that. What we\u2019re looking at on brownfield. And that may be where your equipment suppliers are commenting. On the brownfield, we\u2019re doing some refurbishment of equipment. We\u2019re sending it out, getting refurbished turning in, not necessarily replacement in kind with new equipment, new models. And maybe that maybe part of the difference of the different feedback you\u2019re getting. But we have boots on the ground in these facilities, doing the sustaining services, the maintenance, the turnarounds. Brian Konigsberg : Okay. And just one the slow back of oil during the quarter, that was CapEx oriented rather that OpEx? Gary Mandel : Well, to the earlier question as well, when the shock of the oil price and the cash flow became evident, we sat down like many of our competitors with our clients where we have these frame agreements. We reevaluated their portfolio of projects, they couldn\u2019t all go forward. While they have good ROI, they just didn\u2019t have the cash for all of them to go forward. So we helped them make decisions and jointly come up with which ones would go forward based on economics and which ones would not. Now, the ones that are going forward are continuing to go through all the phases EPC. So I think it was the recycle and the reset of taking 30, 60, 90 days to evaluate their portfolio of projects. Brian Konigsberg : Understood, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Good morning. Noel Watson : Good morning. Jerry Revich : I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about based on contract timing when you expect revenue burn to accelerate in the chemicals business. It looks like this was the second consecutive quarter of modest sales decline. Should we think about tough comps over the balance of the year or I guess based on a contract structure, when shall we expect that business to accelerate? Noel Watson : You\u2019re talking about our revenue burnout? George, why don\u2019t you take that here? George Kunberger : Yes, so if I look at what we have, it\u2019s going to be near the end of this calendar year, I would say, where the projects that we have will start to move into the field in a substantial way. Jerry Revich : Okay, thank you. Noel Watson : And that probably goes for both chemical and some of the biopharm work. George Kunberger : Well, yes, it\u2019s across the wires [ph] mostly. But that would be to across even to biopharm. But that was - mostly thinking about the process, that would be to across the biopharm as well. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then on the infrastructure business you\u2019re seeing a nice pick-up there. Can you just orient us how does the contract structure look like over the balance of the year? It looks like you\u2019re up about 14% revenue burn in the quarter. Are you seeing similar levels of strength heading for the back half of the year? George Kunberger : Yes. As I said, our infrastructure is a global business and so it ebbs and flows. When the U.S. gets a little softer - the U.K. is quite strong right now and it\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that - and that and Australia is driving a lot of our infrastructure spend. So, yes, I see it continue to grow incrementally over the rest of the year, maybe a little bit more in the U.K., a little bit less in the U.S., vice versa. But yes, I see that continuing to strengthen. It\u2019s a sort of a short burn business to a large - and maybe for us, there are some big large products buried in there. But for the most part, it\u2019s continuing spending from a processional service basis. So it\u2019s a book and burn business to a large degree. Jerry Revich : Okay, thank you. And lastly on this type of environment where your customers slow down their pace of awards, you typically have higher bid costs. Can you quantify how much of a drag that was to the margins in the quarter or maybe touch on it qualitatively? Noel Watson : I don\u2019t think we had any significant effects from higher bid costs in the quarter. We run that B&P which we call a bid and puzzle [ph] comp very tightly. And none of - we personalize [ph] that money very carefully. So the bidding cost did not go up. Jerry Revich : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal : Good morning, folks. Noel Watson : Good morning, Tahira. Tahira Afzal : First question is really for Kevin. Kevin, can you comment on the free cash flow outlook? Any color there would be helpful from a 12 to 18-month perspective. Kevin Berryman : Sure. I think as we probably talked in the past, we believe that the underlying business proves us the ability to open the way to have [ph] a conversion factor versus net income of at least 1. And we do expect that to be the long term dynamic. We haven\u2019t provided any context as it relates to the near term but I would suggest to you that certainly the trailing 12 months is a pretty positive number where we\u2019ve had a conversion factor of net income to free cash flow of 1.4x. So certainly that\u2019s not going to be the number we end up for the full year but certainly we have the ability to do that. And that will be our expectation to drive towards longer term. Tahira Afzal : Got it, okay. And Noel, if you look at what you talked about and we heard this from your clients on their goals about the supply chain, better managing costs, the big cost out of a project, how do you place yourself? I know you guys have saved your customers a lot of money. But some of your peers who have been doing larger projects clearly have a lot of experience from firsthand experience of building large projects. So when you go out to bid on some of those project management roles and design roles, are you kind of seeing the same amount of enthusiasm from your clients or are you seeing a little more competition there? Noel Watson : I would say that probably there\u2019s not a lot of change in my mind because of the model. One of the strengths of the model is that certainly with the core clients and the key clients is we define them. We are ahead of the game and know what\u2019s coming and what\u2019s happening and we do have a lot of long range contracts in place. It doesn\u2019t mean we get this work without competition because there is always competition. But I don\u2019t see that the work we\u2019re chasing changing dramatically. And I guess I don\u2019t see the competitive landscape changing significantly. George, will you comment on that? George Kunberger : No, I would agree. And as a matter of fact, we, over the last three or four years, have moved into a larger project space on an average spend than maybe we have traditionally been, to be quite frank with you. So almost the opposite of what you\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t want to over characterize that but we certainly have been moving into the larger project space on occasion where it makes sense for our ability to deliver. Noel Watson : And our clients. Tahira Afzal : Got it. Thank you, folks. Noel Watson : Yes, and thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. Noel Watson : Good morning, Steve. Steven Fisher : Your professional services bookings seem pretty low and I calculated a 42% year-over-year decline. But not sure of how the cancelations and net FX plays to that, so I guess, what do you guys have as the booking numbers in professional services and what\u2019s really driving that because I think professional services historically tended to be more stable during these volatile commodity price times? Kevin Berryman : Steve, this is Kevin. I\u2019ll take a quick crack at that. Look, the calculations, we\u2019re primarily, in the professional services, east of our backlog. So that certainly had a role as it relates to some of the numbers that you\u2019re alluding to. Steven Fisher : Okay. But, I mean, even if you add back $400 million, you\u2019d still be down pretty significantly and lower 1 on book-to-bill, so - I mean, are you not - is there a share issue going on? I think you just said you don\u2019t see a change in the competitive environment, but it just seems a little surprising that the professional services is kind of trending a little more weakly at this point. Noel Watson : Well, the sales side, Steve, is trending fine. But we have made these backlog adjustments. And I think if I had the data here in front of me, I could dice that, too [ph]. But on the big work we\u2019ve been selling recently with the exception of one big add where we got a big program going in the backlog, pro service new sales has remained quite strong. So this has got to be harbored in the cancelations and maybe even some backlog adjustments to go beyond the cancelations. Steven Fisher : Okay. I mean, can you give us what the actual new award number was in professional services? Noel Watson : I don\u2019t have that here. We\u2019ll have to get back to you on that. Steven Fisher : Okay. And just shifting gears, so in terms of the guidance for the rest of the year, what would you say are the most critical things that have to happen if they hit those numbers that you have now? And is it mostly those federal awards? Is it some of the chemical steps that you talked about sort of converting into - as revenues in the latter part of the year? What are the most critical things -- Noel Watson : Well, the federal awards will go to backlog. They probably won\u2019t have much effect on the business this year. They\u2019re next year\u2019s profits, but we\u2019re going to sell them this year. The thing that we have to do to perform the way we\u2019re talking right now, we just got to continue to sell well, find more of the book and burn work in the infrastructure. We need to continue to gather these maintenance contractors next year with these turnarounds as well and make a good solid profit there. A lot of what goes on toward the end of the year, to be honest with you, is already in hand. We just need to get it done. Steven Fisher : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard : Hi, this is Chad Dillard on the line for Vishal. I just wanted to go back to the comment about OpEx versus CapEx and the opportunities you see there. Just given that it seems like OpEx is holding up a little bit better. Are you seeing any increase in competition and seeing any pricing pressure on more of the maintenance side? Noel Watson : Hey, Gary, try it. Are there more competition on the maintenance side? Gary Mandel : I\u2019ll take that. There is competition. I do see where our customers are cutting back on their cost. As you\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re cutting back on the resources. They\u2019re looking to shrink their supply chain where we have a tender outstanding now for nine sites. There\u2019s actually five incumbents to be replaced by one contractor. And so the incumbents while they\u2019re competition, they don\u2019t have the wherewith or the breadth or depth to move into nine sites. We a proven methodology to take over new sites through a Friday to a Monday and transition the people in the work, et cetera. So while there\u2019s competition out there, I think if you\u2019re too narrow and too limited geographically or regionally, it may play against you as they\u2019re trying to consolidated these contracts to fewer people. We\u2019ve had a good win rate as I\u2019ve mentioned. We\u2019re continuing to win. I think our breadth and depth as well our safety performance is enabling us to move well in that. Chad Dillard : Okay. So in that same van [ph], I mean how are you bidding in terms of pricing? Are you seeing that you need to go a bit lower? Or are you able to hold and then maintain price? Gary Mandel : I think they leverage their spend. And you come up with some targets. The labor is the labor. We\u2019re able to leverage our tools, our equipment, our insurances, those types of things. We\u2019re able to arrange some transition cost and put some incentives in place. So it\u2019s a basket of things. If I share anymore, I\u2019m giving away our secret sauce. Chad Dillard : Got it. Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Noel Watson : No, we\u2019re not cutting our price dramatically to win the work, is that right, Gary? Gary Mandel : That is correct. Noel Watson : Thank you. That was good. That\u2019s the answer. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Whitman of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Whitman : Hey, maybe one for Kevin here. I was just - we talked to the customer [ph] earlier and I think since you\u2019ve come in as CFO, Kevin, you\u2019ve talked about the potential maybe the desire to take working capital out of the business. As I look at working capital balance here and forgive me, we don\u2019t have the full balance sheet so I\u2019ll say at some of these. But cash is down quarter-over-quarter pretty materially, but your working capital balance is not. Should we assume that you AR and [indiscernible] AR are up in this? Maybe you can give us some flavor on that. And is there any problem contracts or anything that we should be watching for in those AR if they are up? Kevin Berryman : A couple of comments. The first thing is second quarter of every year tends to be the low water markets that relates to the cash flow dynamics of the company. So if you go back and you look at history, second quarter tends to be a little bit less positive relative to the dynamic versus the full year. So we saw that again in Q2 so the figures for the cash flow on second quarter were somewhat similar to the Q2 results that we\u2019ve seen in the past on average. However, you have to take into account that we had the $140 million on top of that in terms of the share buyback and combination of those two things resulted in the cash flow dynamics you see and the ending cash and net debt that we saw at the end of the quarter. We do believe that there are opportunities for us to be more diligent in terms of the working capital. That is not easy to do. That\u2019s a lot of things that we\u2019ve talked about in the past as it relates to pick and shovel work and why being efficiencies and productivity in the enhancement have tool sets to support our teams in their ability to get reductions and receivables and get paid quicker. We\u2019ll look at the other side as well as it relates to accounts payable. And those initiatives are in the process of certainly beginning to be formulated and rolled out into the organization over the back half of the year. So not a lot in terms of the implications for our year-to-date results or the results in Q2, but I think collectively the teams around the globe think we can do better there. And to the extent that we have a small change in our working capital levels, that ultimately provide us a great opportunity and increase our free cash flow from our operation. So not alike yet. But we expect that we\u2019ll continue to develop that pick and shovel plan and be able to deliver and command the benefits longer-term. Andrew Whitman : Okay. Well, the question was on the margin percentages as we look out for the balance of the year. The margins have been I guess kind of holding up so far. It sounds like your pricing view is that it\u2019s - you\u2019re not cutting wildly price. You mentioned a little bit on the [indiscernible] and refining I think in the prepared comments. But just given kind of the guidance level, should we expect that margins are maybe down for the rest of the year? I guess they\u2019ll be doing by utilization until you can get the restructuring cost more where you want them. Is that a fair way to think that margins are probably down here for the balance of the year? Noel Watson : No, I don\u2019t think so. First of all, utilization is running almost record levels. I mean we\u2019ve dealt with those businesses already. So the utilization is doing just fine. As with pricing pressure, there always is. You certainly see what\u2019s happening in some of the oil field services company where they\u2019ve gotten [indiscernible] from the owners. And what we do in a situation like this is we try to find a way to deliver real value without cutting our price. Those negotiations are ongoing. And I think we\u2019re probably being reasonably successful getting that done. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be looking at significant drop in the margins this year. I mean I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you, it\u2019s a wildly optimistic business. But as you\u2019re sitting here watching what\u2019s happening, and I - we are getting better at getting more profitability into these jobs. I hope no customers are listening to that. But we\u2019re doing a little better in that way. And we are doing more full service jobs which contain a [indiscernible] even on the past sense [ph]. So I think all those tend to counterbalance each other. And we are going into maintenance season which one of those wall marks in business against the pro service base, the margin to be up. Andrew Whitman : Thanks. If you\u2019ll afford me one more, Noel, I wanted to get your thought - and this actually is kind of strategic as it relates to the CEO search. But just given that the end markets certainly in the near-term aren\u2019t giving whole lot of opportunities for organic growth, maybe they do over the long-term kind of dovetail into Jamie\u2019s question, is a 15% EPS growth target a free requisite for that CEO to buy into? Or it\u2019s a thoughtful CEO approach that maybe folks is more on higher return, slower growth. Is that a viable alternatives as you\u2019re looking for the right candidate [indiscernible]. Noel Watson : Well, I don\u2019t think - and I didn\u2019t mean to cut Jamie off. I apologize. What I would say that the relationship model issue, right now, we\u2019re not making any changes. New team comes in, reevaluates who knows. But it doesn\u2019t seem like anybody we\u2019ve been talking to think that\u2019s a bad idea. How you approach this, how to get a little more money out of the exercise? Here\u2019s a 15% pass\u00e9. You noticed we didn\u2019t talk about that today. We have to reevaluate that when we get this thing and the market stable up a little bit. Certainly double-digit growth with an acquisition program, it makes sense. It\u2019s in the cards [ph]. I don\u2019t have any doubt about that. But what is 15% which we\u2019ve hung on to for over two decades is a magic number. [Indiscernible] that question. Andrew Whitman : Thank you for your thoughts. Operator : The next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Anna Kaminskaya : Hi, guys. I just wanted to quickly touch on just your cash flow deployment. Can you remind us how much is left in your buyback and how do you think about given where our multiple are now for some of the energy assets you were previously interested in those. How do you way from your stock valuation versus going more maybe actively on acquisitions in the next year? Kevin Berryman : This is Kevin. So several quick comments. First, we are focused really in the near-term as it relates to the initiatives that we\u2019ve already discussed over the course of this call which is about driving alignment and simplicity into our organization which we think translates into our ability to have a stronger foundation which once we do do acquisitions and we believe that that fundamentally is part of our strategy longer term. We\u2019re going to be even stronger as it relates to delivering the benefits associated with those acquisitions. But in the near term, as we\u2019ve talked, we\u2019re continuing to, I would say, hit the pause button on the acquisition front so that we can focus on those other initiatives relative to restructuring. Having said all of that, we continue to be a nice cash flow business and consequently combining that with the fact that our share prices have been under pressure as of - versus historical levels. We will continue to be proactive in terms of the execution of our share buyback program. I think through the end of the second quarter, we had utilized, I want to say, $330 million-plus of our share buyback authorization, which is 500. So that eclipse that we were in - in the second quarter, certainly, we\u2019re going to be done relatively soon. And we\u2019ll certainly look to have other discussions with our board as it relates to next steps regarding that. Anna Kaminskaya : And just as a quick follow-up, what are your general thoughts on just introducing dividend, given you have diversified business model, pretty stable cash flow and I think one of very few NC [ph] companies that is not being dividend at this point? Noel Watson : Okay, this is my question. We, at the board, have alternately looked at dividend policy maybe every few years. And I think once we get a new chief executive onboard and we do look at the strong cash, we will probably do a total reevaluation. In fact, if I\u2019m still around, we will do a total reevaluation of what this means in terms of dividend policy versus stock buyback versus acquisitions and figure out how we handle that. So I think we need to get the new chief executive onboard. We certainly aren\u2019t going to do anything before that person shows up. And then I think a total reevaluation of what we\u2019re doing on that would be in place. Anna Kaminskaya : Thank you very much. Noel Watson : That\u2019s not a promise of anything, except we won\u2019t [ph]. Anna Kaminskaya : Great. Thank you very much for your time. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Dudas from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : I\u2019ll let you guys off here, it\u2019s been a long call, but I appreciate all the added color in the conference call from Kevin. And Noel, you said if you were around in the answer to that last question, what did you mean by that? Noel Watson : I will be involved. Let me rephrase it, okay? Michael Dudas : Thank you. I\u2019d figure as such. Good luck, gentlemen. Thank you. Noel Watson : Oh, you\u2019re done asking? Michael Dudas : Yes, that was it. No, no, you\u2019re exhausted. We\u2019re done. Get it going. Operator : The next question comes from John Rogers of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. John Rogers : Hi, good morning. Noel Watson : Good morning, John. John Rogers : A couple of follow-up things. First of all, maybe for either of you, in terms of the restructuring that you\u2019ve talked about, I know you\u2019re going to give us cost details in the quarters ahead, but are you anticipating any revenue impact? Noel Watson : Very marginal. It will barely be visible. John Rogers : Okay. And then secondly, I guess Noel, I mean, you talked about the strength and the opportunities is as good as I think you\u2019ve said in the past, but what are the customer - what\u2019s your sense of what are the customers waiting for? Is it the stabilization of energy prices, higher prices, better economic outlook? Noel Watson : Well, I think - by the way, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. And I got a 45-pag report sitting in front of me, eating my consulting group on exactly that issue. And the bottom line is I think they want stability. Whether the oil price is stable - and the oil price will stabilize somewhere. In fact, if anything comes out of this report I\u2019ve been reading, it\u2019s oil prices are going to stabilize. Nobody is quite sure where. We\u2019ve got a supply-demand imbalance now. We\u2019ve got excess oil coming out of the ground versus what\u2019s being consumed. Part of that is driven by slow economies, including China. Everybody blames China for this. And I guess I\u2019ll blame China but - so we\u2019ve got that imbalance. But we have had a very fundamental change in the dynamics of the energy market in the last five or six years. And I think what we\u2019re seeing now is there\u2019s going to be a rationalization of this and I think out of that will come stability. But that goes to both natural gas and oil. And we\u2019ve had - as a big oil company said a couple of years ago in one of the - he said - he thought the natural price for crude oil in a pure market driven economy was $70 a barrel. Is it still $70 a barrel now that fracking costs are now approaching $50? And so I don\u2019t think we know. I think the one thing I\u2019m pretty sure of personally is we won\u2019t see $100 oil borrowing ore [ph] ore or something. So I think we\u2019re going to see oil settle somewhere, probably above $50 and certainly below $100 but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not any smarter than anybody else. But I think the owners need stability. Anything moving from $100 to $40 to - or what was the low price? Thirty - I don\u2019t know. $100 to $40 back to $55 and our stocks track it every day, it\u2019s kind of embarrassing. But that\u2019s what happens with - I think they need stability. And so even though we\u2019ve been awarded projects, the startup phases are slow. John Rogers : Okay. Thank you. Oh, and Kevin, if I could real quick, what was the FX impact on backlog? Kevin Berryman : I don\u2019t have the number in front of me but ultimately, certainly given the impact, it certainly was - of the FX for the quarter, it certainly was an impact. I can get back to you on that number. John Rogers : Okay, appreciate it. Thank you very much. Kevin Berryman : My guess is that wouldn\u2019t be too far off of the kind of the revenue -- John Rogers : I understand. Kevin Berryman : -- perspective. But the mix is not too dissimilar. John Rogers : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Norfleet of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead. Nick Chen : Hi, guys. This is actually Nick Chen for Rob this afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering, as it relates to the SKM acquisition, could you just say if there\u2019s any details around additional cost savings there? And also, I know that you guys are hitting the pause button on acquisitions, but looking longer term, what are some of the potential opportunities you might see to expand in that market which sounds pretty robust right now? Noel Watson : Well, let me - you deal with the - I\u2019ll do the long term, you do the SKM. Kevin Berryman : Sure. As it relates to SKM, as you know, the SKM operations are fully embedded into the organization right now. And so we\u2019re stepping back as it relates to the pause button that we talked about relative to acquisition. And that is allowing us to drive alignment benefits and efficiency benefits into our organization through the simplicity and realignment initiatives that we talked about. So certainly SKM is part of that. It\u2019s not the driver behind it but certainly it is part of it. And so believe that that will translate into our ability to continue to have some benefits relative to the pieces of the business that as we can fit the same benefits from the rest of our total portfolio. So we\u2019re going to characterize it as SKM-specific. But certainly, it will be involved in the process. Noel Watson : Yes. And on the longer term, we\u2019ve sat here for years and said, if we want to be in the upstream energy business, would be a strange time to say that. But we actually have been quite successful and becoming fairly dominant. We have three energy business, first of all, Canada which obviously isn\u2019t doing great right now. But more importantly, where Gary said, [indiscernible] over $1 billion job for one of the majors. That\u2019s upstream as of yet. And we\u2019ve got a lot upstream energy work [indiscernible]. So we\u2019ll hope price stabilize, we\u2019re still going to need more energy, still going to [indiscernible]. My guess is sometime in the future, we\u2019ll be looking to that again. We\u2019ve been very successful more recently in acquisition in the government arena which have done extremely well. And so we\u2019ll probably be looking at things like that. And I would guess, we will always be looking at things geographically. After years of working, we finally bought a license in China and that\u2019s the only acquisition we\u2019ve done in the last three or four months. And we did buy that classic lights in China so we can actually be better able to serve our clients in China. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be going. Nick Chen : Okay, great. And this is my last question and then I\u2019ll jump back into the queue if there still is one. But just in terms of the Tier 3 standards. It seems like there hasn\u2019t been as much activity in that area as we might have expected. Do you have any sort of updates there? Kevin Berryman : Well, I think we\u2019ve talked now for a few calls, the Tier 3 lost a little bit of its theme because the individual owners had an opportunity to buy credits and extend the deadlines for incorporation. So while that work is still going on, it\u2019s certainly not at the pace and at the peak that we anticipated it was going to be when we first started talking about that about a year and a half ago. Nick Chen : That\u2019s great. Thanks so much, guys. Kevin Berryman : So we\u2019re getting near the end of our time. I want George to go on and sell some more business here, shortly. So we\u2019ll take two more calls. Operator : Okay. So that first question will come from Robert Connors from Stifel. Please go ahead. Robert Connors : Good morning, gentlemen. Can you hear me fine? Noel Watson : Yes, we hear you fine. Robert Connors : Okay, great. In order to be brief here, it sounded like the chemicals, the process backlog was up quarter-over-quarter [indiscernible] from 8% to 12% and largely [indiscernible] by chemicals. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk qualitatively about these projects if they were in fact chemicals other than just the fact that they benefit from lower feed stock prices. Were they ethylene based? Were they polyethylene and derivative-based? And commentary on that? Noel Watson : Well, I\u2019m not becoming [ph] smarter. George, you go ahead and take here. George Kunberger : Yes. They were certainly chemical-based to a large degree. And they were not necessarily directly ethylene and polyethylene based. They were secondary chemical marketplace. It\u2019s also a very robust marketplace driven by little cost of energy and general demands of products around the world. So they neither are those we were talking about were ethylene or polyethylene based. Robert Connors : Any breakdown as far as North America versus international? George Kunberger : Probably not. But that marketplace that I just described stays - well, the secondary marketplace stayed pretty robust in the U.S. and over in Asia Pacific Robert Connors : Okay. And then I don\u2019t know if you have this number in front of you or you just talked to it, but I\u2019m just wondering how much of your - when you look at your prospect list of chemical exposure, how much of it is for integrated companies, the IOCs of the world, where they\u2019re seeing CapEx pressures outside of just what\u2019s going on in the chemical space versus just pure chemical companies? George Kunberger : The answer to that question is a little hard to give you. There are as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, some very large petrochemical-based opportunity that some of the big innovative energy companies are talking about. And those are in the $20 billion kind of numbers. So that skews just on, just to answer question, that would skew everything towards pretty much the petrochemical-based. But that aside, I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty evenly based. It\u2019s been petrochemical and [indiscernible]. Noel Watson : Well, certainly some of these bigger oils we\u2019ve gotten are outside integrated oil structure. George Kunberger : There is one as I said, but a couple are based on our prospect perspective. Noel Watson : Oh yes. George Kunberger : There are some big projects being talked about. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware of it. Kevin Berryman : You put that into the mix, it skews everything dramatically. But that aside, I think they\u2019re more evenly balanced. Robert Connors : Okay, great. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : And the last question today will come from Justin Ward from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Justin Ward : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one, just a quick add-on to the CEO search question line, is it important to find a candidate with a proven track record of successful acquisition, timing and integration? Is that high on the priority list or is it still primarily about prioritizing the customer relationship skills? Noel Watson : Well, certainly any - it would be nice to have a proven acquisition record. But we\u2019ve got a [indiscernible] who knows how to do that. We probably are focusing more on other things. We still would like to get a person that\u2019s been on the job before. That\u2019s still one of our criteria. We\u2019re looking at people who\u2019ve got really good people skills, both down because we\u2019re a pure services business. So yes, whomever we bring in have got to have good people skills both within the organization itself and with the customers. We\u2019re not necessarily looking for a chief salesman. That\u2019s not what I\u2019ve got in mind. But we do have - sorry, George. But what we are looking for is somebody who\u2019s got good people skills, good leadership skills, a proven acquisition record probably draft down the list. Okay. Justin Ward : All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Noel Watson : Hey, guys [indiscernible] up. We do appreciate your interest. We do believe is solid. The sales are strong. The diversity is good. And we\u2019re looking forward to delivering on the products. And thanks to all who attended. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Berryman, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Roko. Good morning all and welcome to Jacob\u2019s Q3 earnings call. Before getting into the details on the call, I would like to pause and remind you all regarding our safe harbor statement. I guess I pulled the short straw this morning, so I get to read it. The company request that we point out that any statements that the company makes today that are not based on historical facts are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on management\u2019s current estimate and expectations and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of the company to differ materially from what may be inferred from the forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the factors, which may occur that could cause or contribute to such differences, the company request that you read its most recent earnings release and its annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 26, 2014. Including Item 1-A, risk factors, Item 3, legal proceedings and Item 7 management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations contained therein. And the most recent form 10-Q for the period ended March 27, 2015 for a description of our business, legal proceedings and other informations that describes the factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. So turning to our next slide, a quick outline for our call today. Noel will kick it off with some comments regarding the exciting news about the recent appointments of our new CEO. I will then go over the financial highlights. Noel will then discuss the benefits of our diversity and then call on George Kunberger, Andy Kremer, and Santo Rizzuto, who will each cover up the outlook relative to our end markets. Even though the lineup has changed a bit, unfortunately this morning we received some sad news relative to Terry, our new Executive Vice President of Sales, Terry Hagen, who has had a family emergency and I believe he is probably on a plane right now taking care of business. We certainly wish him well and our thoughts and prayers are with him. Of course, George is more than excited to fill in. His swan song as it relates to his last earnings call prior to his retirement. And finally Noel will then finish with some closing comments. And with that Noel, I turn it over to you. Noel Watson : Hi, folks. The really good news is that we have a new CEO, Steven Demetriou onboard to 17 of this month. We have got a brief summary of the resume on this slide here. And you will see that he\u2019s got a strong background in several of our key markets. He has got a really solid proven track record, but putting all that aside for a minute, the main thing that attracted us to Steve was his great leadership skill. And maybe the best reference I got in all of the effort I went through on this thing with a guy that used to work for Steve telling me you know, he made me a much better executive. And that is a really good testimony to Steve. We\u2019re really glad to have them on board. And I am really going to go back to being non-exec chair. And with that I am going to turn this back to Kevin to talk about the finances. Kevin Berryman : Thanks Noel. Okay, so, I am now on Slide 6, which is a discussion of our Q3 financial results. And so turning to those figures specifically. Our revenues for the quarter continue to see some pressure falling 10% versus the year ago quarter. It is important to note, however, that half of that fall was foreign exchange translation related. The remaining 5% fall was primarily driven by those end markets, where certain of our customers continue to see pressure including mining and minerals and oil and gas areas. In addition, we also saw revenues fall in chemicals. Although we believe this softness remains temporary in nature. The fall this quarter, as in previous ones, is driven by larger projects. Winding down, while our strong backlog of projects has not yet ramped up burn-wise. We would expect this to change over the course of 2016. This is resulting in a transitory period of softness in our chemical related revenues, especially as we compared to the peak periods of last year with last year\u2019s Q3 being one of those peak periods. On another note, roughly 70% of the fall in revenue was related to field services, which in turn was impacted mostly by lower passthrough revenues. We also realized positive below the line performance, resulting in our adjusted EPS increasing to $0.97 per share. This figure includes a headwind of 3% from foreign exchange. Also included in this figure is a $0.19 discrete tax benefit associated with a debt refinancing. Regardless of this discrete benefit in the quarter, we remain focused on reducing our go-forward effective tax rate from the levels we saw in the first half of 2015. Let me now make some comments regarding operating profit. Excuse me. It is clear that operating profit fell versus year ago, primarily related to our lower revenue for the quarter. The quarter versus year ago was also impacted by our stabilized gross margin percentage that has been running at a level consistent with our full year 2014 and half year 2015 level. Foreign exchange also had a negative 3 percentage point impact versus year ago. However, we are also seeing a gain in momentum associated with our restructuring effort, which is evidenced by our G&A following year-over-year. This is certainly helping mitigate some of the items noted earlier. Most importantly, however, is that you will note that both of our revenue and operating profit levels have stabilized on a sequential basis. We are also beginning to see momentum develop against our restructuring effort, which will drive more substative cost savings in the future. These savings importantly will support our operating profit trends in future quarters. All of this continues to result in strong free cash flow for the company. Resulting in our balance sheet remaining strong. For trailing 12 month free cash flow is well over $500 million and self drive a cash and net debt position of $554 million and $131 million respectively at quarter end. This certainly is especially impressive given our continued strong execution against our share buyback program. In fact, during the quarter, 118 million worth of shares were repurchased. All in all I would characterize the quarter as a stable and steady one. Turning to Slide 7, as promised in our last earnings call, I would also like to provide an update on our now formally announced restructuring program. The program is focused on driving business simplifications through improved alignment and cost reductions, thereby supporting the company\u2019s ability to better drive profitable growth. This program is primarily focused on our overhead related cost specifically in the areas of labor and real estate. As noted on the chart, the cost of the program are expected to total approximately $165 million to $205 million with benefits expected in the range of $130 million to $160 million. As you also note on the slide, the split between cash and non-cash for the cost and benefits of the program, indicate the cash payback relative to the program is well under one year. We also expect the program to be largely completed by the end of this calendar year. As a result of this timing, we expect that the bulk of the savings will be realized in 2016 although some savings are expected in this current fiscal year. Importantly, the savings in 2016 are expected to help support earnings growth next year. Of course, there are likely some potential \u2013 to next year\u2019s savings given investments we may want to consider to support our growth objectives. Turning to Slide 8, we are also pleased to announce the board has authorized an additional $500 million buyback program with a term of three years. It is expected that we will probably be more moderate in our execution of this program versus the existing one where we have almost fully exhausted the program within one-year of the board\u2019s original approval. This additional authorization is a clear indication of our confidence in the company\u2019s long-term cash flow and value creation outlook. Turning to Slide 9, and before turning it back to Noel, a quick review of our backlog. Total company backlog remains near record levels at $18.8 billion. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill at 1.03 remains fairly stable and it should be noted that the foreign exchange impact on this quarter\u2019s backlog versus the year ago figure is over $700 million. This indicates strong, constant currency growth in our backlog over the year ago period. Regarding professional services backlog, it also remains stable at $12.2 billion. Again, consistent with our story regarding total backlog, professional service backlog at constant currencies would indicate a strong increase versus the year ago quarter. So with that I would like now turn the call back to Noel. Noel Watson : Hey, thanks Kevin. Let\u2019s go to the end-market diversity slide. I was looking at this yesterday and thinking about the history of it. Back in the middle 80s when the business went through a dramatic recession and we basically operated in refining and chemicals in those days, and the business really went to tank, we decided as a company we would never get caught again in a single market downturn. So what you see on this slide is the end product, which is still an unfinished agenda. Less than half of our business comes from our origin s, which would be chemicals and refining and 55% more comes from other businesses. We have created a very diverse company, which operates in a wide variety of markets. And a slide that you don\u2019t see here is over a wide variety of geographies. So the company\u2019s diverse and markets are diverse and the geographies are diverse. This means as we have said many times before, we will never be hitting on all cylinders, but if we just hit on more than half cylinders, we are going to fine. So what I want to do now is turn the heavy process over to George. George Kunberger : Good morning everyone. Well certainly it\u2019s a tragedy that Jerry is off dealing with the emergency that he is dealing with today. But on top of that, I am disappointed that you are not getting a chance to meet Terry [indiscernible] a phone, my young protege who have turned this sales department over to. I have lots of confidence in him and leaving the go to a very nice retirement, very confident in my backfill. But for now you will have to deal with the old guy coming out of the bullpen. So let me try and adequately fill in for Terry. As we look at the process area, we find oil and gas and chemicals as we traditionally make it up. I would characterize that area as good. The market, not robust and euphoric certainly, but good, and more importantly I would say stabilized. An indicator of the stability of the marketplace say as compared to last quarter and the quarter before is that all of the major projects we had in all of these areas going into the third quarter of this year have not been canceled. They have all progressed through major financial reviews within their own organizations and have gone on to the next step. And so that\u2019s a very good sign that our client base is starting to get comfortable and understand the current economic conditions globally in this area. And indeed, there have actually been projects that were put on hold back a quarter or two ago that clients are calling us to restart and to think about get going and that\u2019s particularly notable in the refinery states. Quickly jumping down to the refinery area, you know, there is a general uptick in that area. Those refining margins around the world are up as I\u2019m sure you are well aware. There is a number of economic factors that are driving that. There is some growth and demand overall. There is certainly some opportunities in spot markets and taking advantage of low crude and track crude around the world particularly in the independent refineries, but also to a large degree even in the integrated oil company. So we\u2019re starting to see projects that are being put on the floor, to work off of, from a prospect perspective, that are going to drive I think continued growth in this area over the next certainly year. So I am pretty bullish about that. In addition, there is some ongoing stuff that our refiners have to face relative to safety, energy efficiency, et cetera that are continuing to drive project. So that space is good I would say and we will continue to relatively good going forward. The oil and gas, which we basically put in upstream and midstream type of projects, obviously we all understand the economics of oil prices, but again those are starting to stabilize. And one important area for us, of course, is in Saudi Arabia and so the Kingdom has continued to invest in their social economic programs. And so they\u2019re producing oil at a rapid pace and they are committed to \u2013 continuing to do that which is of course driving lots of midstream projects for us with Saudi Aramco. Even though areas like Canada and the oil sands continue to be very weak from a pricing perspective and large capital projects are certainly going to be few and far between, the sustaining capital markets for us is continue to be good. And more importantly being a very strong maintenance provider and craft service provider in Canada. We are actually growing that marketplace and continue to take market share. It\u2019s not going to move the needle tremendously, but it\u2019s certainly provides good stability in that marketplace for us. And of course of the fundamentals of the chemical business, despite Kevin talking about a little bit temporary softness in the marketplace, quite frankly the underlying fundamentals have not changed globally, driven by gas prices, they continue to be there. We\u2019re going into, as you well know, under the third \u2013 third round of methane crackers. There is a lot of ammonia and those type of projects out there. Now, Jacobs, as you well aware, plays secondarily in those things in OSDLs and derivative type of projects, which I will tell you those projects are pretty ample on our prospects slate. And actually while we have not announced some of them. We have actually been successful in \u2013 some fairly large projects in that space even in the last couple of weeks. So in the secondary chemical space, things like our Montana project that we did announced this last quarter, which is a significant project, the fundamental economics of those projects are very, very strong. And so we expect, certainly that the stuff we have not backlog, to continue to go through and \u2013 again as Kevin said, to drive the mostly construction type of revenues in 2016, but our prospect list continues to also be refad. And so I am pretty bullish overall in the process sector. I\u2019m not euphoric, but I am also pretty comfortable that it is going to be a strong part of our business for the next years to come. Noel Watson : Okay, thanks George. Andy, do you want to talk about [indiscernible]. Andy Kremer : Sure, Noel. Thanks. I\u2019ll start off on a high point. In the pharma/bio space, our clients are experiencing one of the most robust product pipelines in years. And this is driving a new investment and manufacturing capacity for their projects. In addition to that the emerging markets providing ample opportunity for growth. So we\u2019re seeing new projects and adding new projects to backlog in the U.S. and Europe and in Asia. You know with this surge in new projects, we\u2019re also seeing some competitors return to this industry. But as a market leader, with a deep capacity and deep \u2013 of experience, but we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from the investment trend. Turning to mining and metals, this business continues at kind of a low spending ebb due to capacity coming online. In recent years as you know, combined with the cooling demand in China have had a dampening effect on mining commodity prices. [Indiscernible] have generally curtailed capital investment to new projects, focusing instead on lowering the production costs and optimizing their existing facilities. But happily there are some exceptions for that as investments continue and some of the high value new deposits in Asia, Africa and South America and we\u2019re well positioned and are pursuing those projects vigorously although again some stiff competition. Another really bright spot for Jacobs in this market is that production rates remain high on these mine products and mining is a very high maintenance business. So investments of sustaining capital continues. And in some areas increasing as new capacity begins to wear in. And the performing sustaining capital type projects is a sweet spot for Jacobs across their portfolio, and so we\u2019re pursuing that sustaining capital business of mining with some very good successes both in South America and Australia. Turning out to the other industrial markets including power. As you know, power market remains interesting for us in the UK, Middle East, Asia and South A America. And while we are not a player in the lump sum turnkey market, power is a very big business globally and we've successfully targeted in growing our position in some select niches. The risk and reward are well balanced. In the and paper and consumer products, remains flat on a relatively low spending. We engaged in this business in alliance type framework so some of the biggest global players. And remain engaged with them as they invest in the end quality and efficiency upgrade project and some new investments in the emerging market. Noel Watson : Hey, thanks to Andy. Santo, you want to talk about public and institutional? Santo Rizzuto : Thanks Noel. Good morning everyone. Kicking off with national government, overall we see steady growth in this market, in particular the defense and security opportunities are quite robust. And continue to expand. We are well-positioned globally to take advantage of these. We see U.S. defense spend increasing to sustain some critical DOD priorities. Amongst these is the Asia Pacific pivot where we expect to see some significant investment over the last next five to ten years, followed closely by investments associated with a renewed commitment to NATO and Europe, as well as the Middle East. We also expected growth in the intelligence and cybersecurity markets. In recent events, we expect the U.S. Department of State to renew its emphasis on both physical and technical security at overseas missions as well as domestic facilities. And this is a strong Jacobs area. The nuclear market presents good opportunities as well and we're growing our position in both the nuclear cleanup in the U.S. and the UK and in Newbill for new papal generation in the UK. Here in the US we are also continuing to leverage our cleanup credentials and new opportunities with the DOE. So overall in the national government component of the public institution, we see good steady growth. Moving onto infrastructure, this continues to be a very strong market for us and will be for some time to come. Transport infrastructure opportunities, both highways and rail, remain solid in the U.S., UK, Australia, and New Zealand. And are growing in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. Funding is a topic of interest, particularly so here in the U.S. with the transport bill still in limbo. Nevertheless, we are seeing some states take matters into their own hands such as increasing gas taxes and vehicle weight fees, Washington State being a recent case in point, while others are considering alternative delivery methods including VBPs. So despite the funding issues, we still see steady growth in infrastructure and a solution to the federal funding program here in the U.S. will only further strengthen this market. So we\u2019re looking forward to continuing good growth there. The water sector is showing growing global demand especially in the UK, Australia, and here in the U.S. we expect the leverage the world-class skills that we have in both UK and Australia to strengthen our position here. The UK is currently our strongest market following our improved position in the AM6 procurement cycle last year and it has positioned us with some greater opportunities not only in engineering, but also in construction and maintenance. So overall, a good strong outlook for our infrastructure business. And finally, moving onto the buildings market, we see this continuing to be a steady growth area, as well. There are strong global opportunities in healthcare, airports and education, especially in the U.S., UK, Australia and the Middle East. Here in the U.S. we also see an increase in state, local and public buildings for k-12 [ph] healthcare, and corrections. Over the next 12 months we would expect multiple BMCM opportunities on bond funded public schools, hospitals, and jails across the country. And as in UK, we see a similar emphasis by government on schools and healthcare facilities. Last but by no means least, mission critical facilities and in particular data centers, which continue to be strong growth area for us. So good steady growth for our building sector. And summing up on public and institutional, it\u2019s a strong and steady market for us, we continue to see growth across the globe and especially so in the geographies that we are strategically located. Kevin Berryman : Thanks, Santo. I\u2019m going to move to the summary slide. Diversity, as I said earlier, both of the portfolio and the geography, remain a big strength. The backlog is solid. We have plenty of backlog. I want to comment on cost the reduction efforts. The guys have done a really good job positioning us for 2016. As I keep telling people, if you've got your costs really under control, you tend to control your market. And so I think we are in that position right now. I think, in our forecast for the rest of the year we got a range of $3.11 to $3.31 and that includes the tax benefit. And so with that said, I\u2019m going to turn this over to you guys for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin with the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal : Thank you very much. Kind a first question Kevin is to you just in regards to the restructuring plan. How should we think about in terms of how it flows through? Is some of it just for competitive, to deal with competitive dynamics that we are not going to really going to see it for the flow to the bottom-line? But really in maintaining may be your book-to-bill, et cetera [ph]. And how much is really going to really flow through and directly benefit the bottom line visibly? Kevin Berryman : Thanks for the question. And good morning. I will tell you that look you are getting at a question that specifically gets to what as a view of our 2016 earnings are going to be and clearly, we will provide that color and detail at the end of our Q4 earnings call. So little too premature to talk about that. Clearly though, there are two dynamics that we are driving towards to, to fundamentally allow us to have an appropriate margin profile. One is the day-to-day operations, mixed dynamics, cost reduction initiatives, which is day-to-day work that is done every day. And is hopefully result in our ability to offset any potential competitive pressures or cost pressures expected from our customers, and so on, and so forth. This restructuring is more about our overhead. And ultimately, we believe that we will be able to see, or reduced levels of G&A in 2016 versus 2015. Now will the full amount be seen on the P&L? Probably not. As I outlined in the call, in my prepared comments, certainly there\u2019s going be some expectations that we want to make some investments in our G&A, which will help support our ability to drive growth longer-term. So certainly, the short answer to your question, yes, we expect actually some P&L benefits and we expect that to help support our bottom line. But it is too premature to talk about specifics as it relates to that for 2016. Tahira Afzal : All right. Thank you, Kevin. As a follow-up question, in regards to your \u2013 book-to-bill has been fairly decent given market conditions and it seems to be stabilizing. How should we look at what is flowing through backlog? And I know Kevin you took a look and you scrubbed through backlog when you first joined. As you've become a little more familiar with it, any commentary on how that flows and how your views on the backlog profile have changed? Kevin Berryman : No, I think there is a series of dynamics that are occurring given market conditions, which are having some impact on our backlog. Certainly, I think that the situation on protests and whatnot is relative to the public speech and our federal government certainly is creating some more volatility than I would have expected originally, relative to how backlog gets in and stays and how options are renewed and so on and so forth. And clearly, the oil price dynamic has impacted various parts of our business as well. So other than that, I think the dynamic and the robustness of our discussion on a quarterly basis is robust. And I think that that translates into what Noel characterized as the backlog is there. And so it\u2019s really a matter of us working through some of the transitory issues. Chemicals being one of them that I outlined, where you see revenue currently being down, but our backlog looking really positive there and we expect that that\u2019s been transitioned to an improved revenue picture in 2016. Tahira Afzal : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Hi, good morning. Noel Watson : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Jerry Revich : It looks like the revenue burned for the buildings and market really accelerated for you folks. Can you give us just some more color on what\u2019s kicking in for you and where is the demand accelerating? Santo Rizzuto : Yes, I\u2019ll take. Noel Watson : Go ahead, Santo. Santo Rizzuto : Well, as I said in the comments, the buildings business for us is clearly a global business. So we\u2019re seeing growth in the markets that we have most strategically positioned in. Healthcare is one of the areas we\u2019re seeing growth, data centers and mission-critical facilities are the areas we\u2019re seeing growth. And this is the outcome of positioning that\u2019s taking place over, not just over the last quarter; this is long-term positioning of the global business. Our global building business cross-sell markets that we operate in. So particularly those are the areas that I would say that we are seeing strong growth in. Characterized in a social infrastructure as well, but those are the main ones. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then in downstream, can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing out of your U.S. customer base, activity was pretty low at the beginning of the year. I guess it sounded like, from their conference calls, that they are spending \u2013 I guess one might have picked up in the June and September quarters, it looks like that\u2019s not playing out. Can you just give us an update on the market? Noel Watson : Well, I think in the downstream marketplace in the U.S. there is a lot of variables that are playing into capital investments in our client\u2019s heads. I mean, first of all I think just the instability of what was really happening as a result of the oil prices and what was happening to the price of gas and what was happening to the light ends, what was happening to the shale oil business as far as feedstocks into the downstream business was moving pretty rapidly at it during the first part of this year. And I think we saw a lot of clients hesitate as far as putting money into their plant that\u2019s progressed or until they understood it. As I said now, things seem to be starting to stabilize. I don\u2019t want to over characterize that. But starting to stabilize as far as understanding the economic and therefore clients being able to make capital decisions with a fair amount of confidence. Today, the drivers are really increased margins, improved security and safety and improved efficiencies of these individual refineries. And they have \u2013 they are generating a lot of cash especially in the independent side. And so, they have the money to invest, driven mostly by the margins and our opportunities to make profit, which is a little different than what we\u2019ve talked about earlier, which was cheap feedstock, light-end feedstock for export purpose. So that the basic fundamentals have changed a little bit and they seem to be stabilized. Jerry Revich : Okay, thank you. And lastly on the restructuring program, I\u2019m wondering if you just flush out, from a high-level standpoint, the cash portion of it. Are we just adjusting across the end markets that you folks anticipate will be soft? Or is it across the whole company where we are reorganizing some of the functions? Any high-level color that you are comfortable sharing at this point just around the strategy there. Noel Watson : Perhaps I can characterize or reemphasize the characterization I made in the comments, preliminary comments. Certainly, we\u2019re focused on our overhead related costs and there are real estate and labor related targeting reductions there. Specifically, I would say that we\u2019re looking at \u2013 I\u2019m going to call it in the neighborhood of 15% impacting our overhead infrastructure in terms of labor, as well as probably of around 10% of our real estate related activity. So those are areas that we\u2019re focused on. We believe that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver against the savings, which I\u2019ve already made some comments on about how much of that will help support our earnings growth going forward. And really, effectively, we\u2019re kind of facing this on positioning ourselves for the future growth that we know we need to drive. So we\u2019ve actually had some realignment of our businesses, which is creating additional simplicity in our business and ultimately providing an ability for our teams to focus more on driving the business versus managing the metrics that we have in our organization. So all of that is good stuff, which ultimately would translate into our ability to drive incremental growth going forward. Jerry Revich : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi good morning. I guess a couple of questions, one sorry back on the restructuring again Kevin, will you \u2013 can you talk to \u2013 is the restructuring sort of \u2013 are certain end markets or geographies, more of a focus for Jacobs at this point. And then the other thing you talked about is the cognizant that you guys could also make some investments in the business. And I\u2019m wondering \u2013 you know if you could sort of explain, if you can give a little more color on that. I mean, as we think about how you are approaching the business, should we think about certain markets going forward, being more strategic versus history or certain geographies being more strategic? Or will your sales approach change? And the two, just sort of the types of projects you will be going after size, fixed cost, cost plus that dynamic. Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Those are \u2013 that\u2019s a mouthful their Jamie as it relates to the strategy going forward. Certainly with our new CEO, Steve coming in, those are going to be things that certainly we\u2019re going to be discussing with him. Relative to your color though request on geographies and what not, I would certainly characterize this as \u2013 across the geographic stand, we have seen opportunities to create greater efficiency and alignment and simplicity throughout the organization. So I would not characterize there being any particular area of focus. Certainly, there are some markets that are seeing greater pressure today versus two years ago. Given the dynamics associated with oil price and so on and so forth, which George is already characterized and talked to. So those are certainly areas where we\u2019re paying attention to. But other than that, ultimately, I wouldn\u2019t really characterize it being specifically and addressing a strategic initiative per se as it relates to the other kind of questions you\u2019ve asked. Those are certainly things we will discuss and work through with Steve when he comes on board. Jamie Cook : And then sorry just a follow up on the backlog, the backlog growth has been nice. It sounds like based on your prepared comments, you\u2019re still expecting backlog growth for the year. So I just want to clarify that. And are there any one or two major projects that will or end markets that will drive that. And then how do you, the backlog growth has been nice obviously it hasn\u2019t really translated into revenue growth because you\u2019d see \u2013 because the burn rates have obviously been slower for reasons you have outlined. What risk do you see that that continues over the medium-term are into 2016? Kevin Berryman : Look, I think, back to one of the questions that was asked earlier one of the as I ramped up on the business. One thing that is certainly very clear in my mind is how the backlog ultimately transition and the timing of such into revenue. Certainly at the longer than I would have certainly originally anticipated. And that\u2019s probably exacerbated by the dynamics that I\u2019ve already alluded to. I think at the end, we really fundamentally feel as if there is the strength in backlog. And as we project in the balance of the year, the timing of some of our wins in sales could be impacted by our friends in the public space government. And so, we would certainly say the prospects are there. The benefits are there whether they end up getting booked this year or they leak into next year that\u2019s an item of \u2013 kind of volatility that could impact the year end numbers. But we feel good about it. I think that results in our backlog. So I'm not maybe growing above the record backlog figures that we had at Q1, but certainly continuing to be quite robust, especially given the impact of foreign exchange. Jamie Cook : All right, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Cummings Bird of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Brian Cummings Bird : Good morning. Noel Watson : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. George Kunberger : Good morning. Brian Cummings Bird : Good morning. Maybe you touched a little bit more on the chemical softness you noted. Is that just a reflection of owners taking a step back and reconsidering the markets? Or you said the viability of the project is still very good. So what\u2019s holding up the progression of some of these projects you\u2019re noting? Kevin Berryman : Let me kind of make a comment on the softness angle and then I\u2019ll reemphasize the comment that George made and then ask if he would like to add some additional color. The softness is in our revenues. And it really is about a situation where our backlog was robust. We have a lot of large projects. Those projects are winding down. And consequently, the revenue in the short-term is being impacted. Characterization that George outlined in the space going forward is that the prospects are good. The dynamics and the economics associated with the space are quite positive. And we think that there are a lots of growth opportunities in the chemical space, some of which are already in our backlog, some of which we believe will be added to backlog over the course of the next few quarters. The dynamic of what I would call a transitory situation is that those revenues are falling off as those big projects are coming to an end and the revenue \u2013 and the backlog is being completely burned off. And the backlog on the new items, which George characterize is being strong, is ramping up. The projects are there. And we think it is going to start to show some benefits in our revenue line over the course of 2016. George any additional color? George Kunberger : Yes, I\u2019ll just add, as I said earlier, if you look at the first half of this year, of our fiscal year, again the instability of the decision-making process with our major customers caused a lot of projects to be either canceled, delayed, or certainly slowed down. And so that added to what Kevin was saying. I mean, that has started to stabilize. I mean decisions are now going forward as the projects that are \u2013 that we\u2019re decided to go forward are going forward that ones that we\u2019re canceled or being reconsidered I would say. In some cases, starting again - more in the refining space and the chemical space. So it\u2019s more that. And that stability and the understanding of the economics going forward, I think is a more comfortable space for our clients and I think we\u2019ll see more steady continued growth in that area. Brian Cummings Bird : Great. Thanks for that. Secondly \u2013 actually two quick questions. Maybe just give us an update on pricing and terms and conditions that have maybe developed in the quarter that have changed versus the last couple quarters. Secondly, did you just comment on the arbitration with Motiva that's noted in your 10-Qs and Ks. It's a rather large \u2013 they are asking for a rather large number, $7 billion. But there's not a whole lot of detail behind. If you can provide any details on the call, that would be really, really helpful. Kevin Berryman : Okay, this is Kevin. I will take a stab at the pricing dynamic and perhaps Noel wants to make a comment on the Motiva situation. Look on pricing, certainly the end markets where they\u2019re seeing some pressures, which is in the oil and gas space obviously that is certainly an area where we are seeing some pressure from our customers and ultimately that\u2019s required us to negotiate and ultimately look towards it, refocusing our efforts and restructuring to ensure that we maintain our gross margin profile longer-term. Having said all of that, the gross margin number that we\u2019re seeing in the quarter specifically is kind of trending at the full year 2014 level. And as I suggested in the comments, prepared comments, in the first half of 2015. So we are able to offset that through the normal course of just being good at running the nuts and bolts of the business. So certainly, there is some pressure in certain areas, other parts there are less pressure but that\u2019s the normal course of the business and we\u2019re looking to ensure that we\u2019re able to drive a certainly an offset to some of those pressures in our gross margin levels going forward. And perhaps, Noel, I\u2019ll turn to you for any comments on... Noel Watson : Yes, let me talk about the Motiva thing is about as well explained in the date as we\u2019re going to make it. Nobody at this table is in a panic over it. It will go through the normal course of events. But I don\u2019t think it is appropriate to say a lot more than that because we spent a lot of time writing what we wrote and giving absolutely full disclosure. Brian Cummings Bird : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Thanks. good morning. Noel Watson : Good morning, Steve. Steven Fisher : I know. Just trying to think about the drivers of earnings going forward. Not asking for guidance, but really just conceptually you have been able to keep backlog pretty flat sequentially. Are you expecting backlog to grow to drive top line growth? Do you see any margins story, or is this really going to be about cost savings and buybacks going forward? Noel Watson : Let me do that. I get to answer a question. What I would say generally is that, the first thing in the cost savings \u2013 I think Kevin said it quite well. We will get some kick out of that. I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about that. I think as far as the margins go, I think the margin rates have stabilized. Certainly, the business seems to be much more stable then it was six months ago, when we had oil going from 100 to 110 who knows where \u2013 back up and down and it stabilize. So that\u2019s giving our customers a little more certainty.  And it is not that they can\u2019t deal with $50 oil. It is hard for them to deal with the uncertainty. I think as we move forward in the 2016. I think the early part of 2016, we are probably going to see margins a little more flattish. I think getting a kick out of the savings and we are getting out of the restructuring. But I do expect most of our markets \u2013 and some of these markets, particularly infrastructure and the public and institutional markets are quite strong right now. So I think as we move through 2016 we\u2019ll see a nice recovery. And uptake you know probably won\u2019t make a point around 2016. But I don\u2019t think we know at this time, it goes right in the middle of 20%. And that is probably the best answer we can give there. Steven Fisher : Okay. Thank you, Noel. That is helpful. It seems like new awards and professional services have downshifted quite a bit year-over-year. But it is hard to tell what the currency impact is. So from what you are seeing, are your professional services bookings running flat, up or down, year over year? And what is the trajectory there that you see? Noel Watson : Well, as characterized in the comments, the \u2013 the professional services relatively stable year-over-year. But you got to remember there are $700 million of foreign exchange impact. So the underlying constant currency build is real. And I would characterize that in the professional services as well. Steven Fisher : So was the $700 million entirely related professional services? Kevin Berryman : No. Noel Watson : No, no. Steven Fisher : So can you give me the split of\u2026 Noel Watson : So if you give the split of the business, that is relatively close, close enough for government work as it relates to the split. Steven Fisher : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Alex Rygiel of FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Rygiel : Thank you, Kevin. To take that last question another step further. If you were to look at the foreign currency impact by sector, being public, institutional, process and industrial, how does that breakdown? Kevin Berryman : I don\u2019t have that information. And we don\u2019t tend to really disclose that level of detail anyway. Alex Rygiel : Fair enough. I noticed that in your prepared remarks you didn't mention anything about telecom. Is this an area you are still interested in? Or is that an area you are deemphasizing? Kevin Berryman : Would not characterizes deemphasizing, but certainly it is part of our business. And consequently, we have not made any decision to deemphasize it obviously. And its incorporated into our growth algorithm going forward. Alex Rygiel : Great, thank you. Kevin Berryman : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard : Hi, This is Chad on the line for Vishal. I just want to go back to that cost savings. So, of that $130 million to $160 million how should we think about the breakout between 2015 and 2016? Kevin Berryman : We didn\u2019t provide the specifics and details relative to that. But certainly the bulk of that is going to be 2016. And it depends upon ultimately, how the actions ultimately \u2013 when they actually result in final kind of efforts. And, as you know, if you look at the total costs versus the cost that we have incurred to-date on the restructuring, a lot is happening over the next six months. So probably seeing some benefits in 2015 \u2013 the bulk of it is really going to be driven into 2016. What that characterization of percentages certainly well above two-thirds, I would say. And other than giving you additional clarity, versus that number, I think we will just stick with that. And certainly, tell you that whatever we have embedded into 2015, certainly is incorporated into our estimate that we have given you for the full year of 2015. I should also make the comment that didn\u2019t actually make any comments in the prepared remarks. But you should be aware that we actually have an additional week this year. So we have a 53 week year given the dynamic of our catch up on every year \u2013 several years or so. We have a 53rd week. We don\u2019t think of it as being a material impact. But it is incorporated into our expectations for the full year. Chad Dillard : And then on the national garment side, could you just talk about the size of the project pipeline? And I guess your expectations on when you think more bookings will start to accelerate over the next year or so? Kevin Berryman : Well, I think in national government, the larger proportion of it is going to come from the defense spend, that we are seeing \u2013 the defense and security. Some of those DOD priority that we were talking about. The numbers that we have seen, talking in terms of capital investments or in a things opinions \u2013 a number of years. We expect to see good growth in 2016 in that space and beyond. And similar comments to the nuclear market, both in cleanup and in new build in the U.S. and in UK. Noel Watson : Yes. The only think I would add there, we still have a \u2013 almost a record number of proposals outstanding. They are going to get adjudicated over the next, I guess, three to six months time guys that probably will be\u2026. George Kunberger : Yes, no I think that\u2019s \u2013 that is Jamie, asked the question a while ago. That\u2019s the one area in our prospect plays there. I think we talked about this before in this conference call. That has some variability from a timing perspective and intensive decision making except for a \u2013 I would like to talk about and give the answer decision making particularly in the U.S. on some of those growth prospects that you talked about here now. Those definitely slide fourth quarter or first \u2013 fourth quarter, first quarter next year talk about placement time that is the one variable. Noel Watson : There is \u2013 there are a lot of prospects out there it\u2019s kind of went through and the defense spending doesn\u2019t seem to be going away. No, and we certainly have an opportunity to grow that piece of business. Chad Dillard : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Thank you. Good morning everyone. And George congratulations on your upcoming retirement. I can't believe they let you get away. George Kunberger : Well, it took a little doing, I\u2019d tell you but thank you very much for your comments, Mike. Michael Dudas : You're quite welcome. Noel, what did you and the Board learn about Jacobs over the past six to nine months, given -- hiring for Kevin and also with the recent hiring of Steve? George Kunberger : Well, we learned our brand is good. I would say that, I mean, it was kind of night during the executive search for \u2013 came back and they did come up with good candidates who are really interested in the job. Ultimately Steve is really interested in the job. We were really interested in Steve. And so it is going to work just fine. I think we learned a brand in Scotland. You all know with something a little bit. I think that what's going on today with restructuring, it going to put us back in position of being a really solid cost for this year and going to allow us to control the market like we like to. And so we can go get what we want to get and still make money. And that is where we are trying to position the company. I think the board feels good about it. Even in the engagement of Steve. Every one of the board members interviewed Steve. And every one of the board members wanted to hire him. So he's got a big onus on his back. I know he is listening to this. So anyway, that\u2019s what I know, Mike. Michael Dudas : I'm sure he is. That's all I had for you. Good luck, gentlemen. George Kunberger : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question comes from of Andrew Whitman of Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Whitman : Hi. I wanted to ask a question on the restructuring. And I guess I wanted to understand when the charges started? You've been taking restructuring charges mostly every quarter for a while now. Did it just start here in the third quarter, Kevin? Or is the range, the $165 million to $205 million, does that start in the fourth quarter? What is the timeframe that covers? Kevin Berryman : The timing, Andrew, as it relates to the restructuring \u2013 really we had a really small amount of money that we spend in the second quarter of this year. That is ramping up. We spent a little bit more in this third quarter. And then of course, given the timing and the magnitude of the cost estimate that we\u2019ve highlighted \u2013 that means a lot got to happen in this quarter and next quarter, for us to ultimately finish by the end of the calendar year. So this is really going to end up being \u2013 largely, I would say a three quarter initiative \u2013 leaking into the first quarter of next year. So second, third and fourth quarter. And of course there may be some lingering small things that could leak into beyond the calendar year. But I think that that is kind of the framing and the bookend as it relates to how we\u2019re executing against the costs. Andrew Whitman : That\u2019s helpful. Kevin Berryman : There is variability \u2013 there is obviously Andrew because you got to work through work councils on labor issues, you got to work on realigning the organization and actually getting out of real estate that ultimately is going to be part of the restructuring. That just doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Andrew Whitman : Got you. So I've got in the last two quarters about $58 million of restructuring. Does that sound about right? Kevin Berryman : Sounds about right, sounds about right. Andrew Whitman : As you look at kind of the benefits here, where do you see \u2013 it sounds like you are very focused on the overhead line, so that seems like its mostly going to come out of the SG&A line. Do expect to benefit from the gross margins as well? Or is that mostly based on the margins that you are putting in backlog? Kevin Berryman : No. There is some gross margin benefits. Although you should consider it, basically driving SG&A reduction? Andrew Whitman : Got it. And then another one for you, Kevin. You mentioned that you saw some opportunity to keep the tax rate down. I would be curious to some of your thoughts. And it looks like maybe you even saw some of that here if you exclude the tax item. It looks like maybe the tax rate here in the third quarter was a little bit lower than we expected. First, can you confirm that that was the case? And can you second talk about some of the things that you've found since you have been CFO to drive that lower and maybe how much lower you think you can get it structurally? Kevin Berryman : Look I think we are getting proactive as it relates to addressing this particular cost item. And proactivity translates into, I think, our ability to work the number down over time. There are certain other things that are working against us. Certainly, if we have more business in the U.S., that translates into higher tax rates and so on and so forth. Ultimately, we, and I, specifically, believe that there is an opportunity for us to drive that down over time. If taxes are an area that are volatile in nature because you will find things that come out of the woodwork, whether it is chances taken by regulatory authorities or tax authorities around the world, which can give you a plus or minus, which is difficult to predict and understand. But, I do think, if you take away \u2013 kind of the discrete item that we talked about, in terms of $0.19, the year-to-date kind of operational tax number is different than what you would have seen a year ago, for example. And we think that we are going to look towards trying to drive that going forward. Andrew Whitman : I will leave it there. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of BBandT Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Adam Thalhimer : Hi, good morning guys. Thank for squeezing me in. Noel Watson : Good morning. Adam Thalhimer : I was just hoping maybe Noel you could talk a little bit more qualitatively about the 2016 outlook. Because even going back to your comments about the end markets, how you don't need all of the end markets to be strong. It seems to me you are really only complaining about 10% of the business, the direct oil and gas and then the mining. So if 90% of the business feels pretty good -- why couldn't 2016 be a barnburner year? Noel Watson : Yes, well that\u2019s good. I think it is an interesting conversation. George talked about it. Maybe I talk about it a little bit. The commodity price, unless if you want to call that, copper 235 or whatever it is an oil at 50 or whatever it is \u2013 has made a lot of customers particularly the non-government type thing. And when they think, they slowdown. As they tried to get certain on what their end markets will go. There is no logic on Earth, for instance, for there to be any effect on the chemical business with the drop in oil price, in my mind. Except a lot of the companies, they are suffering cash flow problems are big in chemicals. And so when you look at it like that, these guys have got to sort out in their own minds where they are going. So even though the direct result is on oil and gas, maybe on refining somewhat, it has to spill over in chemical. And I am convinced we got spilled over in other places. So as we get little more certainly into the world, I think, these customers are going to be more confident \u2013 more confident in their ability to generate returns. And I think we\u2019re going to see neat update, as we go through 2016, providing the world doesn\u2019t fall apart somewhere else. But I do believe at this point in time, as George said it best, they are already coming back to a single, maybe we want to restart this. What do we do with this? And even though we\u2019ve got some really big wins in the chemical business, some of which we haven\u2019t even pressed. We\u2019re moving on a phase at a time. And so there is dip in the revenues where some of the work got worked off. We\u2019ve got a whole bunch front end packages that we are positive will get built. But we\u2019re getting released a piece at a time. And so I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in 2016. So I don\u2019t look at 2016 as being a barn burning year. But I certainly look at 2016 as being an up definitely. Adam Thalhimer : That\u2019s great color. Kevin, really quick - maybe you said this, what are your expectations? Or what should we be expecting for additional restructuring expenses next couple of quarters. Kevin Berryman : Okay. So the total cost is somewhere in the $160 million plus to approaching couple of $100 million, We've done about a little less than $60 million. So the math is pretty easy to compute. So it\u2019s a pretty big number over the next couple of quarters. Adam Thalhimer : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Anna Kaminskaya : Hi guys. Good quarter, I think, stable is very good in this environment. I wanted to touch base quickly, I guess go back again on the refining. When we are talking about improving pipeline, are we talking more about outage work, maintenance work? Or are companies actually talking about adding capacity? And if you could provide more color on by end market? What are you seeing by end market \u2013 sorry, by region for refining? George Kunberger : Yeah in refining. So as I said, it\u2019s a wide variety of things, I mean it certainly is \u2013 we look at the Independence, trying to take advantage of low oil prices, captured crude that they can get cheap on the spot market, their own inventories that they build up and being able to take advantage of that. That\u2019s certainly an impact of it. As they go ahead and decide to spend the capital on some of these crude flexibility types of projects, they are going ahead and spending the money on energy efficiencies, upgrades, as well. And then as we look at the ISA-4, which is going to be a pretty broad spend over a long period of time, not just in the downstream refining market. Kevin Berryman : ISA-84 is \u2013 it\u2019s not a law in the United States just yet. But it is a policy that says listen, if you are running a refinery or chemical plant, you need to look at the safety overall of your facility and to be sure it is incompliance with standard OSPA policies and where the industry is going. So capital decisions are being made on \u2013 do we go ahead and upgrade the safety of this facility? Do we take the risk? Because there might be an event \u2013 public exposure or public outcry as a result of chemical event increasing as it should. And so a lot of our clients across the board are making decisions to go ahead and look at their facilities and upgrade from a safety perspective, a process safety perspective. This is a law and other parts of the world. Say as an example, in Singapore, where it\u2019s regulatory driven. So the pressure is on actually regulatory in the U.S. as yet. But certainly there is strong social and political pressure to go ahead and spend us money. And some are big clients, Chevron being an example, now have announced some big spends and big programs to go ahead and look at their facilities. So that\u2019s an element of the refinery spend as well as the upgrades on the crude space and flexibility on the crude space that I talked about earlier. Anna Kaminskaya : And when do you think we might see something in backlog? Is it something that might come through in the fourth quarter, or is it more of a 2016 story? Noel Watson : Yes, I would say it will be early at first quarter 2016. Of any significant increase in backlog because as Noel said, even these projects are being released Phase by Phase and we are relatively conservative on what we backlog on to make sure these projects are really going to go forward before we commit to them. Well I would say be more early 2016 than any other major second quarter 2016 from a backlog perspective. Anna Kaminskaya : Okay thanks. Noel Watson : Well it is going to be a big efforts, folks. Anna Kaminskaya : Just a quick cleanup on the processes backlog. I think you said you had fewer cancellations. Would you be able to quantify and where are those cancellations coming from? Noel Watson : Thanks for the question, Anna. But we\u2019re out of the cancellation and disclosure mode. We don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Kevin Berryman : Probably, we are doing better. Anna Kaminskaya : And then we can quickly touch on just on your M&A outlook. It just sounds like it was such a big share repurchase that we should assume that acquisitions are pretty much on the back burner for now. Noel Watson : Let me deal with on. We have had it on hold. We made one little bitty acquisition during the first of the year. Something we have been working on for a couple of years. They have got the design license in China. We\u2019re just waiting \u2013 Steve has got to get in here, he\u2019s got to look at the business. Certainly, at some point in time, we will be back in the acquisition business. But I would guess that it will take Steve a quarter or two, as he looks at the business, decides what to do. But certainly, at the board level, we know we got to go back and I think as Kevin said, the pace of the stock repurchase is going to be, at least now, considerably less than the last one. And so, we\u2019re really looking at spreading that money over the three-year period, unless something dramatic happens. Anna Kaminskaya : Okay. Thank you very much for your time. Great quarter again, great execution. Noel Watson : Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Chase Jacobson of William Blair. Please go ahead. Chase Jacobson : Hey, good morning. So I just wanted to clarify on the tax rate. I think it was in the mid-20%s this quarter and just under 30% year-to-date. I know you are working on some things, but should we be expecting that kind of historical low 30%s tax rate going forward? Or do you think you've now got it to a place where it is going to stay in the mid to upper 20%s going forward? Kevin Berryman : If you look at the numbers, Chase, through the first half, we were kind of in the range of 31.5%. And so if you take the benefits in the quarter, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that the quarter itself is a sustainable number. But, if you look at our year-to- date, excluding the discrete item that we discussed, it is approaching the 31% number. Whether or not we\u2019re going to get all the way to the 31% number, there is some volatility there. But certainly we believe we can get it down versus the 31.5% that we saw over the first half of the year. Chase Jacobson : Okay. Kevin Berryman : Okay. Chase Jacobson : Okay. And then just another one. Not specific to the details of the restructuring, but as it relates to it. Obviously there is pressure in some markets. But overall your commentary, you talk a lot about stability. You talk a lot about growth opportunities. So it sounds like the restructuring is more in response to the cost pressure from the customers and the competitive environment. I may have missed it but I don't think there has been a lot of talk of the competitive environment. So can you just comment on that and maybe include if the competition is coming mostly from the small, the smaller or regional players? Or if you are also seeing it from the larger project companies that are trying to fill capacity, given the weakness in the large projects out of the business right now? Noel Watson : You George? George Kunberger : Listen, I think that \u2013 excuse me. Fundamentally, we will strive to run our business from a cost perspective to make good business sense and to drive value to the shareholders. It is not necessarily in response to the competition. We would make these decisions independent of the competition. As Noel said earlier, as we continue to keep our cost and that\u2019s been the entire legacy of the company, at a low level, it gives us a lot of flexibility in a competitive world. But it is not necessarily to drive the decisions that we\u2019re making here today at all. It is just good business. Kevin Berryman : For a guy that\u2019s retiring, I completely echo George's comments. George Kunberger : I taught Kevin everything he has learned since he has been here \u2013 I don\u2019t think else to say. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Volshteyn from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Volshteyn : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Noel Watson : Good morning. Jeff Volshteyn : I know we are running out of time here so I will be efficient. Just a few housekeeping questions. Kevin, just to clarify on your comment on investments in the restructuring process. Is there any type of really direct investment included in the numbers? IT systems, you know whatnot. Or is it purely cutting? Kevin Berryman : No, we \u2013 it\u2019s a good question Jeff. Thanks for it. Yes we\u2019re investing in our systems right now, as a matter of fact. It is an area that I think we can collectively we can improve upon and help support the incremental simplicity and alignment that we\u2019re looking for as part of the restructuring. So there certainly are investments that continue to occur. Jeff Volshteyn : And that is helpful. On the guidance, the EPS range went up and then slightly narrower then it was before. But it's still rather wide for being a one-month out from the year-round. Kind of a two part question. Are there any key areas of uncertainty in your guidance? And maybe you can help us think about some of the underlying assumptions for the fourth quarter guidance. And maybe just foreign exchange and the share count and the tax rates? Kevin Berryman : Well look, the guidance is what it is, if anything, I would say \u2013 it is tending to be more narrow than what Jacobs has historically provided. So I think we\u2019re actually giving more closer to a figure, but I think it is a positive. Jeff Volshteyn : And the underlying assumptions then? Kevin Berryman : We\u2019ll look all of the things that you have alluded to. Certainly are items that can impact the number. Certainly the pull through on revenue. Certainly dynamics relative to the effective tax rate. Certainly dynamics relative to foreign exchange. Certainly all of those dynamics timing of ultimately when we\u2019re able to execute against the restructuring and where we might assume that there is something that occurs now and it ends up getting delayed for another month. The savings associated with the restructuring don\u2019t ultimately come into the numbers until later on in the quarter. All of these are factors that would contribute to the range that we have alluded to. Jeff Volshteyn : Okay and then just on the share accounts let me ask it different way, what share accounts should we use for the fourth quarter, following your share buyback in the third quarter? Kevin Berryman : Well, look, I think it would be appropriate to utilize the terminology that was used, i.e., it\u2019s a three year term. Jeff Volshteyn : Okay. All right. Thank you. Kevin Berryman : You\u2019ll be close. Operator : And our next question comes from John Rogers of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. John Rogers : Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple of quick follow ups. Just back on the restructuring, Kevin. The $130 million to $160 million in cost savings that you are looking for, is that all in SG&A or effectively nearly all? Kevin Berryman : The majority of it is SG&A. there is some gross margin benefits of which we have not disclosed, but certainly the bulk of it is G&A related. John Rogers : Okay. And then, maybe \u2013 you guys talked about some of your end markets and gave us some updates there. I was wondering if you could talk about it geographically a little bit. Specifically Europe and Australia where you've had more acquisitions over the last couple of years. Kind of the progress there and what you are seeing in the market. Noel Watson : Well, why don\u2019t we do it like this? If you look at it geographically, you will know what's going on in Europe and then Europe continues to be slow grow. And the business there is doing reasonably well, but it is battling a lot of headwinds in Europe. The Middle East is still early bubbly even though I think somebody said it here earlier that the oil price is down in the Saudi continue to sell more oil anytime in history and they continue to expand on social programs. So the Middle East is strong. The U.S. outside \u2013 the oil and gas that is generally very strong. Australia is very solid in infrastructure and water business. The mining business in Australia is suffering as it is across the globe, although frankly, in the mining business we\u2019re doing better than thought we would. We\u2019ve really made this sustaining capital work even in Australia. And so, our downturn probably has not been as dramatic as you would have thought. So geographically, then you into Asia, where china is, our business in Singapore is still very strong. So as I look at clusters of geographically I\u2019ve got a real mix. And then I go to South America and we continue to be very solid and Chile. We probably doing better in Chile than any other contracts. Is that fair Andy? John Rogers : That\u2019s absolutely correct, Noel, thanks. Noel Watson : So, you know, and part of that is we\u2019ve been able to take that mining business in Chile, and we take it into the sustaining capital and we made it very successful. So we don\u2019t need a lot of new big cap projects to make our business in South America work well. And that\u2019s just a general geographic spread. John Rogers : And Noel, maybe just following up on that then, in terms of the restructuring efforts or the needs to reduce cost, is that predominantly Europe? Noel Watson : No, this is global. We are reducing cost everywhere it makes sense to reduce cost in the restructuring, taking us back to being very competitive. Because some of this \u2013 maybe a whole bunch of this goes to the bottom line. John Rogers : Okay. Great. Thank you. And Noel, enjoy your \u2013 more rest after August 17. Noel Watson : Don\u2019t worry. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Mecray from Tower Bridge Advisors. Please go ahead. Paul Mecray : Good morning. Given your very strong balance sheet and your positive free cash flow, and with Steve coming on as the new CEO, is it likely that the board might readdress its opposition to paying a dividend while preferring share repurchases? Kevin Berryman : This is mine, okay. Steve and I talked about this earlier in the week. I think when Steve gets on board and he gets totally up to speed, we will be looking at the capital structure. And certainly, we will take a look at share repurchase versus dividend, does it make any sense? What are we doing? I think that will be a subject for some time during 2016, that the board will thoroughly address. Paul Mecray : Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Okay. So I think probably at this point in time, we will cut it off. Not sure whether we have anyone else in the queue. But we have gone a bit over. And certainly, I will turn it back over to you Noel, for any final comments or clarity, points of clarity that you would like to make. Noel Watson : Okay, hey, thanks folks. It was a good session. The questions were good. We enjoy your interest. And we look forward to continue working relationship with you. Thanks a lot. Operator : And thank you, sir. Today\u2019s conference has now concluded. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Berryman, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Laura and good morning and good afternoon to all. We welcome everyone to Jacob\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings call. I will be joined on the call today by Steve Demetriou, our new President and CEO. And as you know, our earnings announcement was released this morning and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation to our website which we will reference in our prepared remarks. I would also like to remind everyone that Jacobs is hosting a webcast presentation to the financial community tomorrow beginning at 08 :00 AM Eastern Standard Time where management will discuss our fiscal year 2016 initiatives in more detail. Of course we invite you to join this event to hear more about the important changes that we are making in the company going forward. Before starting I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement which is summarized on Slide 2. I will provide our customary review of our forward-looking statement. The company requests that we point out that any statements that the company makes today that are not based on historical facts are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on management\u2019s current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of the company to differ materially from what may be inferred from the forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the factors, which may occur that could cause or contribute to such differences, the company requests that you read its most recent earnings release and its annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 02, 2015 including Item 1-A, risk factors, Item 3, legal proceedings and Item 7 management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations contained therein, for a description of our business, legal proceedings and other information that describes the factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I will now turn to the agenda for today which is shown on Slide 3. Steve will begin with a discussion on his first impressions since joining Jacobs three months ago, followed by his thoughts on our 2015 performance. I will then present the financial details for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal year 2015 including an update on our restructuring initiative, our share buyback program and our backlog. Steve will continue with the market update for each of the business sectors, provide his thoughts on our outlook for the 2016 fiscal year and also discuss the recent reorganization that we announced. He will then conclude with some closing thoughts before we open it up for some Q&A. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Steve. Steven Demetriou : All right, thank you Kevin. I'm now on Slide 4 and I want to welcome all of you to our 2015 fiscal year end and fourth quarter earnings call, my first since joining Jacobs. As Kevin mentioned, we will also be hosting our annual investor presentations in New York and Boston tomorrow and hope that many of you can join us. Kevin and I will be accompanied by the four lines of business Presidents; Terry Hagen, President of Aerospace & Technology; Andy Kremer, President of Industrial; Gary Mandel, President of Petroleum & Chemicals, and Phil Stassi, President of Buildings & Infrastructure. And all four of these gentlemen are here this morning to assist during the Q&A session. When offered this leadership position by the Board of Directors to become the next CEO of Jacobs, I knew I had an opportunity to join and lead a great company. What I've learned in my first few months have exceeded the expectations as it relates to both the strengths of Jacobs and the opportunities to improve and grow. For most of my first three months I travelled across the globe to meet numerous Jacobs' employees and customers across many of our market sectors. I have experienced the safety commitments that's best-in-class built off a Beyond Zero program that our customers value and which demonstrates a true culture of caring for and commitment to our employees. I\u2019m excited about the talent that exists at Jacobs and the superior engineering, construction and technical services capabilities. And our portfolio of customers and in markets served is among the best and most diverse in the industry, a huge strength that we need to do a better job of leveraging for growth and demonstrating the benefits to our shareholders. What has also been exciting to learn during my initial months of engaging with employees and customers are the numerous opportunities to improve and grow Jacobs. First it\u2019s clear the company impressively grew over the past several decades as a result of numerous organic and inorganic initiatives. While recently however, it has faced challenges to sustain that growth and it's now time to develop a new strategy that will better focus our employees, create value for our customers and benefit our shareholders. This new strategy will clearly be aimed at profitably growing Jacobs and to become a top quartile performer including in terms of shareholder return. While we develop the strategy over the next six months, we are implementing enhancements to the way we run our business. This includes a better focus on our global lines of businesses which provide opportunities for increased accountability and transparency, further optimization of our cost and working capital and an upgrade of our tools and processes to further strengthen the delivery of projects to our customers. With the arrival of Kevin as the new CFO at the beginning of this calendar year, with the CEO void being filled after a fairly long search and with the new lines of business structure now fully announced, there is a renewed energy and sense of urgency driving our Jacobs culture and business results across the globe. Turning to Slide 5, let's get down to business of presenting and discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter. We\u2019re pleased to report our fourth quarter earnings at $0.80 per share which is towards the higher end of our forecasted range. Including a one-time tax benefit, adjusted total fiscal year 2015 earnings came in at $3.08 per share down 7% versus fiscal year 2014. We continue to see adverse market conditions in multiple sectors, particularly in oil and mining commodity markets and these were major contributors to the year-over-year decline in both the fourth quarter and total fiscal year. We also faced competitive pricing pressures and cyclical economic patterns in certain key markets which negatively impacted our revenue mix and unit margins. However, I\u2019m impressed with how the Jacobs' leadership team worked quickly and effectively to implement the restructuring initiative earlier in the fiscal year as a counter action to right size our cost structure against lower industry demand and market pressure. Kevin will provide details of the successful restructuring benefits to ensure we meet or exceed previous targeted savings. I'm fully supportive and engaged in this initiative and working with our leadership team to identify and implement additional efficiencies in the face of very uncertain near term market conditions. Also helping in maintaining a fairly stable quarterly earnings performance across fiscal year 2015 were some positive dynamics in our pharma-bio, infrastructure, national government and specialty chemical sectors. Several major wins occurred in these businesses that helped to maintain our backlog and provide some offset to challenges we will continue to face on the commodity side of our business in 2016. These wins included in total contract values a near $1 billion project for a top global biotech company. An $800 million win for a significant international chemical facility expansion and $550 million U.S federal government support services contract. And given our positive cash flow performance, Jacobs continued to enhance shareholder value by completing the first $500 million share buyback program announced in 2014 in initiating a second $500 million buyback initiative during the most recent quarter which we plan to execute in a balanced approach over the next three years. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin to provide more detail on the quarter and the final 2015 fiscal year performance. Kevin Berryman : Thanks Steve. So let's split forward to Slide 7 where I will first discuss our financial performance for the 2015 fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.1 billion and earnings per share was $0.80 which was as Steve noted at the higher end of the guidance we provided at our Q3 earnings call and comfortable ahead of consensus. While we continue to see macroeconomic headwinds and continued commodity weakness that has impacted certain of our end markets this quarter, it is important to note that on a constant currency basis our revenues actually grew at a rate of 2%. That is benefiting from the previously disclosed additional week on our Q4 results in 2015. During a year of volatile end market dynamics the company was again able to leverage the strengths of its diversity and simultaneously manage costs resulting in one of the strongest underlying absolute levels of quarterly adjusted EPS performance during 2015 with our Q4 adjusted EPS coming in at $0.80 per share. Please also note that the quarter adjusted EPS figure also includes a negative foreign exchange impact of 4% from the year ago comparable figure. One of the key messages that we would like to convey to you this morning is to note that this year ended up being a year of stable results for the company. While certain of our end markets continued to face challenges, our diversity and cost reduction initiatives allowed us ultimately to deliver consistent results. In the first instance, our diverse portfolio and specifically the stronger elements associated with those less challenged end markets helped to mitigate some of the pressure on our revenues and gross margins associated with some of the more challenged markets. In the second instance our lower SG&A cost was supported by the increased benefits of our restructuring over the course of the year as evidenced by our continued reduction in our SG&A expenditures during the quarter. Finally, our continued strong cash flow during the year supported our aggressive execution of our share buyback program also supporting our adjusted EPS performance as compared to the comparable year ago period. So let's turn to Slide 8, where I'd like to highlight our performance for the fiscal year 2015. Total revenues were $12.1 billion and when adjusted for foreign exchange translation impacts versus the year ago figure was flat, again an indication of the stability of our performance this year. Adjusted net earnings were $411 million, representing an adjusted EPS of $3.26 for the year. While our adjusted EPS is reported at $3.26 please remember that the only difference between our reported GAAP and reported adjusted figures is the restructuring cost associated with our aggressive steps to streamline our cost structure. It is also important to remember that the $3.26 figure also includes the large discrete tax benefit item that we had in Q3 of $0.18 per share resulting in not showing the underlying adjusted EPS figure here noted on the slide of $3.08. Consistent with the Q4 results the stronger U.S. dollar impacted our results for the full year as well driving 3% of the reduction in our EPS for the year. While the ongoing headwind is already discussed influenced certain of our end markets. Jacobs diverse portfolio helped mitigate again the impact of some of these pressures. In addition, our positive efforts to reduce the cost and better align our operations with the current global environment supported the company's ability to deliver the adjusted operating profit figure of $600 million for the year. Savings on the restructuring built over the course of the year was nearly 30% of the original expected savings from the restructuring realized during 2015. The billing of the savings during the year was critical and was a primary driver to the company's ability to report relatively stable operating profit over the four quarters of the year. Cash flow also remained strong for the company with cash flow at year end debt at $365 million and $137 million respectively. Cash flow conversion versus our reported net earnings are close to 1 for the year. These figures remain strong even though the company remained aggressive in the execution of its share buyback program during Q4 and the full year. I will provide a brief update on our program later in the presentation. Not unexpectedly we continue to have ample reserves of cash and no debt thereby providing the company with substantial flexibility going forward. Importantly, our strong cash flow and balance sheet remained a hallmark at Jacobs. Turning to Slide 9, I also wanted to give you an update on the restructuring effort that was announced during the year in 2015. As already communicated in our prior earnings call, the focus of our restructuring has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to announce our overall cost effectiveness, especially given some of the market pressures. We believe our efforts will provide an ability for Jacobs to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are competing. As the restructuring has gained momentum, we are actually now forecasting one-time costs associated with this to be between $205 million to $230 million and importantly our annualized savings are now estimated in the range of $150 to $180 million on a full year basis. Consistent with our original intent the effort is focused on reducing our fixed cost infrastructure primarily our labor and real estate. The plan is now expected to reduce over 20% of our fixed overhead labor costs and is impacting nearly 15% of our real estate portfolio. As you also know, we recently announced a significant reorganization of the company into four global business lines. While the recent reorganization was not driven by our focus on cost savings we also believe the new organization will result in improved simplification focus and alignment all of which will result in ongoing further cost efficiencies. Finally, we also expect that much of our original efforts in restructuring will be largely completed by the end of our fiscal Q1 in 2016. But that certainly will not prevent us from continuing to drive for further cost efficiencies longer term. So let me turn to Slide 10 to discuss our ongoing return of capital to shareholders. The first component of this, the 2014 $500 million share buyback has now been completed. A total of $422 million were spent in fiscal year 2015 full year stock being the original authorization levels. As you'll recall, the Board also authorized a second buyback in July 2015. The second buyback component announced during our Q3 earnings call also totaled $500 million. Consistent with previous guidance and Steve's comments, we will be taking a more balanced approach to the second $500 million buyback authorization and our expectations are the first authorization will be utilized more evenly over a three-year term. We believe this initiative shows the confidence that our Board and the executive leadership have in Jacobs, its future, and the company's ability to generate continued long term sustainable cash flow resulting in our flexibility to support both growth and return of capital to our shareholders. Before turning it back to Steve, I'd like to turn to Slide 11 and make a few brief comments on our backlog. Our full backlog remains at $18.8 billion an increase of more than 2% year-over-year and flat versus our backlog that we supported at the end of our third quarter. You will note that the backlog for field services and technical professional services currently equals $11.7 billion and $7.1 billion respectively. Note that our professional services backlog has been impacted primarily by a heavy process in mining and minerals business and our strong field services backlog is being driven by our developing strike [ph] in our Pharma-Bio business. Our backlog at the end of the year again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity where certain of our stronger end markets have been able to offset some challenges than others. Importantly, the backlog level has been negative impacted by foreign exchange translation changes by nearly $200 million versus the Q3 figures and over $600 million versus the year ago backlog figure of $18.4 billion. Taking these figures into account, the backlog on a like-for-like basis has actually increased by $1 billion versus a year ago figure. Finally, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill currently sits at 1.04 slightly improved versus the last quarter results. With that, let me turn it over to Steve for some further discussions on our end markets and our outlook for 2016. Steven Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. I'm now on Slide 13. As we move into the 2016 outlook, I'd first like to update you on our end market diversity and give you a brief overview on how these markets are impacting Jacobs as we start the new fiscal year. As you know, we are one of the most diverse E & C companies and our cost reimbursable contracts continue to represent 83% of our revenues. As I referenced in my opening comments our revenue mix continues to evolve with total fiscal year 2015 oil and gas refining and chemicals represented approximately 43% of total revenues down from 48% in fiscal year 2014. But within that group of businesses, chemicals increased. Buildings and infrastructure grew from 17% to 21% of total revenues and national government grew from 18% to 22%, both being notable increases that offset the declines in upstream oil and gas and certain mining sectors. Starting with next quarter's earnings call, we'll discuss our end markets by the new four lines of global businesses consistent with our new organization structure. This new segmentation will be consistent with the way we'll prioritize and focus growth initiatives while also providing shareholders better clarity on the performance and benefits of our diverse portfolio. However, for today consistent with how we've previously discussed our markets, I'll now provide an update on how we see things trending in fiscal year 2016. This next slide starts with our processed segment which includes the Oil & Gas Refining and Chemical sectors. As we look to fiscal year 2016 the outlook continues to present a mixed bag. As you all know, the significant decline in oil prices has had a major impact on our customers' cash flows and capital spend, especially in the upstream side of the oil and gas sector. It has been reported that CapEx at the large integrated oil companies was down more than 20% in 2015 and there were reports of further CapEx spending declines in 2016. As a result this has negatively impacted our backlog and margins in this sector. However, we do believe we are near the bottom and demand will stabilize in this new fiscal year. We're specifically seen an impact in the Canadian oil sands market, however, our team is doing an excellent job in the region of refocusing on smaller sustaining capital and maintenance work and is increasing market share with our clients. And even in the face of low oil prices we're continuing to see investments in selective regions such as the Middle East and Africa where we're building upon our local presence. While our crude oil feedstock costs have had a positive impact on independent refiners margins and we're seeing a steady business in this part of the process segment with a strong backlog of sustaining capital in refinery upgrade projects. We are also seeing opportunities to help our customers in their product flexibility, operating efficiencies and compliance with safety environmental regulations. The strongest part of our process segment is in the chemicals sector. We are in the mix for several interesting growth prospects across the globe. In fact we were just informed of a major win with one of the largest petrochemical companies which we will provide further information about later in the first quarter. In summary, our process segment has faced significant headwinds, however, with our geographic and end market diversity, coupled with our sustaining services focus, and based on our strong track record of success we believe we are poised to start experiencing overall growth in the backend of fiscal 2016 in the process sector. So now on to slide 15. Our Industrial group is highlighted on the next slide which includes our pharma-bio, mining and minerals, specialty chemicals and manufacturing markets. In the pharma-bio space we're clearly experiencing a strong growth and our backlog has significant increased from a year ago. Increased M&A consolidations are occurring driving select opportunities for Jacobs to help clients with portfolio consolidation and optimization. Aging populations, emerging market expansion, technology advances are all driving a transformational growth cycle in the pharma sector. We have strengthened our leadership focus and multi office strategy to go after the strong growth potential and we're well positioned with our China and Southeast Asia presence in addition to our well established U.S. and Europe capability. In specialty chemicals and manufacturing we are facing solid market opportunities. This involves several smaller sectors including pulp and paper, consumer products and inorganic chemicals. Several of our pulp and paper clients are expanding offshore and we're leveraging our strong domestic position to follow these customers in their overseas expansions. We're increasing focus on consumer products globally. Also as part of our reorganization, we've put our global specialty chemical technologies under one leader to create synergies. This includes our Comprimo sulfur, Chemetics sulfuric acid and our phosphoric acid technologies. We believe this will enable Jacobs to participate more broadly in our customer projects by leveraging our specific strengths to help customers who benefit from our technologies. In addition to this, we're also seeing strong consultancy activity in power especially in Asia Pacific where we're looking to increase our market share. We do continue to face challenging times in mining and minerals. After slashing CapEx in 2015 our customers are expected to remain extremely cautious in their 2016 spend. We are partly mitigating this with market share growth and sustaining capital projects and are well position in our pursuit of the few large prospects of South America and the Far East. The bright spot in this segment is in our fertilizer activities where we have a strong position in Morocco and are developing opportunities across the globe. On the next Slide is our public and institutional group. Our national government business is picking up momentum and is positively positioned in 2016. While challenges exist with reductions in government spending and delayed award cycles, we're continuing to gain market shares to offset these dynamics and believe that the recent federal budget deal provides stability over the next few years. We are well positioned with our long-standing relationships such as NASA as well as for emerging opportunities and commercial advanced technical facility designs along with building operations work for aerospace, automotive and energy markets. The strategic investments over the past few years are starting to show benefits including the largest of those our accusations of FNS as part of our intelligence community and cyber security growth strategy. The well funded national security priorities are expected to provide growth for our Jacobs technology group. Our expansion investments have test and training range operations or maintenance especially for the U.S. army of providing good growth opportunities in this sector. Also we are experiencing positive trends in the nuclear sector associated with new builds primarily in the UK. Our infrastructure business is experiencing good growth opportunities across the globe led by our strong physician and transportation including highways rail and aviation. We are hoping the news associated with a potential U.S. Federal Highway Funding Bill will provide the stimulus to drive growth for Jacobs and we\u2019re well positioned in the UK and in Australia for several highway opportunities. The railway transit markets are fairly robust across the globe, particularly in high-speed rail. And in aviation, where we have a leading planning and asset management practice where we are positioned positively for many of the expansion initiatives especially across U.S., UK and the Middle East. Also positive for our infrastructure group is continued growth in environmental and water. We are also expecting steady growth opportunities in the building sector, specifically in aviation, education health care and mission critical end markets. Leveraging off of our infrastructure relationships, we\u2019re seeing increased activity in the buildings component of aviation. In the UK and certain U.S. reasons we're also seeing a trend to upgrade educational facilities and we're pursuing numerous opportunities across the globe and health care. In Australia we are well positioned for the potential education city project of Melbourne which have funded quick present [ph] Jacobs with a significant role over a long period of time. Mission critical should continue to be a high growth opportunity where for example we have a strong position with one of the largest cloud store donors in this business. Although we are experienced in positive trends across our public and institutional businesses with a slowdown in the industrial markets we\u2019re seeing some margin pressure as competition on the refocuses on this growth sector. On Slide 17 I would like to briefly discuss the recent reorganization of Jacobs which represents the first step in our transformation. In discussing some of my initial impressions of Jacobs earlier I\u2019ve mentioned several enhancements to improve our company. To meet the improvement goals we announce the realignment of our leadership structure around four global lines of business. One of the important changes is the integration of the sales organization into these global lines of businesses to more deeply embed and strengthen the partnership between winning business and delivering the projects. To ensure consistent support for the new business structure the four lines of businesses will be strengthened by newly established global centers of excellence for sales and for project delivery, which will focus on standardizing and optimizing our processes, tools and systems to ensure we have the highest global capabilities across Jacobs. I would also like to note that the reorganization provides the opportunity to further lean out our overhead structure and drive further cost savings. We believe that this significant change in leadership focus on accountability will be a key driver in profitably transforming Jacobs and it will be integral to outperforming the market over the longer term and will provide greater clarity to our customers and shareholders. I am confident that the improved business line structure and cost reduction initiatives will preserve the best of the past and better position us to enhance our already strong competitive position. Ultimately greater accountability, efficiency, focus, simplicity, and transparency will drive stronger, more profitable long term growth. So turning to Slide 18, when we report altogether for fiscal year 2016 we believe we will continue to face a very challenging global environment with uncertainty and limited visibility in several of our markets. It is clear that in petroleum and mining and general industrial commodity markets our clients are waiting to decide when and how to spend their cash. We do believe that the clients in some of these end markets have either hit or are close to bottom. On the flip side, we believe that our buildings, infrastructure, pharma and federal work will provide growth opportunities in 2016, thus balancing and demonstrating the strength of our diversity which provides the ability to deliver stable earnings in uneven market conditions. We expect fiscal year first quarter to be our most challenging quarter of the year with EPS below last year\u2019s first quarter, but a more stable situation to then develop as we move further into 2016. For total fiscal year of 2016 we're providing initial guidance between $20.80 and $3.30 for adjusted EPS which we believe to be a prudent view given the current uncertain global environment. In response to this uncertainty we will continue to take every step possible to drive further cost efficiencies that leaned out our overhead structure without impacting our ability to win new business. We will be disciplined to ensure we capture the full year remaining incremental 2016 savings associated with our 2015 restructuring initiative. And although our recently announced reorganization was about strengthening our leadership culture, providing much needed focus and accountability, we expect it will also yield additional cost savings as we move through fiscal year 2016. In addition, we will continue to evaluate our office footprint and procurement processes to seek further cost savings opportunities. There is a clear energy building across Jacobs and with our customers, with the senior leadership now clarified and the reorganization fully executed there is a new culture of intense focus, higher accountability and excitement building across the company. The majority of our heavy lifting associated with the restructuring has been executed and although there will be additional cost initiatives, our focus is now pivoting toward flawlessly executing projects of our customers and profitably growing the company. So now, to slide 19. To summarize 2015 fiscal year post a different environment and the company took few steps to proactively mitigate the challenges. Looking to fiscal year 16, we expect continued uncertainty and an uneven economic environment to persist. We currently expect fiscal 2016 results to be softer in the first half, but the second half to be stronger as cost savings benefits are realized and market conditions begin to improve. The new business structure that we implemented at Jacobs simplifies with the company globally and will ensure a stronger leadership team is in place to focus on our long term strategic objectives. To further support this greater clarity on strategic growth is needed and a deep dive strategic review is underway. We will provide some additional comments on this in our investor presentation tomorrow morning and discuss our thoughts on how we will drive strategy. We believe the initiatives we have undertaken and those we continued to implement here at Jacobs are aligning with shareholders interest and will ensure we are well positioned to drive long term profitable growth. Thank you for listening and we\u2019ll now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m wondering if you folks can talk about the range of your expectations embedded within your guidance for revenue burn and margins, Kevin, if you could just frame that for us? And maybe secondly, there are number of moving pieces between the cost reduction efforts on one hand and the pricing pressure that you cited in the prepared remarks, can you flush out for us how we should be thinking about gross margins and SG&A to sales on a run rate basis post the restructuring? Kevin Berryman : Thanks for the question Jerry and good morning to you as well. Look, I think, we won\u2019t go into a lot of details here, but I will tell you clearly that our efforts on the restructuring and resulting in what we believe will be some fundamental changes and our SG&A cost going forward. By default if we're successful in doing that which obviously we are assuming and we are telling you we feel good about that that implies given our guidance that there is some pressure on our gross margin. And I think that clearly the dynamics as it relates to certain of the end markets that are under pressure or those places we see at most and so effectively at the end of the day, the guidance would suggest that we\u2019re able to maintain our kind of EPS levels given the fact that we\u2019re able to reduce our SG&A which offsets some of the gross margin pressure. Jerry Revich : Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up on the chemicals business, your business picked up well ahead of your peers and has been good growth driver over the past couple of years, it obviously slowed this year, can you talk about how much visibility you have on that picking up in the back half of fiscal 2016 as I think the prepared remarks describe, is it the timing of a couple of major projects or can you just give us some more color on what you\u2019re seeing in that end market? Kevin Berryman : Yes, why don\u2019t we ask Gary Mandel to answer that question? Gary Mandel : Yes, our pipeline of chemical prospects is probably more robust than we\u2019ve seen in several years; through Q4 and through November of this year we've picked up some wins, some of which we can announce, some Steve mentioned we\u2019ll announce in Q1. We see a lot more opportunities and we\u2019re able to leverage with the new line of business structure those opportunities globally. So there is a lot more communication and focus on that since we have a single Head of chemicals globally. And so we feel some of those are in the pre-feed feed stage, but we will convert in the second half of the year and that\u2019s why we told you we believe the second half will be more robust. Jerry Revich : Great, thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher : Great, thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the chemicals question first. Just thinking back to 2013, 2014, you had a number of chemicals prospects as well and some came through, but others lost to or lost to competition. So I guess, I\u2019m curious how you think things might be different this time around and how the confidence you have that that business will actually start picking back up in the second half of the year? Thanks. Gary Mandel : Yes, this is Gary again. Yes, there was a lot of competing projects a couple of years ago and if you remember we had some project cancellations as well. We\u2019re seeing a different environment here. There is more pure play chemical companies that are pursuing these projects with the low feedstock and the pricing improvement and supply chain we see them going forward. Our estimates are matching the customers' estimates. We believe they will get sanctioned and move forward. Especially looking at the U.S., the Middle East and Asia, we see a lot more projects in those three areas and the dynamics are such that we believe they will move forward. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then just a question on the guidance, I mean can you just give us a sense for the overall direction of revenues in fiscal 2016? And then perhaps the cadence and I\u2019m assuming is going to be negative in the first half of the year, year-over-year and then pick up positive? And maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the mix how that might be different 2016 versus 2015 and how that specifically might be playing into your margin trajectory? Kevin Berryman : So Steve, then let me take that, this is Kevin. So a couple of things, I think what we would suggest is, certainly at the gross margin line there is going to be some pressure that would imply that there will be some pressure on the top line. But as you know, we focus more on the gross margin because of the pass-through dynamics and what not relative to how that flows through revenues. But certainly there will be downward pressure on revenues as well and I would suggest to you in the first part of the year, we\u2019re still comparing to the first part of 2014 which was still on a downward trajectory as it relates to some of the businesses. So yes, the pressure will be larger in the first half of the year. To the point that Gary has been alluding to and responding to the first few questions, certainly there are differences in mix that we\u2019ll be developing longer term over the course of the year and certainly we\u2019re expecting that chemicals will be stronger. We also believe that some of the other businesses will be more stable and have upward trends as well, but that will offset some of the continued challenges that we think we will have certainly in the first part of the year in mining and minerals. And remember, we\u2019re still comparing to our mining and minerals number in the first quarter a year ago that was still on a downward trajectory. So yes, there is some mixed dynamics going on, but all in all, I would suggest that there is going to be some pressure on gross margins and on the revenue side and probably largest in the first quarter, first half of the year. Steven Fisher : But how about on the field services versus professional services is that - obviously your backlog in field services picked up, is that going to be associated with some margin pressure as well? Kevin Berryman : Well, the good news is that some of the field service work is in the pharma-bio space which is generally a little bit better in terms of the field service margin, but yes there will be some impact there as well. Steven Fisher : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : And the next question is from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Tahira Afzal : Good morning, folks. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Tahira Afzal : You know if I look at the biotech and pharma side, clearly there is a lot of momentum there. I would love to get an idea if you\u2019re seeing any competitive pressures there, it is one of the market that I think there seems to be sustainable momentum and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing some of your more - we have a pretty strong position there, but would love to get a sense competitively how that is holding out? Steven Demetriou : Yes, this is Steve here. You\u2019re right, it is I\u2019d say on the top end of the exciting and growth markets that we\u2019re experiencing right now and as a result I would say it\u2019s the least of our concerns from a margin standpoint and more, we\u2019re more focused on how we properly resource and make sure we capitalize and capture all the growth that is in front of us. Tahira Afzal : Got it, okay. And from the incremental savings you\u2019re generating Kevin, most of those sort of being pass through to investors, how should we think about the visibility of those on the margin line? Kevin Berryman : As we\u2019ve communicated in the past Tahira, we will give you a perspective of what the savings are. We also have said to you that not all of those savings are going to actually be seen on the P&L, but we will reinvest some of it back into our business, certainly some of our investments in our people, in our systems or some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about will be required to be done. But we will provide that clarity as we work through the course of the year to give you a little bit better sense. The good news is, is that the savings are coming through and it provides us the flexibility to do some of those things that we need to do and at the same time offset some of the pressure points that we\u2019ve talked about. Tahira Afzal : Got it, thank you folks. Operator : And next we have a question from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Nice quarter. Kevin Berryman : Thank you. Andrew Kaplowitz : Kevin, can you talk about Jacobs' backlog as we go through 2016? You actually maintained sequential backlog on the strength of the pharma-bio stuff that you talked about in 4Q, given an increased currency headwind, so when you look at 2016 can you maintain or grow backlog on the strength of the industrial or government or pharma-bio portfolio or maybe the downstream that you talked about trying to improve? Kevin Berryman : Let me start off and just give you my perspective of the backlog. When you look at our backlog or I analyzed our backlog over the course of the last year, it\u2019s basically in the flattish side up slightly and the major story is a significant reduction in our backlog on upstream, on the petroleum side and a significant increase in the specialty industrial side of our business led by the pharma-bio. And in between all that, I would say is a good solid performance of backlog from the rest of our business including some of the refining and chemicals side of our process, building and infrastructure, solid performance in our technology, aerospace and technology group showing good strength. The mining decline actually had occurred starting a year ago. So when you look at our backlog it\u2019s not that heavily impacted because we felt the lot of that deterioration in the past. And so, right now it\u2019s all about winning new business and I think we gave you a flavor in our opening remarks there is lot of energy, excitement around all four of these sectors that we\u2019re focusing on. And yes, we do believe that we have excellent prospects to continue to strengthen our backlog over the near term. So that is my perspective of the backlog. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, Steve so could you give a fresh advice as you look at the company, you guys have honestly talked about restructuring, you\u2019ve upped your cost and benefits there, but the Jacobs have been a company over a long period of time there has been a lot of acquisitions with arguably some people think not as much integration as may be union to take place, so when you step back and look at the business and you talk about the strategic review that you guys are doing, is that one of the areas where you could take significant cost out over the next year or just sort of consolidating internally and moving forward how do you look at that? Steven Demetriou : It\u2019s a good question and my personally \u2013 much I have been doing a lot of digging into the acquisitions and since the beginning of the company there has been approximately 70 acquisitions over the course of the many decades and that\u2019s been a lot of work is makes up Jacobs today. And when you look at the most recent acquisitions they were among our largest and I do believe that there is still meat on the bone with regard to driving efficiencies and synergies. The company was very focused on aggressive growth. Frankly, as we all, the leadership team looked back at the acquisitions we feel like they were excellent strategic acquisitions, and but we could probably have done better on the integration side and driving the full benefits of cost synergies. And so the good news is some of that is still there and were focused on those and as part of our strategic review will be if and when as when we get back into the acquisition initiatives to have a much more robust best-in-class integration process in the company. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s it. Kevin just one clarification, the $100 million in restructuring costs you had in the quarter is that all in SG&A or the vast majority could you give us that number of that $100 million is it all SG&A? Kevin Berryman : Yes, just think of it basically as SG&A. It's almost entirely SG&A. There is a piece that probably goes up in the gross margin, but for your modeling purposes is not worth talking about. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great, thanks guys. Operator : And the next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research. Brian Konigsberg : Yes, hi good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Brian Konigsberg : Steve, maybe I just wanted to push a little bit more on the commentary around just the oil and gas spending you noted, do you think that we are near a bottom, when you make those comments are you kind of aggregating what you\u2019re seeing in chemical with oil and gas or are there things, downstream that may be still offsetting upstream that might be coming down, may be give me at little more clarity on what you see your confidence you are seeing a bottom and are there kind of offsetting components to that aggregate number you are talking about? Steven Demetriou : Yes, that\u2019s a good question and my comments on hitting the bottom and stabilizing is more from a Jacobs position in that industry and what gives me confidence that we are near bottom of and should see stable profile and in fact may be some momentum by the second half is that most of our activity is focused on refining and chemicals. In the upstream we\u2019ve got a good position on sustaining capital and maintenance and most of the major project work that\u2019s behind us and so when we look at our backlog and we look at the initiatives that are in front of us what gives me confidence is the fact is that we're well positioned in that refining and chemicals sector. We all recognized that there is a lot of uncertainty on oil prices and there is reports that things could get worse before they get better, but as we look at our mix of businesses and prospects we feel like we can operate through that uncertainty pretty successfully. Brian Konigsberg : Got it and secondly, you also made a comment about just working capital and thoughts on potential opportunities on that front. You are a little bit asset heavy relative to your peers from a working capital perspective, may be can you talk about what components you think you might be able to make progress on? And just in this type of environment how realistic is it to kind of push on the customer base to allow for a better working capital dynamics? Steven Demetriou : Yes, Brian I\u2019ll start and let Kevin build on this, but again as I come into the company and look at what we have been focused on working capital was not at the top of the list over the last couple of years compared to some of the other key initiatives that the leadership was focused on and we were now brought that to the forefront and have put that as one of our key objectives and driving working capital improvement and really the specific component is accounts receivables. And we analyze our working capital even in this difficult environment where customers are looking to stretch, et cetera, we believe there is significant improvement opportunities over the near term and so we expect to see that be a very successful trend in 2016. Brian Konigsberg : Thank you. Operator : Next we have a question from Michael Dudas of Sterne Agee. Michael Dudas : Good morning everyone. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Michael Dudas : My question is for you Steve, the first question is, I looked on Slide 17 about the transformation and how you set up the company with division and then structure, can you just say how you look at incentivizing the management teams and structures? Are you looking at return on capital targets? Obviously safety is going to be very important, but are the earnings, margins, how they\u2019re being viewed by success and how that\u2019s on a bottoms up basis translate to some of the bottom line growth that you\u2019re anticipating for the company over the next three or five years? Steven Demetriou : Okay. Thanks Mike for that question and again that is really a key question and something we\u2019ve focused heavily on over the last couple of months and so when you look at Slide 17 and you see that organization led by the four business lines, one of the first key changes is that these four Presidents have P&L, balance sheet, accountability at a much more focused transparent way than we've had in the past in the company and that cascades down through their leadership teams and the organizations. And so as we look at how we\u2019re setting up the incentives and goals for management, the short term manual incentive is going to be focused on operating profit and working capital and it will be focused where these leaders will have a component that is total company and a component that is based on their lines of business and both the terms of operating profit and working capital. And as we look at our long range incentive around equity, that current program is going to be tied to EPS and it\u2019s going to be tied to shareholder return relative to how the market is trending. That\u2019s the first phase of what we\u2019ve done in implementing and I think maybe major enhancement to incentive and accountability over the near term. Once we complete the strategy work by mid-year, other than strategic plan will most likely focus on potentially an additional metric or two that we need to be accountable for and that\u2019s where potentially a return component could be introduced to one of our team focal points and metrics that are going to drive the company and we will see what comes out of that strategy. Michael Dudas : My follow-up would be, as you look the first three months at the organization and in your strategic review, how do you view the risk tolerance and the risk profile of Jacobs' current book of business, and how you think it should be going forward, as the investment community and marketplace looks at a lot of cost plus, risk profile quite low. Is that something that's a core concept? Is that something that might adjust, given what's happening in the marketplace in some of your key growth driving in the market going forward? Steven Demetriou : One of the strengths of Jacobs over the years has clearly been our reimbursable, large reimbursable portion of our portfolio. And as I talk about preserving some of the cash that is clearly one of the things that we want to continue to be viewed by our shareholders and continue to have a smart intelligent risk profile. But I used that word intelligent risk is that as we reassess things in my first three months, we may have been overly conservative on some opportunities that we\u2019re clearly capable of executing and still maintaining a very prudent risk profile. So I expect in the outcome of our strategy work by mid-year that we\u2019re going to identify some additional opportunities that aren\u2019t currently in our mix, but will still be viewed by our shareholders and our board as being prudent risk opportunities. Michael Dudas : That's it, look forward to seeing you today, thanks. Steven Demetriou : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Anna Kaminskaya of Bank of America. Anna Kaminskaya : Good morning guys. I guess this is a follow-up on the previous question, but I wanted to get more color on your announcement having dedicated field service units in the U.S., is this more to drive more synergies or cost savings \u2013 or hello, can you hear me? Steven Demetriou : We\u2019re hearing. Anna Kaminskaya : Are you looking to grow it as a standalone business where you may be do move work as a direct high construction business, but larger construction project, I'd appreciate any more color that? Steven Demetriou : Yes, I\u2019m going to start with just a quick introduction and turn it over to Gary Mandel to talk about that, that's a lot of this starts on the process side, but cuts across the entire company. There is, I hate to say this because a lot of people think you can only do one versus the other, but this is one where we clearly see first and foremost growth. It is driven by growth, but also offers us the opportunity to drive some synergies by putting it all under one leader. So, let me turn it over to Gary to enhance that. Gary Mandel : Thank you, Steve. Yes, it is a growth strategy as evidenced by our increasing fuel service component that Kevin talked about that. As many of you have been tracking us for a number of quarters, we had a lot of projects in prefeeding fee that are now going to the execute base where we will be delivering the construction. But it is also a strategy we talked about the headwinds in our upstream all markets including the Canadian oil sands. One of the primary drivers for us in Canada right now is sustaining services and maintenance and so it was an opportunity to put this under one leader, to synergize the resources, to take care of our sustaining services and maintenance, but also grow the construction element as we\u2019re starting to see the projects get into the execute base. Anna Kaminskaya : So would that business be also doing construction part of the projects where you were not involved from the feed side of the business? Kevin Berryman : We actually have several of those opportunities under contract today and are pursuing others as well. Anna Kaminskaya : Great, and just a quick follow up on your cash flow redeployment. I think you said you would be more measured on buybacks. So does it mean you have a higher appetite for acquisitions over the next year, and if you do, where would you be focusing on? And then I guess going back to Steve on just the M&A process, besides the integration post M&A, do you envision any changes to how you source the deals or do due diligence, you do a separate kind of corporate development team to focus on M&A? Any color on that would also be appreciated. Steven Demetriou : Yes, so I\u2019m going to continue to come back to the - I think we\u2019re going to be in a much better position to explain all of this over the course of the next six months as we complete our strategy because I think you would want that to be strategically driven versus some initial opinions. But I will say that it's clear as I've coming into the company in the first three months that as we get into M&A in the future that we will want to do two things, we will want to have a very robust internal M&A capability with clearly the business is identifying the opportunities, but have a robust and experienced internal execution M&A team that takes those great ides of coming from the businesses and drive those and I think that will be an enhancement potentially from the way we've done in the past. But then marrying that is that we are going to want to haven an improved integration process in the company. And the good news about all this is, all of us have a lot of experience in this and so this is something we know and will be able to implement. And so the most important thing is let this be strategically driven coming out of our strategic plan and at that point we will have more to talk about. Anna Kaminskaya : And what about the just M&A appetite or is it similar that we would have to wait couple months? Steven Demetriou : Yes, again M&A will first of all need to be part of our long term, part of our long term portfolio of growth initiatives to complement our organic and so when will that occur we don\u2019t know yet today. I mean we - there are some very small initiatives that we\u2019re looking on. I think we feel comfortable that if we made some very small bolt-on initiatives that those could be easily absorbed by our company, but as far as anything that\u2019s material that will come out of our strategic plan. Anna Kaminskaya : Okay and just a clarification, how much of buyback is in your 2015 outlook if any? Kevin Berryman : Well, Anna this is Kevin. Look as we suggested, we will be measured and kind of ratably spend against our $500 million over the three-year term. Anna Kaminskaya : Okay, but it does include some assumption for buyback? Kevin Berryman : Yes, it does. Anna Kaminskaya : Thank you. Look forward to seeing you tonight. Steven Demetriou : Right, thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan. Jeff Volshteyn : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Continuing on the subject of alignment, so they were senior leaders in place, how much work would you say is there a less to building out mid level management teams under the new structure? In other words, the centers of excellence that you've identified and other key functions have they been already built out or it is still an ongoing process? Steven Demetriou : Yes, as far as the reorganization has been completely announced and people in the company know where they fit. So I would say that we\u2019re 90% complete and the reason why I say 90% is because we have identified that in a few areas we\u2019re going to want to bring in some additional capabilities to enhance this reorganization. And you just, you talked about centers of excellence. The leaders have been announced, their teams are in place, but when it comes to sales center of excellence and project delivery we potentially are going to add some capabilities within those organizations to make sure we could drive the best-in-class. But for the most part we\u2019re now completed in our reorganization and everyone is focused on executing projects of winning business. Jeff Volshteyn : Great, very helpful and then a question on power markets particularly in Asia-Pacific, can you comment on what type of projects are they sizable and given your kind of overall backlog and then may be a bit of color on nuclear and I know it is in a different segment, but any kind of nuclear projects that you are working on? Steven Demetriou : Okay, Andy Kremer is going to take that question. Andy Kremer : Yes, thanks Jeff. So in the Asia markets specifically our role is primarily working on the owner advisory side consulting, trying conceptual work. So it doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on backlog because this is a professional technical services market for us. We\u2019re not into new build construction in Asia, although the level of activity there is certainly driving a lot of professional, technical services. I\u2019ll turn it to Phil to talk about the Nuclear new build. Phil Stassi : So we have, this is Phil Stassi good morning. The nuclear new build programs particularly in the UK are robust. We are heavily involved in all of the major programs that are taking place there primarily in the civil structural side of this, but certainly in the planning and the support areas those projects and we\u2019ve been involved in those for the past year and a half or so. And in addition regarding power, general power, geothermal and hydroelectric is also an area of expertise that came out of the SKM organization and that is not only in South America, but also in Southeast Asia. So the big projects are in the UK and the nuclear new build and the other project as Andy stated is more in the consulting side. Jeff Volshteyn : Perfect, that's helpful. Kevin one last sort of a housekeeping question, can you share some of the assumptions for foreign exchange maybe tax rate and share count for the first quarter and perhaps throughout 2016? Kevin Berryman : I won\u2019t probably give you as much as you want Jeff, but let me give you some comments. I have told you collectively that I think we can do a better job in terms of driving an ETR that is lower than it has been historically. I think that that continues to be the case. You might recall that we had a 32.5% kind of number in 2014. We are well below that in 2015. I don\u2019t necessarily believe we\u2019ll get to the same level of 2014 and our - 2015 numbers and 2016, but they will be below our 2014 figures absolutely. So I think there is a continuation of our efforts to drive down our effective tax rates over time. We have some tax planning initiatives in place and we believe that some of those will come to fruition maybe even in the first quarter, but that\u2019s too premature to talk about at this particular point in time. But the ultimate message to you that we believe we can effectively drive down that rate longer term certainly from those 32.5% numbers that we saw in 2014. Jeff Volshteyn : And your assumptions for foreign exchange? Kevin Berryman : Look we are not assuming fundamental talking about the FX being a fundamental change from where it is today. So look, I think we\u2019re envisioning foreign exchange to be some challenges perhaps in Canada, a little bit of challenges versus Australia and UK and Euro versus the year ago figures, but not materially different from where the rates are today. Jeff Volshteyn : Thank you very much, very helpful. Operator : And this will conclude the question-and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Steven Demetriou : Okay. Thank you for being on the call today. I look forward to spending time with all of you in the future and seeing some of you over the next day. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day and welcome to the Jacobs first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Berryman, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning and afternoon to all and thank you, Austin, for the introduction. We welcome everyone to Jacobs' 2016 first quarter earnings call. I will be joined on the call today by Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO. As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we'll be posting a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks. Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on slide two. Any statements that we made today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain. And you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. There are variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, extracted, or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including: Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; as well as our other filings with Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. So let's get into the call officially. Let's turn to slide three for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with a highlight of our first quarter, followed by an update on the business and recent key initiatives. He will also provide some commentary on end market conditions for our four lines of business as well as highlights of recent high-profile project awards. I'll then provide a more in depth discussion on our financial metrics, including our backlog and current restructuring efforts. I will continue with some comments on our revenue to operating profit split and some comments on capital allocation. Steve will then finish by highlighting certain initiatives we are undertaking in our project delivery and sales centers of excellence, and we will then conclude with some closing comments. Finally, we'll open it up for some questions. With that, let me pass it over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO. Steve? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 first quarter earnings call. On slide four, before I summarize the numbers, I want to mention how I continue to be impressed with our Jacobs Beyond Zero commitment. I'm extremely pleased that our first quarter safety performance continued to trend positively. Not only is this important from a standpoint of culture of caring for our employees, but it's equally appreciated by our customers, who similarly prioritize safety excellence. So now on to our first quarter business performance; and as we previously projected in last quarter's earnings call, we faced a challenging global economic environment at the start of our fiscal year. Adverse market conditions, particularly in oil and mining, continue to have a significant impact on our businesses. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, growth markets such as Aerospace & Technology and PharmaBio helped us mitigate some of the pressures from our more challenged sectors. Our revenue for the quarter was $2.85 billion, and our backlog at quarter end as down 3% versus last quarter at $18.2 billion, what I consider to be a solid performance within the context of current market conditions. I'm very pleased with how the global Jacobs organization has proactively responded to the challenging global market conditions in terms of right-sizing our cost structure and focusing on project delivery excellence. The previously announced companywide restructuring initiative helped reduce first quarter G&A costs by 13% versus last year, and project execution performance trended in the right direction. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, including an approximate $0.09 per share discrete tax benefit, in line with expectations. Our balance sheet remains strong and should further strengthen as our heightened focus on working capital starts to take hold over the next several quarters. Turning to slide five, I'd like to comment on several of our key improvement initiatives. In the first quarter, we continued to successfully implement both the cost restructuring and organizational realignment that were launched last fiscal year. With regard to the restructuring, we continue to identify additional cost reductions and believe we have opportunities to further streamline and achieve more efficiencies as we progress through this year. As it relates to the new line of business organization, I'm very pleased with the quality and speed of implementation by the Jacobs leadership team and the excitement and buy-in of all our employees across the globe. We've been progressing on a number of companywide priorities, including strengthening of leadership accountability, improving project delivery, and launching a strategic review of Jacobs. However, most importantly, a top priority is getting back to winning business and growing the company. With regard to the strategy efforts, we're conducting an economic review of our entire portfolio. While this will feed into the next phase of the strategic plan development, we will immediately utilize the facts and insight to set near-term profit improvement goals for the company and each line of business. The strategic plan initiative we ultimately develop will be focused on how to profitably grow Jacobs. We will present this at an Analyst Day in the fourth quarter. And before turning to the next slide, I'd like to mention that beginning with next quarter's results, we'll report our segments consistent and aligned with our new lines of business. During our Investor Day last quarter, we presented backlog for the new structure on a preliminary basis. As we implement the companywide realignment across more than 60,000 employees in more than 30 countries, we're updating our financial systems to align with the new lines of business. With that, I'll now turn to slide six and provide a more in-depth discussion on each of our four business lines. I'll begin with our Petroleum & Chemicals business. Backlog for the group currently stands at $6.2 billion, which is marginally lower than last quarter, due mainly to the severe downturn on the upstream petroleum side of the business. As you all know, this line of business continues to face very challenging global market conditions. The significant decline in oil prices has had a major impact on many of our customers' cash flows and capital spend, especially on the upstream side of the oil and gas market. For example, our recent Wood Mackenzie report indicated that nearly $400 billion in global spend on new oil and gas projects has been shelved since the crude price collapse. In addition, the amount of deferred capital in this industry has increased from $200 billion to $380 billion since June. Two years ago, very few would have imagined $30 crude oil today, and there's a lot of uncertainty in the oil and gas markets. With crude inventories at record highs, the Iranian sanctions removed, the supply/demand imbalance is widening, and we are preparing for the overhang to continue. We've been able to partially mitigate these severe headwinds as a result of our industry-leading position in the resilient Middle East market as well as a strong focus on sustaining capital and maintenance across the oil and gas sector. The Refining segment remains solid for Jacobs. The U.S. market is being supported by exports, and lower fuel costs are encouraging demand. New emissions rules in the U.S. are increasing investment in alkylation capacity, which is an area of strength for Jacobs. Refining demand in developing countries is also expected to increase more than 3%. And our Europe projects are continuing to be driven by regulatory, environmental, and process safety opportunities. We're also seeing our clients diversify into value-added specialty products while also focusing on energy efficiency and yield improvement of existing assets. However, most of the major integrated petrochemical companies have announced staffing and budget cuts, impacting our demand with these clients. All in all, we remain steady in the petrochemical sector. And in this Petroleum & Chemicals business line, I'm very pleased with some of the major recent wins, including a very significant EPCM global partnership agreement with BASF, an EPCM service contract with Nippon Shokubai for a superabsorbent polymer plant in Belgium, and an EPCM services agreement for one of the world's largest oil companies. So now turning to slide seven, and before discussing our Industrial business, I'd like to recap this week's announcements regarding a change on our leadership team. I have asked Andy Kremer, President of our Industrial Group, to move into a new executive advisor role to provide leadership on several priority initiatives, continuing to report to me. Robert Pragada, who was previously an executive at Jacobs and more recently CEO of The Brock Group, a leading specialty trade contractor, started this week as the new President of our Industrial line of business. To capitalize on Bob's strong experience in construction, he'll also lead our field services units in North America and the UK. I'm excited to welcome Bob back to Jacobs. While at Jacobs from 2006 to 2014, Bob was highly respected by our employees and customers as a strong leader with an impressive track record in sales and operations. Our Industrial group's backlog is at $2.4 billion, down slightly from last quarter. The Industrial line of business includes life sciences, specialty chemicals and manufacturing, and mining and minerals. I do want to mention the backlog presented does not yet include the incremental field services that Bob Pragada will be responsible for and will shift over to his business line when we report results next quarter. Personally, our life sciences group is delivering exciting growth, as evidenced by major project awards throughout the past year from Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Genzyme. As a leading EPCM in commissioning, qualification, and validation project delivery firm in BioPharma, we are well positioned to profitably grow in this sector. Our footprint, resource base, and technical expertise span multiple geographies, including the high-growth Europe and Asia regions. Our objective is to remain the employer and supplier of choice, expand our industry-leading service offerings, and to continue to support our clients' investments into exciting new products. Meanwhile, we're seeing steady demand in specialty chemicals and manufacturing, with signs of improvement in several areas. This business unit includes pulp and paper, consumer products, and inorganic chemicals. Domestic demand for pulp and paper remains flat, but we are expanding internationally. Consumer goods is a relatively untapped opportunity for Jacobs. We're building key client alliances to selectively grow in this market. We're also seeing improving market conditions for our Comprimo Sulfur business that's being driven by recent environmental legislation in several countries. The fertilizer market continues to attract investment, driving new opportunities for our chemetics and phosphate technology businesses. Our Mining & Minerals group continues to be impacted by weak commodity prices. Major spending has been severely curtailed in response to the weak metal price environment and current oversupply. The supply/demand imbalance will correct over time, but we're not planning for a recovery in 2016. We continue to partly mitigate this by increasing our focus on sustaining capital projects and maintenance. I'm also impressed with our team's performance, as we are winning more than our fair share of the few large metals mining projects in South America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Also a positive for Jacobs is the ongoing investment in fertilizer projects, particularly phosphate mines and related chemical plants, especially in Africa, North America, and the Middle East. In the Industrial business line, we were recently awarded an EPCM contract from Biogen for a new state-of-the-art facility in Switzerland. This came on the back of other major awards for our Life Sciences group. Noteworthy, we recently won a sustaining capital projects contract with Alcoa of Australia. So now turning to slide eight, our Buildings & Infrastructure backlog remained steady at $4.7 billion. This line of business for Jacobs is quite diverse and spans a variety of markets, including healthcare, education, aviation, water, rail, highways, and power. On the Buildings side, we continue to see growth in the U.S. and UK at the state and regional level. In education, K-through-12 projects in high growth cities are a particularly bright spot. The Affordable Care Act is also continuing to impact the U.S. healthcare industry, and higher use of clinic and outpatient telemedicine facilities is driving a step change in the market. We're on the forefront of this trend and are helping our clients adapt through the use of advanced planning and modular techniques. Mission-critical markets are also a positive and continue to grow and develop globally. In the commercial building industry, we're continuing to focus on several key customer relationships, where we are leveraging our oil and gas, chemical, and PharmaBio expertise to expand our offerings and cross-company synergies. One example of this is our ongoing involvement with one of our major integrated petroleum clients on several of their offices and building projects globally. Meanwhile, we're seeing positive global growth in our Infrastructure business, particularly in aviation, highways, and rail. Australian and Asian transportation sectors are noteworthy growth spots, driven by population growth and economic stimulus. Rail is certainly growing, and we're seeing a mixture of high-speed rail as well as passenger and Class 1 freight being developed in multiple regions. We are well positioned in the U.S. for upcoming ballot initiatives to expand light rail and continue to be the largest provider of rail design to Network Rail in the UK. We're also continuing to position our resources for global aviation opportunities, given that air traffic projections are forecast to grow over the next decade in most regions. An example of the positive change at Jacobs is our successful leveraging of capabilities from the U.S. to support ongoing work with the Brisbane airport expansion in Australia. With regard to some recent awards, in addition to the Network Rail win in the UK, our Buildings & Infrastructure group won a major U.S. military program that we hope to announce in the next few months. And we've been awarded a significant architectural engineering design project on an airport transportation program in Europe. Also, as recently announced, we acquired J.L. Patterson & Associates. J.L. Patterson brings additional consulting and professional services engineering capability in rail planning, environmental permitting, designing, and construction management. The acquisition enhances Jacobs' rail services capability on the West Coast and positions the company in the top tier of rail professional service providers in North America. So in summary, we believe our global Buildings & Infrastructure business has high potential growth opportunities, and we're well positioned to leverage our expertise in several exciting markets. Moving to slide nine, our Aerospace & Technology business is experiencing positive momentum. Backlog stands at $4.9 billion and excludes over $250 million in contracts that were awarded to us in the first quarter but not yet posted in our bookings due to elevated levels of protest. We're seeing positive dynamics associated with federal government funding in both the U.S. and the UK after recent budget agreements. This provides greater certainty and stability for the programs that we support. However, as I mentioned, in this market the procurement cycles are being extended and more awards protested. Related to this, our military range operations and maintenance strategic growth initiative is starting to pay dividends, as the investments we have made over the past couple years resulted in the award of multiple new contracts to Jacobs during December. While those awards have been protested, something that is fairly normal in today's U.S. federal contracting environment, we're confident of a favorable outcome. Meanwhile, our cyber-security, counterterrorism, and intelligence-related markets remain strong. Strategic investments such as our 2014 FNS [Federal Network Systems] acquisition are continuing to show benefits, and we're building strengths and capabilities to support additional growth in this market. We have a strong pipeline for advanced test and evaluation facilities with both the U.S. government and the commercial automotive industry. We're also seeing opportunities in the traditional environmental services sector. Of particular note is an emerging market driven by new regulations pertaining to the management of coal combustion residuals. This is expected to be a multibillion dollar per year market, and our differentiating experience with some of the major players positions us well. We're also experiencing positive trends in the nuclear sector associated with new builds, primarily in the UK, and continue to pursue selected growth opportunities in this sector. Recent key wins such as the 10-year facility support services contracts at NASA's Ames Research Center, an engineering services and skills augmentation contract option with NASA at Marshall Flight Center, and the EPCM spent nuclear handling project at the Idaho National Laboratory show the diversity of strength of this business. The Aerospace & Technology group has a good balance between discrete and long-term project work, and we expect to announce several additional wins that will bolster this group in the near future. I'll now pass it to Kevin to present more details on our financials. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve. I'm now turning to slide 11, as you follow along. As we've previously highlighted in our last earnings call, we were projecting a tough first half of the year. As a result, on a GAAP basis, revenue was $2.85 billion, as Steve noted, which is down 11% from a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues were down 7%. Gross margin dollars were $441 million. Importantly and consistent with our expectations outlined in our last earnings call, our professional services gross margin percentage picked back up in the quarter to levels above the full-year gross margin percentage of last year. This improvement was somewhat mitigated by the mix impact associated with lower-margin field services being a greater percentage of our business in Q1. As noted by Steve, tough cost controls drove our G&A down by more than $48 million versus a year ago. This was down over 13% and speaks to the aggressive measures we have taken and will continue to take to reduce costs in light of the current economic environment. As a result, adjusted operating profit was in line with our expectations at $128 million for the quarter. While our adjusted EPS of $0.78 was up 1% versus a year ago, it is important to note that the figure does include a discrete tax benefit of $0.09 in the quarter. To the positive, excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements versus last year, adjusted EPS would have increased to $0.80, up 4% versus the year-ago period. Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion and our book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.92. I will provide a little bit more color on these figures in a minute. Finally, operating working capital was $886 million. Cash was at $444 million, and net debt was at $181 million. Our balance sheet as a result continues to remain strong, while repurchasing approximately 1 million shares during the quarter, in line with our expected execution of our recently announced three-year share buyback program. So moving to slide 12, let me provide some further color on our backlog. Again, backlog currently stands at a combined $18.2 billion. This is down slightly from our last earnings call and 5% from our record high of $19.1 billion a year ago. The decrease from a year ago was driven by a combination of work-offs on existing projects, a softer sales quarter this year versus the near record quarter a year ago, and a significant negative foreign exchange impact versus the year-ago period of almost $500 million. From last quarter alone, the foreign exchange impact was over $100 million. Excluding the impact of the foreign exchange movements versus last quarter and versus year ago, our backlog was down less than 3% from last quarter and only 2% from our record high in Q1 a year ago. With regard to our professional engineering services backlog, this now stands at $11.4 billion, a slight reduction of 2% from last quarter. And of course, some of that was due to our foreign exchange dynamic. Our field services backlog was down by 4% versus last quarter, but it is in fact up significantly from a year ago. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity, where certain of our lines of business that target customers in stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers. So let me turn to slide 13, where I would like to give you an update on the restructuring effort that was announced last year in July. As previously communicated, the focus of our restructuring has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to enhance our cost effectiveness. We believe our efforts will ultimately provide Jacobs with the ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating. While many of the original restructuring efforts are in various stages of implementation, a recently announced reorganization is now supporting identification of additional savings opportunities, as we evaluate actions that could benefit the business longer term. Our efforts continue to be focused on our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization, we are now forecasting the total one-time cost of our restructuring effort that was initiated in 2015 to approach $250 million, with annualized savings between $180 million and $200 million. This compares actually to our original savings estimate of year ago when we announced the program of $130 million to $160 million in annualized savings. Importantly, the cash portion of our costs and savings noted above approximate 55% and 85% respectively, resulting in a cash payback of the program of less than one year. So turning to slide 14, we showed this at our Investor Day last quarter. You will see our preliminary revenue and operating profit mix for the quarter. As you know, we are one of the most diversified E&C companies in the world. Our revenue and profit mix continues to evolve, indicating the strength of that diversity. For Q1, you will note that the Petroleum & Chemicals line of business represented the largest percentage of our total revenues. However, our Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology businesses combined represent more than 50% of the total overall profitability of the company. Importantly, these businesses are not impacted by the current headwinds seen in our oil and gas and mining and minerals end markets. Of course, some of the differences on profitability across our lines of business and specifically for our Petroleum & Chemicals business is that some house a larger portion of our field services work. As you know, field service tends to have lower margin levels given its higher percentage of pass-through revenues. I want to note that these pie charts represent estimates at this point in time, and our new segment reporting will become effective at our Q2 reporting period, given that we are now beginning to manage the business consistent with our new organizational structure. As a result, our final reported information will somewhat change given the finalization of our segments and segment reporting, including the determination of field services within each line of business. Regardless, the power of our diversified portfolio is proving advantageous. While we see certain of our businesses facing incremental pressures, particularly from reduced CapEx in the oil and gas and mining sectors, other parts of the portfolio are expected to help mitigate some of those pressures, providing greater levels of stability and/or growing sales and profits. So before handing it back over to Steve, I also wanted to provide an update on capital allocation on slide 15. As highlighted last quarter, we spent $422 million in share buybacks during fiscal year 2015 and fully utilized the 2014 share buyback authorization of $500 million. During Q4 of 2015, we announced a new $500 million share buyback authorization with a term of three years. During Q1, we began executing against that program in a measured approach, consistent with our guidance. We remain confident in our ability to generate sustainable long-term cash flow, and we continue to believe our share buyback program is an appropriate use of cash, given the company's long-term value creation outlook. Our strong cash flow dynamics supports our ability to return capital to our shareholders while still providing flexibility to support our growth aspirations longer term. Finally, as evidenced by working capital and accounts receivable performance improvement targets now being part of our annual incentive program, we also believe we can improve our cash flow this year and longer term, which will further support our flexibility going forward. So with that, let me hand it back over to Steve for some additional comments. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Kevin. Moving to slide 17, as part of our reorganization, we established a global sales center of excellence. This is a critical step that enables us to transition from the previously centralized sales approach to a simplified organization and better integrates overall business accountability within each line of business, with the ultimate objective of driving sales to a much higher level of performance. Key near-term objectives by the sales center of excellence include : ensuring that we attract, retain, and develop the highest caliber sales team for sustained competitive advantage; and also to drive increasing sales effectiveness, with a focus on innovation and best practices that result in clear value to our clients and significant profitable growth. While it's early days, we're seeing strong ownership and buy-in from our global sales force, who are now fully integrated in the lines of business. And we believe this positions us well to get back on a solid growth path; more in the coming quarters on specific progress. Turning to slide 18, as I mentioned last quarter, further strengthening project delivery is a top priority at Jacobs. Our new project delivery center of excellence is off and running and playing a more prominent role in the successful management and delivery of our projects. This is driving increased focus on accountability across the organization. We're also implementing a number of specific project delivery related initiatives to improve performance, including upgraded tools and better standardization across global offices. The initiatives will both strengthen our project performance and reduce our operating cost. Each line of business has appointed a project delivery leader, who is accountable to ensure adherence to best practices and procedures. These initiatives are designed to have both an immediate and a long-term impact. So turning to the last slide and to summarize, we continue to hold to our previous fiscal year 2016 guidance. While our first quarter results met expectations, we continue to believe that the first half will be impacted by the difficult market conditions. And as a result, we expect our underlying second quarter results versus a year ago to be similarly challenged, as was our first quarter result. The economic dynamics of commodity such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business. However, we remain cautiously optimistic on the second half of the year, as cost savings benefits ramp-up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We're already reaping benefits from the restructuring and newly established organization, and we expect it will yield additional improvements as we move through fiscal year 2016. We're seeing a clear energy building across Jacobs. With senior leadership solidified, our focus is now on winning business and successfully delivering projects for our customers. Our value proposition and focus on key client relationships, market and portfolio diversification, smart use of cash, and fostering great talent are all helping to get Jacobs back on track to grow profitably. To support our business, greater clarity on strategic growth is needed, and so we're underway with our strategic review. We believe the initiatives we have undertaken and those we continue to implement are aligned with shareholders' interests and will ensure we are well positioned to drive long-term profitable growth. So with that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : Our first question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning, I guess a couple questions. One, Kevin, just on the guidance, you've kept the guidance the same. You now have the tax benefit of $0.09. We've bumped up our restructuring savings, which you could argue adds maybe $0.15. I guess it depends on the timing. But I guess how do we think about that? Does that imply you expect the core business relative to where you were last quarter; the underlying fundamentals have declined $0.25? If so, which businesses are driving it? Is it the incremental awards you expected this year in Chemical that you don't get, or is it projects are being slowed? I'm just trying to figure out how I think about the puts and takes of the guidance. I guess that would be my first question. If I could also get another one in there. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Jamie, sure. First response to the tax item, we did expect that we were going to see some tax benefits over the course of the year, timing of which is perhaps a little bit different. But we did expect that we would be able to see some benefits there. But I do think as we look to continue to drive costs out of the business, certainly the fact that we're able to deliver incremental costs does imply that certainly there is incremental potential pressure on certain of our businesses because of the continuing pressure on some of the commodity prices. So we think and believe that we are able to \u2013 be able to offset some of that with our incremental investments in terms of the ability to drive our reduction in SG&A. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess in particular, I think last quarter you talked about \u2013 can you just talk about where you think backlog should be this year relative to what you said last quarter? And I also think last quarter you talked about some larger chemical projects hitting the back half of the year. Can you just provide an update on that? And then I'll get back in queue. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. So look, let me first say, I think the quality of our backlog is strengthening, where the business that we're winning is higher-margin business as some low-margin backlog gets worked off. So I think generally, as we're analyzing our backlog, we're pleased with that. We did refer to a major chemicals prospect and we did announce that with the BASF project recently, and so we're going see the benefits of that now start to hit as we start earning some of that benefit. And we do have some really interesting prospects that we hope to lay out here over the next several quarters that contribute to the backlog. I mentioned the $250 million Aerospace & Technology wins that we have not put in the backlog because we want to finish up the protest activity, but we're very confident that that will hit the books here in 2016. So we can't give any specifics on where the backlog is going other than we're pretty excited about our prospects. And as I mentioned, it's all hands on to start getting back to growth. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, and then sorry, just one more question, just in terms of guidance. I know you said a stronger second half versus first half. But, Kevin, do you see the first quarter as the bottom? I guess your fourth quarter your gross margins were lower. But as we think about 2016, do you expect I would assume sequential margin improvement on the gross margin line in the second quarter? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think there is a mix dynamic going on, and we don't provide all that specific in terms of guidance relative to that particular issue, Jamie. But we do think that there is in our backlog, as Steve mentioned, there's some good margin going forward. And I do believe, if we think about the balance of the year, specifically second half, we hope to see that burning. But ultimately, we're going to have to be very diligent on the cost side, on the cost management side, because we are in a period of where there are some pressures on certain of our end markets. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. I'll get back in queue. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. So, Steve, last quarter you had these relatively significant write-offs in your business, which did impact your gross margin. And this quarter, gross margin did improve sequentially. You talked about this a little bit to Jamie's question. But how do we think about the tradeoff between price pressure and the current environment on gross margin and your ability to improve gross margin through better execution? Can they balance each other? Can you see relatively stable to improving gross margins throughout the year as the pressure from these previous write-offs die off? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I think you're focusing in on something that we're spending a lot of time at Jacobs, is to make sure we're doing a much better job of measuring what we call our underlying margin. So trying to look past some old write-offs that hit the books and really look at what's happening to underlying pricing and how we're improving the mix to drive margin improvement. And there are a lot of moving parts to that, and mix is a big piece of what happens at Jacobs because of our diverse portfolio. But all in all, when we start to really analyze, and we'll have more information that we can share starting in the second quarter when we report line of business results, we're pretty pleased with how margins are holding up. We're maximizing our high-value execution center in India, and a lot of our customers are locking in on that. So we can have a win-win with our customers on sharing the benefit of work share between multiple offices, including India. If I look at Aerospace & Technology, for example, a lot of the new business that they're winning is higher-margin long-term business, and it's replacing lower-margin business that's falling off the books. And I'd say, all in all, every business line is doing an excellent job on managing margin. And I'd say they were fairly flat to modestly up in most cases in the first quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. And then, Steve, you were pretty excited at the Analyst Day in talking about the life sciences and pharma marketing. You still are. But when we look at the Industrial backlog, sequentially it is down a little bit, even with this Biogen award. So how do we think about the Industrial business in particular and the positive impact from the life sciences and pharma market over the next year? Is that enough to offset mining and other weak industrial markets to grow that particular backlog as we go over the next year? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think clearly if you look at the last four or five quarters, most of the major movement downward in the backlog clearly was driven by our Mining & Minerals business line. And we think that's now stabilizing at the bottom and don't view that we're going to see a material change now driven by Mining & Minerals because it's come down so much. And in fact, as I mentioned in my remarks, of the few major projects that are out there, we're actually expecting to win the majority of those. And so that will start positively impacting our Industrial group's backlog. And as you mentioned, we're excited about the life sciences. That's clearly been an offset to what I just talked about, to be able to hold up the Industrial backlog where it is. And so I believe as we start looking forward in Industrial, we're going to see at some point a positive turn in the backlog. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just to press you a little bit, do you think it's relatively soon, Steve, or is it at some point meaning you still have to absorb a little bit more mining and it's more like the year 2017 for a turn in Industrial? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Again, I'm not going to be much more specific than that, but I would say my remarks are relatively near term. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm wondering if we could start with two questions around the infrastructure business. In the U.S. it sounds like you're seeing a nice pickup in activity. I'm wondering if you could quantify for us in terms of number of bids or just provide some context that looks like we're seeing an acceleration at the state level. I would love to hear some direct color from you. And then separately on the Middle East infrastructure business, can you just talk about what's the risk of project deferrals based on the moves in the commodity deck recently? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right, our business in the U.S. is both buildings and infrastructure. Clearly, we're seeing positive momentum on the infrastructure side, some specific initiatives being driven by the fact that the federal spending outlook is more positive than say it was a year ago. And with the recent budget approval, we're seeing more certainty, especially at the state/regional level around our infrastructure side. Some of it is very regional. We're seeing strong demand in Texas, the West Coast, Florida, for example, on the infrastructure side. When we look at the whole market, mission-critical is something we're pretty excited about and strong and believe we have excellent growth. And part of it though is the timing. We were impacted in the first quarter in mission-critical, and it was just simply our customers making some decisions on timing that were different than our expectations, but we expect to play it out as the year unfolds. So we're pretty diverse in Building & Infrastructure, as I outlined, and so there's lots of activity. This is clearly a business that is a lot of small wins that add up to what we believe is something that could be very positive as we unfold our strategy. The infrastructure comment around the Middle East I would say is net positive. Yes, there's a concern that in the Middle East as oil prices have dropped that there could be some delays in infrastructure spending. But we're starting from such a small level that generally we see that as a positive over the near term in the Middle East. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And sorry, that last comment, was that from small levels from Jacobs' standpoint or from broader infrastructure investment in the Middle East? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say both, but clearly from a Jacobs standpoint we see a very large opportunity in the Middle East. And even as maybe some of the activities get delayed, we believe that we're going to have growth in Infrastructure over the near term in the Middle East. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And lastly in your downstream business, you had a nice pickup over the past two quarters now. Can you just flesh out for us what type of activity is gaining traction? We're seeing pretty challenged CapEx budgets for refiners overall, and it sounds like you're either gaining share or maybe have higher OpEx exposure. Can you just flesh that out for us? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, as I mentioned first of all, a very strong piece of our global Petroleum & Chemicals business is sustaining capital and maintenance. And the team has done an excellent job on really focusing in on that starting several quarters ago, and we're getting a lot of wins. And one thing that's happening on both the oil and gas and mining side is that there is still pretty strong production, even on the mining side, as prices have collapsed, there's a lot of production. And so we're seeing a lot of sustaining capital in maintenance and safety, environmental across the globe. And we are one of the major players in that sector, and it is a big piece of our business. And so that's enabling us to hold up in a very difficult environment. Specifically refining, we're doing a great job on the independent refiners who are benefiting from the lower crude oil and are spending at maybe a higher rate as compared to the integrated players, and we've got some good wins in that sector. And I think our new focus with the line of business in Petroleum & Chemicals is demonstrating some early success in that arena. And on the Chemicals side, as a lot of these ethylene initiatives and cracker initiatives are going up, there's going to be a lot of byproduct activity in specialty chemicals and derivatives, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, et cetera. And that's in our sweet spot, and we're pretty positive about what's going to unfold there as it relates to Chemicals. So the downstream has been a good offset for us in a very difficult upstream environment. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. One of the things that we've learned over the last few cycles is that E&C companies experienced market dynamics with a lag. So how comfortable are you guys \u2013 that what we've seen recently with commodity prices with what we're seeing in the customer CapEx announcement that's really properly reflected in what that lag effect could be on your fundamentals over the next few quarters, or is this more that there could be a more challenging dynamic in 2017 left to come as well? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Again, I'm going to be repetitive here. But when I look at the backlog and analyze it, the big hard hit areas, major spending in the mining and upstream oil and gas for the most part has played out in our backlog because in today's backlog, there's very little represented there in those two hard hit sectors other than our sustaining capital and maintenance position, which we think we could even grow in a difficult environment because that's where those sectors are spending. And then you add on top of that that in the past we were somewhat over-dependent on key large players in those sectors. In the past year or so, there's been a big push to diversify and spread our wings across that industry. And so we are gaining a lot of new customers that we haven't had in the past. And as I mentioned, with the downstream focus and the size that we participate in maybe as compared to some of our competitors where we tend to be in more of the smaller mid-size range and not overly dependent on cancellations or deferrals of big large projects, we feel like, although visibility is not very clear because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the industry that based on the recent activity, at least we haven't seen signs that we're missing something from a lag effect or a lot of the recent announcements, but we'll see. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sorry, I would just add an additional comment. We continue \u2013 in backlog we're not seeing really any fundamental material cancellations that are occurring. We did have some of those early last year. So to Steve's point, we think that's largely played out. And then I think the other part that's appropriate to talk to is again the diversity of the rest of the portfolio, which is going to be we believe an opportunity for us, which will help offset some of the pressure points that you're highlighting in your question. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. Just to come back to pricing a little bit, how quickly are you finding that it's changing from your customer perspective in the requests to you? And to what extent is it mostly just pronounced in the private sector, or is it public sector as well? And to what extent are you seeing increasing pricing pressure in the public sector as well? And I know you mentioned there are protests on contracts, but how about pricing pressure there? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look, pricing pressure is happening everywhere. And it's not surprising, the world's getting smarter, there's more attention across all businesses. But as I mentioned earlier, we're mitigating that with several things. One is a real good focus of understanding where we're differentiated, where we can make money, and shedding some low-value businesses and therefore getting an upgraded mix in our sales activity. And it really is starting to play out as we analyze each and every one of the four lines of businesses. And I as mentioned before, the Aerospace & Technology, which is probably our most differentiated business, yes, there's a lot of protest, but a lot of that is just the nature of the way relationships have changed in that industry over the last several years. And we believe that our reputation, our differentiated offering, our capability, experience that we're actually going to be able to see general improvement in margins there and in growth. Clearly, in places like Petroleum & Chemicals, that's where there is the highest level of challenge on pricing, as you would expect. But I think the combination of our cost improvements, including our variable costs, and then the work that we're doing with our customers to look at ways to drive down cost, including the India work share, as I mentioned, all in all is helping our mix and margins, and we're pretty pleased with the way that margins have held up in that business. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Kevin, sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But I just want to maybe get a clearer update on where we are on the restructuring actions that are in place. Can you give us at the end of the quarter what portion of the costs have been incurred of the estimated, the new estimate of $250 million? Where were we at the end of the first quarter? As well as the savings, where do we exit the quarter on the run rate versus the $180 million to $200 million as the new range? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We didn't provide ultimately the specificity to that level of detail, but let me give you a couple points. Through the first quarter, we had spent about $150 million. Last year I believe was the figure, so if you add our current quarter spend, we're in the neighborhood of $220 million plus or minus. We had probably been able to get into our results last year roughly 25% of the expected savings, and you can see the SG&A figures for Q1 were obviously quite good versus year ago, so you can see that that's continuing to build. We are taking actions in Q2, further actions. So the run rate ultimately that we will realize of the number that we're talking about in terms of the savings right now will not fully be seen in 2016 because some of that's going to be done, let's call it midyear by the end of Q2. So we'll still have some incremental benefit that occurs in 2017. But basically by the end of Q2, we'll be pretty close and getting pretty close to the run rate as it relates to our quarters going forward. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got you. As you went through the plan and I guess maybe a little bit more detail on the opportunities that led to the increase? And it sounds like, Steve, from some of your comments that there might even be more as you roll up your sleeves and look at the business. Maybe some of the buckets or some of the opportunities that surfaced I think would be helpful. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's much more of the same kind of ideas, with the incremental focus is that we are getting relative to the lines of businesses, they're able to start to focus at a more detailed level across a greater expanse of our business to identify potential additional focus areas and cost reductions in both labor and real estate. And so those opportunities are developing as we speak. And I think there are going to be additional actions, I should say, that will allow us ultimately to realize a little bit better than what the numbers that we ultimately have right now look like. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. And my final question... Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I guess I'd just want to add to that. I just want to say yes, you heard it correctly that opportunities continue to come in and be assessed for further efficiency and cost opportunities, and I think that's a high expectation around all of Jacobs that there's more to come. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. On Sellafield, this was a major contract obviously that's well known to investors that now has come your way. At least it was a major contract previously. Any boundaries you could give us on the timing of this, the overall size that you see this being in backlog? As we understand it, there are three main groups that are now divvy-ing up the Sellafield pie. It looks like you guys are involved with two of the three. Can you give us some context as to what this could mean in terms of your earnings and your bookings? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I can just give you some general data that would help you, and then see what you can figure out on your own. But it's approximately 600 people involved at Jacobs for that. We're supporting the entire lifecycle of studies, design, construction management, operations, maintenance of the projects there. We're going to be supporting the decommissioning. And so these are framework contracts with periods of up to 10 years, and so it's going to be something that's going to help us for the long term, and it's a pretty important part of our whole nuclear strategy there. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on budget commentary on the line-of-business repositioning. Is that fully completed now? What are some of the positive and negative lessons learned as far as human resource needs and leadership in the key positions? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So the line-of-business reorganization has been implemented. And so we're off and running now, managing under these four lines of businesses. And it's going extremely well, a lot of excitement coming out, especially as now for the first time, we have these four business presidents able to have a clearer picture of how these sectors roll up globally and the opportunities to drive efficiency and cross-office market strategies among several other things that we believe are going to lead to improved profits and growth over the long term. And so I would say generally it's been impressive on the speed and execution. Everybody is locked in on it, and I think it's going to help us clarify our strategy now over the next several months as we undergo strategic review on each of the lines of businesses. And each of them are dissecting their portfolio and seeing some very interesting things that hopefully we can impact in the short term. So I would say, without trying to overly hype it, it's hard for me to think of any negative lessons learned in that generally everybody is building momentum. And the main reason that it's moving so quickly and building momentum is, as I came into the company, as I mentioned before, this isn't something that I decided that from my past was the right way to run the company. It was just an overwhelming set of inputs to us that we need to move in this direction, that we have tremendous opportunity if we can focus and better integrate and hold accountable global lines of businesses. And so I think that's the main reason why I'm pretty positive about the way it's unfolding. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful, just a few follow-up questions. Geographically, the restructuring efforts, are they changing your geographical presence in a material way? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, no, not at all. If anything, clearly, if you look at each and every one of the lines of businesses, geographic expansion will most likely be part of the strategy because we're very strong in certain geographies, but have left maybe potentially on the table some interesting opportunities in the past that we now just need to seriously consider. And we'll be selective and make sure we can win, and it needs to be profitably growth driven, not just growth. So more to come on that. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just a clarification on one of the questions that was asked earlier about the 2016 guidance. The $0.09 tax benefit that is now included, was it included previously when you reported last quarter, or is this a new addition to guidance? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We did have some estimates relative to tax benefits assumed in the full year. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT : Good morning, Kevin and Steve. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT : Steve, since Analyst Day here in New York, equity and bond markets have become more fearful. Economic activity and the data seem to be coming in worse than anticipated. As you look through your business and maybe some of the history you've had in your career, is the market too overly pessimistic, about right, maybe not as pessimistic enough about what you see in business conditions, not only just U.S., but in some of your major end markets globally? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me just frame the answer around how we're responding to that uncertainty, because we don't know, and we're not experts on being able to predict the oil markets or what's going to happen to copper prices or iron ore. But again, what excites me is as we have everyone now focused, more transparency, more rigor, more accountability, as big as we are and as diverse as we are, there's a huge opportunity of growth just based on, in many of the cases we're starting with small shares, and yet we're very strong in where we have those small share of businesses. And so even in this difficult environment, it feels like there's good opportunity out there. But clearly pressures that we have to manage through and a changeover in our backlog, for example, that is working off some old business as we get out there and execute the type of things that I'm talking about. And so, I think it's uncertain. We're not banking on oil prices going up or mining prices going up. When they do, we're going to be positioned extremely well because of our more efficient and even more efficient cost structure in the future. And so we're excited about when that happens, we'll be positioned well. But as we talk now in the near term, it's all about going after opportunities that are in front of us, and it feels like those opportunities should also allow us to see some modest growth as we execute them over the near term. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT : It seems like you have an increasing confidence that Jacobs as an organization has a better chance to win more business, even though the opportunities and the projects and maybe overall activity may not be as robust as it was, say, six to 12 months ago, given the restructuring and where you're targeting your manpower. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I think you said it well. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT : Excellent. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Steve, have you seen any irrational bidders jumping into the space, some of your more challenged space? And if they have or you expect them to, what is the customers' approach to that given it's been mixed for them in the past? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Unfortunately, in my entire career, I've always faced some irrational competitors. But just putting that comment aside, again, in our business where we have longstanding relationships and have a very strong reputation on our various capabilities, it's all about execution. It's all about being more efficient. It's making sure that we're raising accountability and expectations, making sure we're upgrading the talent and all those things we're doing. And it all started even before I arrived, and we're accelerating it with the new lines of business. I'm not sitting here today worried about irrational competitive behavior. I'm more excited about that there are a lot of things in our control to improve this company, both top line and structure. So that's what we're focused on, and so it's not the top of mind with regard to what you're concerned about. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, okay. And, Kevin, can you comment a bit about how we should be thinking about free cash flow? You're going to be seeing more savings coming through your restructuring plans, but at the same time, a little more cost. Any kind of guidance qualitatively even would be helpful. And then perhaps you both can maybe comment on capital allocation, any incremental update? Your slides are the same, but any change to that post the Investor Day you guys posted? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Perhaps some, let me make some high-level comments on the question. First thing is we do expect our cash flow to improve over the balance of the year versus first quarter. And the first quarter typically it's not always the case because, depending upon what the end balance sheet data is, there can be fluctuations by quarter. But generally speaking, Q1 tends to be one of our softer cash flow quarters. And so I fundamentally do believe there will be improvements over the balance of the year. I did make the comment in the prepared remarks that we expect to start to generate some improvements in our working capital efforts, and we do believe that will translate into improvements in cash flow over the balance of the year. So I think that that's the focus area for us on the balance of 2016. And clearly if we make progress there, we fundamentally believe those are sustainable going forward, which translates into our ability to be able to improve cash flows longer term. I don't know that I want to get into much more detail than that. But I do feel the team is focused. The lines of businesses are actually accelerating and supporting incremental focus against the effort. And so I do believe that we're going able to see some progress there. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And capital allocation, I know you reiterated everything in your slides. Any update there in terms of buyback, et cetera? Your stock has clearly reacted to oil prices, yet it seems that the initiatives you're taking, your non-energy markets are performing well. Does that make you perhaps a little more aggressive in your buyback? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Our discussions with the board is that we would have a measured approach to our share buyback at this particular point in time. That's unchanged. The capital allocation, as we've suggested in previous discussions, is that we will look to finalize our strategy. That work is ongoing, as Steve outlined, and that will ultimately provide some additional clarity as it relates to what the growth opportunities look like and what the cash needs associated with those might look like and consequently what any potential revised capital allocation strategy might look like. So more to come on that, and I think it's ultimately got to be intimately tied to how we'll expect it and finalizing our growth objectives longer term. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, folks. Operator : The last question comes from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, just a couple of follow-ups. Steve, based on your comments, it sounds like you've got some confidence, especially with some of the chemical and government projects, that you can grow backlog by the end of this year. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look, I'm confident that we can get back on the growth track. I don't want to give any specific guidance on backlog or timing other than I do expect to see the backlog reverse at some point in the near term, and it's just based on what I've talked about before that most of the hard hit areas, specifically upstream and mining, represent a small portion of our backlog. And I'm pretty excited about some of the prospects that we have in some of the better growth dynamic businesses. And so hopefully that's going allow us to see a trend positively in our backlog at some point. John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And just to be clear, I think, Kevin, you said that you've seen some cancellations in early FY 2015, but you haven't seen any recently or significant ones recently. Is that fair? Just give me... Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, there are always pluses and minuses in every quarter. John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yes. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But the ones that we talked about and actually highlighted were at the beginning of 2015, and we really haven't seen material changes at this particular point in time since the perhaps first and second quarter of last year, as I recall. It could be off a quarter there. John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Sure. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But certainly, we haven't seen those dynamics. And again, to the point that Steve was alluding to earlier in our comments, we think we've settled as it relates to some of those dynamics, and hopefully there will be upside going forward at some point in time. John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, and then just one quick follow-up. Kevin, the $20 million to $30 million left in restructuring cost that you mentioned, are those largely going to be absorbed in this current quarter, or are they spread through the rest of the year? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There could be some leakage that will go beyond because of items that, as I've always said, there will be some areas that because of certain efforts in terms of employees and notification and whatnot, some of the processes that are entailed relative to that, which could leak and/or a real estate play. There could be some beyond, but I think the bulk of them will be executed through the end of Q2. John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Demetriou, President & CEO, for any closing remarks. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you all for calling in, and look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, all. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Jacobs Engineering second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Berryman, CFO. Please go ahead. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Austin, and good morning and afternoon to all. We welcome everyone to Jacobs' 2016 second quarter earnings call. I will be joined on the call today by Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO. I must say I love that hold music that was there as we enter into our call. We'll be a little bit more upbeat perhaps than the music that you are hearing. Okay, as you know, turning to slide two, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we will be posting a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks. Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement. Any statements that we made today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain. And you should not place undue reliance on such statements, as actual results may differ materially. There are variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected, or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including: Item 1, Business; Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; as well as other filings with Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. So please now turn to slide three for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with some comments on our Beyond Zero safety culture here at Jacobs, followed by a summary of our second quarter financial results. He will include summary comments on the portfolio of our four lines of business, or LOBs, and also provide some commentary on end market conditions for each. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog, and financials for our new lines of business segment reporting. I will continue with comments on our current restructuring efforts and capital allocation. Steve will then discuss some next steps for the company, focusing on our project delivery initiative, strategic review, and some closing comments. We will then open it up for some questions. With that, I will pass it now over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our fiscal year 2016 second quarter earnings call. I'm on slide four. And before we dive into the results, I'd like to discuss our industry-leading Beyond Zero safety culture. At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, there's an unquestionable commitment to a safety-first behavior. And our culture of caring is not just what we do, but it's who we are. Through our relentless drive to improve safety performance, we have seen the number of incidents trend down over the last several years. For the first six months of this fiscal year, our overall injury rate as measured by industry-standard TRIR, total recordable incident rate, was at 0.24, considered top quartile performance and highly valued by our customers. This week, Jacobs is involved in the industry-wide Global Safety Week, during which our employees are engaged with customers and local communities on improving safety awareness, focusing on five topics, safe driving, energy risks, positive mental health, travel security, and safety innovation. We recently appointed Catriona Schmolke, a Jacobs veteran of 28 years, as our new head of Global Safety. And I have no doubt she'll continue to strengthen Jacobs' position as an industry safety leader. And importantly for shareholders, we recognize that companies that have sustainable best-in-class safety performance typically achieve superior operating and financial results. So at Jacobs, we believe safety is also a leading indicator and a key management metric which supports business performance and accountability. Moving to slide five, I'll summarize our second quarter business performance. We continue to experience very challenging global economic conditions, particularly in the petroleum and mining sectors. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, the more positive markets such as Aerospace & Technology, pharma/bio, and buildings and infrastructure helped us mitigate these more challenged sectors. Our revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion and our backlog ended at $18.2 billion, holding stable versus the previous quarter. A relentless focus on rightsizing our cost structure and driving efficiencies continues to benefit Jacobs. Through the first six months of this fiscal year, we have delivered $70 million of adjusted G&A cost savings to the bottom line, a 10% cost reduction versus last year. Our strong focus on upgrading and standardized project delivery tools, processes, and capabilities is showing early signs of success. In the second quarter, improved project performance was a key contributor to a sequential increase in our total Professional Services gross margin. Our bottom line results were solid, with adjusted earnings for the second quarter at $0.75 per share. And I'm also pleased with cash flow performance, which helped us end the quarter with a strengthened balance sheet. And we look forward to further improvements as our heightened focus on working capital takes hold in the second half. I'm now on slide six. And as we announced at the beginning of last quarter, we're now managing the company by four global lines of business. These are : Petroleum & Chemicals, which is comprised of upstream, refining, and petrochemicals; Buildings & Infrastructure; Aerospace & Technology, which covers our national public government business, primarily supporting U.S. and UK government agencies in the areas of defense, space, nuclear, and technology; and Industrial, which is comprised of Mining & Minerals, food, beverage, and consumer goods, Specialty Chemicals, Life Sciences, and Field Services. The charts on this slide show the breakouts of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each line of business excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOB shortly, but here we provide insight into the differing economics of each business, which provides a greater sense of profitability versus the top line. We believe the new financial disclosure will provide valuable insight on the diversity of our portfolio. For example, it's important to note that over 70% of our LOB profits year to date were driven by businesses that are not directly impacted by the hard-hit oil and mining industries. The stability of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure, and certain Industrial businesses form a strong foundation to drive profitable growth. And even within the Petroleum & Chemicals line of business, end market diversity has helped Jacobs remain resilient in a challenging macroeconomic and provides long-term opportunities to achieve profitable growth when oil and gas market dynamics improve. I'll cover our Petroleum & Chemicals group on slide seven. Crude oil prices fell below $30 per barrel earlier in the quarter and have rebounded to over $40 most recently. However, much of this increase does not appear to be based on supply/demand dynamics. Price volatility is expected to continue, and there's significant uncertainty in which direction oil prices will move. The most pressured segment is clearly the upstream side of our business, where it's all about cash preservation. For many of our upstream clients, it's a wait-and-see spending strategy. And any capital being spent is primarily going to projects to drive costs out, ensure regulatory compliance, and outsourcing plant maintenance programs, all areas of strength for Jacobs. Although our global Petroleum & Chemicals backlog is down from last year, mainly due to the heavily hit upstream sector, especially in the Canadian Oil Sands, this line of business started to stabilize over the last several months. We are pleased that the second quarter held flat versus first quarter, demonstrating the success our team has had in focusing on markets where capital is being spent. This includes the midstream side of the industry, where we're winning business in pipelines, terminals, and storage as our clients strive for more distribution flexibility and access to cheaper feedstock. The refining sector remains profitable, although margins have narrowed in recent months. We're seeing continued opportunities in global refining, with a focus on maintenance, turnaround activity and sustaining capital projects, as well as compliance mandated initiatives. One example of a recent success is a confidential client win for a significant five-year sustaining services contract. We're also involved in the early stages of a few large-scale refinery expansions and grass roots capacity projects across the globe. And we're seeing increased opportunities in process safety, an area where we can offer clients industry-leading capability. Recent momentum in the petrochemical sector is also helping us to mitigate headwinds. Our strategy to geographically expand in chemicals is paying dividends, as we're winning new framework agreements with several of the key global players. Many of our clients are adapting their facilities to capitalize on lower-cost gas feedstock, creating several opportunities for us to win plant revamp projects. Two recent examples of strategic client wins include a major engineering and procurement contract to support Monsanto's plant expansion in Louisiana, and also a cracker revamp project in Europe. We have also won a significant number of front-end engineering design projects in the first six months of this fiscal year, up versus 2015, providing Jacobs a great opportunity to convert these to larger-scope projects in the near future. So across our global footprint, our petrochemical project pipeline is getting stronger. Moving to slide eight, as announced in February, Bob Pragada rejoined Jacobs as President of Global Industrial. Consistent with his new responsibilities, we have added the Field Service businesses unit to the Industrial line of business, which is reflected in the backlog reporting shown here for all periods. Our mining clients are facing one of the most challenging commodity recessions of our generation. And similar to the oil and gas situation, it's all about preserving capital, reducing spending, and deferring projects for as long as possible. We believe we've hit a bottom in mining and that stabilized the business, especially in Asia and the Americas, with a successful focus on sustaining capital programs. We're also well positioned for a few larger capital projects that may get sanctioned in the mining industry and hope to announce a significant strategic win in the near term. Although our global mining backlog plummeted from 2015, our total Industrial backlog is up approximately $1 billion from last year due to our strong growth in Life Sciences, and held flat through the first six months of the current fiscal year. Our Life Sciences segment continues to benefit from a strong wave of new product approvals. For example, the number of new molecular entities that were approved were the most since 1996, and we see the strength continuing. As a result, the biopharmaceutical majors are heavily investing in new capacity. We had success winning many of the first wave of next-generation projects, including the large-cap programs for Biogen, BMS, and Novo Nordisk. The second wave is now in its initial stage, with planned investments by many of the leading global biopharmaceutical players. And we expect to continue to win a large share of these opportunities due to our industry-leading technical expertise and strong project delivery track record. In our Specialty Chemicals & Manufacturing sector, we're experiencing modest growth in the phosphate fertilizer market, which is driven by continued population increases and agricultural demand. Our team is doing an excellent job and following our customers to emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, and expanding from our traditional technology licensing model to full design supply contracts. In our Field Services business unit, we've had a number of growth opportunities in construction and maintenance as our clients continue to focus on near-term capital budget optimization and longer-term sustaining CapEx gains. Our diversity in services uniquely positions us to be a critical partner to drive best-in-class results for our products. Moving to slide nine, our Buildings & Infrastructure group saw a slight uptick in backlog to just over $4.8 billion. This global line of business covers a number of sectors. Beginning with Buildings, we continue to maintain our strong global brand, particularly in the federal space. We were recently awarded major contracts with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, General Services Administration, and the National Guard. The healthcare industry continues to grow due to an aging population and new medical technologies, and we're well positioned as evidenced by recent hospital project wins in San Francisco, Cincinnati, and Sydney. The corporate commercial building market is expanding for us. We recently won a major EPCM [Engineering, Procurement, Construction Management] contract for two manufacturing centers in the defense industry. We have also been awarded several national building contracts, including Vanguard, Sanofi, Amgen, and SAP. Very exciting is also an opportunity to provide planning, design, and program management for a major Education City in Australia. This represents a wave of future-connected, resilient, sustainable smart cities of the future. In mission-critical, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and a switch to software and apps is driving an expansion of data centers globally. We were impacted in the last few quarters by a temporary spending decline by our largest client due to a strategic schedule change. However, we expect to resume growth there soon. Infrastructure markets are also growing steadily. In the highway sector, our largest infrastructure market globally, we see continued opportunity to grow. The passage of the U.S. Highways bill is providing increased spending confidence and represents growth in high-mobility areas such as the West Coast, Texas, Southeast, and Virginia Mid-Atlantic. We are working on the largest integrated transport and revitalization project in Australia, and we were recently awarded a highway upgrade project in Adelaide. And in the UK, where we're a top provider of planning and design, we were recently awarded three significant contracts for Highways England. The global rail market is also steadily growing, as exemplified by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area positioning for a new $130 billion transportation revenue package. Recent major awards include a metro rail project in the Middle East, construction management for a large metro rail project in Seattle, and a multiyear CM contract for BART in San Francisco. Finally, we see increased investment in global aviation, where we're a leading planning and asset management company and a top design firm. We recently were awarded an airport design in New York and were selected to assist the American-US Airways rebranding for 80 airports across the U.S. Our Aerospace & Technology line of business is summarized on slide 10. We're pleased with the underlying backlog trends in this business. Although the year-over-year backlog declined, lower margin revenue burn has been replaced by new higher-value strategic sales, which is reflected in the strong second quarter operating profit performance. Also, as we've previously reported, the backlog excludes approximately $250 million of recently awarded but protested contracts, which by the way is three times the protest level of last year. We're confident, however, that most of this delayed backlog will be confirmed in the near future. Another positive trend is that Jacobs has won all our major contract rebids through the first half of this fiscal year, which contrasts with a 2015 industry benchmark of only a 25% incumbent win rate. Our recently announced U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center and NASA Ames Research Aerospace Testing and Facilities contacts are significant examples of this rebid success. Our U.S. government work, particularly with Homeland Security and intelligence-related markets, remains strong. Significant commercial investment in mission-critical and advanced investment design facilities continues in our pipeline of opportunities, and this area is increasing. As announced last month, we acquired the Van Dyke Technology Group, a 180-person firm, which enhances our capabilities in the fast-growing cyber security and intelligence-related markets. We expect to significantly leverage the acquired capabilities globally across Jacobs' public and private sector clients. The U.S. environmental market sector represents excellent growth potential for Jacobs. Most notably, we recently finalized a framework agreement with BP, a core client of Jacobs, for environmental remediation. In addition, we leveraged our strong environmental experience to win a significant construction services contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the UK, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be around $20 billion over the next five years. A large portion of the spend will be at Sellafield and prioritized around high hazard risk mitigation, where we are positioned well as an incumbent. The final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear new build project, which represents a long-term upside for Jacobs, has been delayed, but is expected in the relatively near future. In Defense, we reached an agreement with the UK Ministry of Defence to extend the financially significant maintenance and operations contract for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, known as AWE, with a contract term through 2025. Also promising for us is the UK's decision to invest in naval shipyards, the F-35 fighter jet, and other platforms, providing an improved opportunity pipeline for Jacobs. I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financial results. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steve. And I'm now turning to slide 12. As we previously communicated on our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue. And as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just over 4% from a year ago. Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion, as Steve already highlighted, flat versus Q1 in a relatively challenging environment. We actually feel good about that stability. In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis was 0.94, slightly up from the last quarter. Gross margin dollars for the quarter were $444 million, resulting in an improved gross margin profile versus Q1, up 50 basis points to 16%. Importantly, this improvement was driven by our Professional Services gross margins, which was at the highest level since 2014, an indication of our improving execution. This has allowed the company to more than offset some of the pricing pressure that exist in certain of our more challenged end markets. Benefits associated with our restructuring continue to gain momentum, resulting in our adjusted G&A being down $22 million versus the year-ago quarter. As Steve talked to, on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted G&A costs have now fallen over 10% versus the year-ago period, a clear indication of solid execution against our restructuring program. As a result, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $122 million, down modestly from our Q1 level. Adjusted EPS was $0.75 for the quarter. This includes a net positive impact of $0.03 from several items, including the successful resolution of an international tax litigation, a one-time benefit to non-controlling interest related to certain work performed with one of our partially owned subsidiaries, the costs associated with a litigation settlement, and the negative impact of a customer bankruptcy. Finally, operating working capital improved during the quarter, resulting in our net debt position at Q1 of $181 million turning to actually a positive net cash position of $27 million in Q2, the first net cash positive position that Jacobs has seen since the fourth quarter of 2013. This was driven by an improved free cash flow of $200 million during the quarter. And importantly, the improvement in our net cash position is after having spent an additional $30 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. Moving on to slide 13, I would like to provide some brief commentary on our total backlog. Our backlog currently stands at the combined $18.2 billion recently noted, which is flat from the Q1 figures. We are pleased with this performance, as our stability in backlog versus the last quarter was seen across the portfolio, including the Petroleum & Chemicals business. With regard to our Professional and Field Services backlog mix for the quarter, Professional Services now stands at $11.4 billion, and Field Services at $6.9 billion, both stable figures versus our Q1 figures. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity, where certain of our lines of businesses that target customers in stronger end markets have held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers. So turning to slide 14, I would like to spend a bit of time discussing our new segment reporting. For SEC guidelines, we have aligned our segment reporting with how we now manage in the business. To simplify our discussion and since this is our first time reporting our segment information, I've noted here on the slide our six-month results. I believe these six-month results are indicative of the overall trends in our business, but I will provide some additional color on quarterly numbers as appropriate in my following comments. You will note that three of the four LOBs have actually shown relatively stable adjusted operating profit performance over the first half of 2016, resulting in an improved margin profile in the first six months versus the year-ago period for our LOB segments. Our Petroleum & Chemicals operating profit margin, up 60 basis points to 3.5%, has shown resiliency in their year-to-date performance and actually held operating profit levels relatively flat in a tough environment. In fact, Petroleum & Chemicals adjusted profit levels increased in Q2 2016 versus the year-ago period, as our aggressive restructuring efforts resulted in cost reductions, which allowed for us to offset the drop in revenues year over year. Industrial profit is down versus the year-ago period, driven by the challenged Mining & Minerals end market and the margin benefits last year that were associated with large mining project closeout benefits. The business was also impacted negatively during Q2 this year by a litigation settlement and a customer bankruptcy. Going forward, the elimination of these items and the growing momentum in our Life Sciences unit bodes well for improving profitability in the second half of 2016. Regarding Aerospace & Technology, revenue declines and lower margin business have impacted the top line versus the six-month year-to-date figures of 2015. However, this business still delivered flat adjusted operating profit for the fiscal year first half, improving operating margins actually to 7.7%, up 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. The LOB also realized operating profit growth in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. Lastly, B&I revenue, while decreasing over the six months, we are optimistic about its ability to grow and deliver profitable growth going forward. Substantial benefits associated with our restructuring effort drove the LOB's improvement in adjusted operating profit over the first half of the year. This resulted in operating margin rising to 7.3%, or 70 basis points up versus the year-ago period. As we look ahead, we like the makeup of the LOB diversity, as long-term market dynamics in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology, and Industrial, specifically Life Sciences businesses, position the company well for growth. And with Petroleum & Chemicals, we believe this line of business provides long-term opportunities to profitably grow when oil and gas market dynamics ultimately improve. Finally, a few comments about our corporate related costs, these non-allocated corporate costs consist of cost elements that some are inherently predictable, such as routine G&A expenses related to the corporation as a whole, acquisition-related expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, and other routine costs and expenses, but also includes other items that are inherently less predictable, including adjustments to employee fringe benefit programs, around medical, pensions, and other employee benefits, certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures, and margin adjustments on projects not related to LOB performance. These non-allocated corporate costs rose by approximately $19 million over the first half of 2016 versus the year-ago period. Increased legal defense costs, fringe rate true-ups, and expenses related to our strategy work represent the majority and the bulk of the increase in costs. We believe that especially as it relates to the more predictable elements of this line item that we now present in our segment reporting, we will be able to reduce these non-allocated corporate costs longer term. So before turning to make some additional comments on our restructuring, a few words about our segment reporting efforts. I really would like to call out the extraordinary efforts of the finance and accounting team here at Jacobs. I am thrilled that they were more than up to the formidable challenge to meet the aggressive timetable we set once we put in place the decision to transition to an LOB management structure. I know that the board and certainly myself would like to personally thank them. So I'd like to turn now to slide 15, where I would like to provide an update on the restructuring effort that was announced in July of last year. As we have discussed in past quarters, the primary focus of our restructuring effort has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to ensure we have a lean cost-effective structure. We have been very successful with our restructuring efforts and these are already benefiting our financials, as evidenced by the significant reduction in G&A over the last 12 months. These actions support the company's ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating. And we look forward to continued benefits in the second half of this fiscal year and the full-year impact in next fiscal year 2017. Our restructuring efforts are now nearing completion. Our primary focus continues to be on reducing our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily on labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization that we announced late last year or calendar year, we are now forecasting that total one-time costs of our restructuring effort to be $330 million to $350 million through the end of Q3 approximately, with final expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Importantly, the cash portion of both our costs and savings result in a cash payback of less than one year relative to this effort. Steve will discuss further in his closing comments coming up, but our cost reduction efforts to become more cost effective are not over as we close the books on this specific restructuring effort. Our initiatives to date have targeted reducing costs to match the realities of current market conditions, while on the next phase we will seek further cost synergies that are aligned with our strategic agenda and our ability to support a strategic growth agenda that is profitable. Finally, turning to slide 16, a few comments on our share buyback status. We continue to execute per our previous, resulting in $30 million of repurchases as in Q2 and increasing our year-to-date figures through the first six months of 2016 to $72 million, representing approximately 1.8 million shares being repurchased. Our previous guidance remains in place at this point in time that we will spend in a relatively consistent manner over the three-year term of the program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review and our plan is to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure at our Investor Day later this year. With that, let me hand it back over to Steve. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you, Kevin. Turning to slide 18 and as we discussed during the last several earnings calls, strengthening our project delivery performance is a top Jacobs priority. Our specific goals include providing our clients increased value with industry-best quality and execution while our shareholders benefit from increased Jacobs project profitability. To achieve this, we're driving several initiatives, including upgrading project tools, streamlining our procedures, and strengthening our global strategic sourcing. We're also defining top quartile benchmarks, driving innovation, and engaging all leaders to achieve best practices. We're beginning to see measurable improvement. Our project write-downs have been reduced by 21% versus last year, and our low-cost high-value India Execution Center work has increased significantly. We're also receiving positive feedback from our customers. Our client-approved value plus project savings currently stand at $4.7 billion through the first six months, and client satisfaction is running at greater than 92%. This is a long-term transformation, and much of the improvement is ahead. Many initiatives are underway, and we expect full rollout in fiscal year 2017. I'm excited for our employees when it comes to project delivery excellence. We're committing resources and investment that will unleash our people to excel at a high level that they desire to be proud about the work we deliver for our clients. Moving to slide 19, as previously discussed, we believe that developing and executing a profitable global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid and long-term industry-leading shareholder value. Demonstrating our commitment to this, Alan Dick, who has led large global functions and businesses utilizing strategic planning to achieve success, has joined Jacobs to lead our global strategy efforts. Late last year we commenced our strategic review. The first phase of this involves a deep dive on where we make money, by office, by customer, by our different project delivery models, and many other analytical slices. Our business leaders are now combining this data with a strategic lens to further optimize our global office footprint, with the goal of better serving our clients and extracting further cost synergies. When we roll out our strategy later this year, we will provide an update on the new and additional 2017 cost savings. To be clear, as we now approach the successful completion of the restructuring initiative which was tied to rightsizing Jacobs to the challenged market conditions, the next phase of strategic cost optimization will be more aligned with our strategic growth agenda. We're now moving into assessing current end markets and geographies along with potential new growth opportunities. Additionally, we'll evaluate those industries and businesses that do not earn an adequate return and make decisions on how to manage these to create shareholder value. Our goal is to have an overarching Jacobs strategy that provides a blueprint focused on profitable growth and additional cost efficiency opportunities, which leads to an improved return profile for the Jacobs portfolio longer term. Our strategy blueprint will also provide clarity on other key elements such as capital deployment and risk profile. We're targeting to review this with our board in July, and soon after will provide a strategic review to the investment community. So the last slide, while our second quarter and first half generally met our expectations, we continue to be pressured by a challenging global environment. The economic dynamics of commodity prices such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business, although our portfolio diversity remains a strength. Our cost savings initiatives should benefit the company as they continue to ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We expect both of these initiatives will yield additional improvements as we move through the second half of fiscal year 2016. Our first half performance gave us increased confidence that we'll meet objectives for the year. Consequently, we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.20. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions. Austin? Operator : And our first question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning. I guess a couple questions, one strategic and it relates to the guidance too. It's been a recurring theme. We increased our costs again associated with the restructuring. Kevin, is there any way that you can help me understand the savings that is implied for the full-year guidance now in the back half of the year versus your expectations before? Because you keep increasing your costs in the restructuring, and I guess it sounds like there's more to go after that. I guess I'm just trying to understand for 2016 how much of your earnings are being helped by the savings and how much in terms of a deterioration of your organic business, how much is that when I think about your 2016 guideance, if that makes any sense? And then I guess my other question, just more strategically, Steve, it was helpful to provide the margins by line of business. The profitability associated with some of your businesses is very interesting. And I guess based on some of the hires that you've also just announced, is it fair to say when you actually provide your color on your long-term strategy that there could be something more transformational here with Jacobs? Could we see \u2013 is there a bigger opportunity for divestitures of some of your businesses, or do you feel like a lot can be accomplished through internal self-help? Thanks. Sorry, I know there was a lot there. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's all right, Jamie. So I'll start first, and then Kevin will take your initial part of your question. But look, it's too early to comment on the strategy. We're looking at everything. As I mentioned, we're not moving into the phase of really understanding with the help of some outside experts where each of our markets are projected to go, and also look at things that we're not potentially strong or involved in, in the market could be exciting moving forward. And so there's a lot going on. We'll obviously look first and foremost at how do we organically go after that. And inorganic could \u2013 also M&A could also play into that. And I did comment we are going to look at underperforming markets and sectors equally as strong, and that could lead to some decisions, potential divestitures as well. But it's premature to talk about what that will look like. Is it going to be several different small to mid-size initiatives that add up to something big, or is it going to involve some transformational steps? I would say everything is on the table, and we'll have a lot more to talk about later this year. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, I just wanted to make sure you understood my question, because I knew it was long-winded. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I think I'm good. Let me take a stab and we can go forward and see if there's any additional clarity. Look, the dynamic of the restructuring, certainly there was phase one that we did before we initiated our realignment into the LOB structure. And so as the LOB structure came into play, and as you recall, this was announced in our first quarter I believe officially and formally in the first quarter of this year, and the teams have been forming and ultimately coming up with an idea of what the new structure looks like to help support their growth agendas. And so that has been a big driver to incremental benefits associated with the restructuring as you now see it. Specifically, as it relates to what's in the forecast for 2016, the reality is if you look at where we are right now in terms of our total costs to date, I think we're somewhere in the neighborhood of \u2013 in the middle $250 million figure numbers roughly. And so given that we've still got close to $100 million to go, that means that as we're executing now, the benefits of that really won't happen in a material way on a full annualized basis until we enter into fiscal year 2017. So certainly some of it is occurring this year. It certainly is helping as it relates to our ability to perform against our original expectations. And I would say that our guidance that Steve has provided is prudent as it relates to the current economic uncertainties that we're facing. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): But I guess the question I'm trying to ask is : is there a deterioration in the core business based on where you thought we were last quarter and the beginning of the year? Let's take your savings aside. Is there a change, or do you feel like for the most part the businesses that were showing declines are bad, but they've at least stabilized? Is there a change in your core business assumptions? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look, I think our overall theme today is stabilization. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Whereas a lot of things were declining throughout 2015 and even in the early part of our fiscal year, the last several months I think we've seen pretty strong evidence that we're hovering around the bottom in some of these more hard-hit markets. And we're not predicting when that's going to turn up, but feel like we've hit the stabilization point. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, I'll let someone else go. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. So it looks like you upgraded your Chemicals characterization from steady to strong. I'm wondering if you can talk about what is the biggest reason for that. I know it sounded like the feed activity picked up a little bit. But where would you say the pipeline is strengthening by type of chemical project? And if you could give some color on a regional basis. Is it still your best opportunities in North America, or is it more balanced now? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So there are several different things that we can comment on that. North America specifically is clearly our best-performing pipeline, if you will. And globally, when we comment about those numerous feed wins, first of all, they're up significantly from last year, the number of wins on the feed side, which are really the smaller portion of potential larger opportunities because where we've seen in the past is once we get into the feed win, there's a higher probability that we're going to be able to convert that to more work. Whether it's a full EPC or EPCM opportunity, it provides a significant pipeline to grow with those existing clients. So we're optimistic about that. Also, we have shifted very specifically beyond focusing on a set of core clients to spreading our wings and going after more of the pie and more of the market. And that's going very well, and we've announced some recent large framework agreements with some multinational customers that historically we haven't been as strong in. And so I'd say we're extending our reach. And then also there are several factors around the cracker world as far as our participation in some of the peripheral work around some of these large projects, but also more importantly, derivatives. So there are a lot of derivative opportunities that people are going now that a lot of this front-end capacity has put into the market. And that's an area where we're extremely strong. And so those are examples of different opportunities that are making us more bullish about chemicals versus some of the other petroleum and oil and gas markets. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, so part market and part your own strategy, it sounds like. In terms of directionally, how are you thinking about backlog for the remainder of the year? Do you think there are still opportunities to get growth out of this after being pretty flat for the year based on what you're pursuing? I know you mentioned a strategic win in mining and some delayed Aerospace & Technology bookings. Where do you think backlog could go from here over the next few quarters? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're not going to give any specific guidance to the backlog. But as I mentioned before, when we look at Petroleum & Chemicals as a whole, and mining, where we've been hardest hit, the theme is stable. Where we are more optimistic is in some of the Building & Infrastructure sectors and Aerospace & Technology. And where all that mix ends up, we'll see. But I think right now we're pleased that in the declining backlog areas, like the mining and upstream side of oil and gas, we feel like we've reached a point where that has stabilized. And so we're just doing our best now to go after wins across the different sectors. I will say one of the focal points for Jacobs as we continue to look at how to strategically adjust to address the market opportunities is we're looking more today than maybe we have in the past around selective larger projects where we're capable of strong project delivery capability. And hopefully at some point in the future, that will contribute to backlog growth. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. So gross margin continued to improve sequentially. You're at 16% from 15.5% last quarter. Gross margin is still a little lower than last year's level. So can you talk about your progress improving? You had some loss-making projects if you go through late year in your portfolio, and the balance really of execution versus a difficult pricing environment. Is your backlog gross margin higher than your revenue gross margin? So would you expect gross margins to continue to rise? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look, I would say that there's definitely a lot of discussion here at Jacobs around the whole price/volume relationship or margin/volume relationship, where in this environment we're more focused on strengthening the mix of our backlog going forward rather than chasing low-value business that is just going to not really play out successfully for Jacobs, and we're making good progress on that. And so generally, I would say, starting with Aerospace & Technology, there has been an excellent shift to burning off lower-value business and replacing it with higher-value margin business, and that's underway. And I think that as we go through the other sectors, there are similar success stories around that. And I feel like right now that's our focus, and I like the mix of businesses we're moving forward. And that will start to really pay dividends as some of these commodity cycles turn more positive to position us for profitable growth. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Is it fair to say that the backlog gross margin changes are at least equal to or higher than what you're reporting now? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry. You didn't come through clearly. Can you repeat that question? Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, I guess is it fair to say that your backlog gross margin is better than your revenue gross margin at this point? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Generally, I would say the answer is yes. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, Kevin, could I ask you about cash? Q2 I've never thought of as seasonally a very strong quarter for cash. It seems like you had very strong results. You talked about working capital improvements this year. So maybe you can talk about your outlook for cash moving forward. Was there anything one-time in the quarter in cash, lower taxing and something like that that allowed for such a good result? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks for the question. We don't really have a lot of significant cash items in the quarter per se. We did mention some things that occurred relative to some of the discrete or one-time items that we called out, but those weren't drivers of big differences in cash. I think ultimately, there are a couple of things I should call out. One, probably our Q1 cash flow was a little bit less than we would have expected. So Q2 is helping put us back on track and then some, so that is one comment I would make. But the other comment is we are focusing the organization on trying to improve our return profile, especially as it relates to our accounts receivable within the construct of the LOBs, and we're attempting to drive efficiencies into our total working capital at the corporate level as well. You've heard me say that I think we have opportunities to improve. I believe that that can continue to play out over the next years. It's pick-and-shovel work. You've also heard me say that. And I think ultimately, this is the first time we've really actually started to see some improvement as it relates to the efforts that have been in place for the last six, nine months. So we're happy to see that, and we're going to continuing to try and drive incremental improvements going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone. Kevin, can you talk about the Industrial segment margins in the quarter? What was the impact of one-off items? I guess excluding that, Industrial business margins expanded across the board for you folks. I'm wondering if you could also touch on when do the comps get easier for the Industrial businesses? Are they any easier in the back half of the year compared to what we've seen in the comps in the first half? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, I'm happy to do that, Jerry. I think that there are two things going on in the numbers associated with the Industrial business. There are some unique benefits that were realized in the first half of 2015, and there are some unique negatives that we saw in the first half of 2016. So your comparability figures are a little bit more challenged in the first half of 2016 than they would normally be. So as I think about how the comparability will look going forward, very much, much more favorable. And as I outlined in the call in terms of our prepared remarks, we do expect, especially since we will eliminate some of the one-time items that we saw in the Industrial business in Q2 of 2016, by default we expect the momentum in our Life Science business to start to pick up going forward in that particular business. So I do think we're going to be seeing a much more favorable picture going forward. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And, Kevin, just order of magnitude, the extraordinary or one-off items this past quarter, are we talking $1 million or $2 million, or is it more significant than that? Can you just frame it for us? And then just to confirm, just to your points, so the comps are easier in the back half of 2016 than they were in the first half because you don't have the positives that you alluded to? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, and to be clear, it's not $1 million or $2 million. It's more substantive than that in Q2 in terms of the takeaways relative to those issues. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. And then in the 10-Q for the Aerospace & Technology business, you spoke about some customers' preference for awarding contracts toward smaller businesses. Can you just say more about that? Is that a small subset of the customer base? Can you just expand that point, please? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's really related to the federal government. And a lot of their work they're looking to do set-asides for small businesses, minority businesses. And so the contracts that are being let by the federal government oftentimes have pieces of the business that we would have normally had access to are being set aside for these other smaller organizations. We partner with those organizations oftentimes. But it just means the percentage of the profit pool available to Jacobs is a little bit less. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi team, congratulations on a good quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So first question is when I looked through some of the contracts you've announced in the press release, Steve and Kevin, there seem to be some pretty interesting areas where we maybe haven't seen you guys being active. So can you talk about \u2013 as you look at your sales initiatives, are you seeing some market share gains and traction in particular you're excited about? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There's a lot to talk about, but I think you've definitely hit on a strategic shift for us that, as I mentioned earlier, we're still very much focused on our core clients, but we are also equally focused on addressing adjacent opportunities in those markets with more clients that we haven't served in the past. And it is definitely starting to play out and we're gaining some interesting wins. There are some examples of some bright spots across our business where we're seeing good momentum on that activity. I'll just look at Building & Infrastructure and Aviation, where for example, in the UK, our Aviation business has doubled versus 2015. And a lot of that is because of successes we've had some of our core Aviation clients who are now globally expanding their reach and winning aviation projects in Asia-Pacific and some other regions where we haven't been present. But, Tahira, I would just say, overall, it's a big part of our changing strategy, and I think there's going to be more to come as we play out more wins in the future. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, Steve. And is there a common thread in these where you have gained market traction that you've been able to identify and you can maybe replicate in other areas? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think a core change in the way we're going after it is the new line of businesses. Now that we have, for example, global Petroleum & Chemicals organized under one leader, the meetings that I've been involved in periodically, there's a lot of excitement and learnings coming out by putting all of our Petroleum & Chemicals regional leadership together and building off each other's regional success. And so we are globalizing previous regional successes at a much faster pace because of the new line of business organization. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, okay. That's helpful. I guess the second question, Steve and Kevin, we've seen technology companies strangely become more visible recently, largely on the facilities, the transportation and the building side, both with Google with Sidewalk. And as you know, Oracle just bought a technology-oriented infrastructure company. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in regards to smart city implementation and maybe 3-D buildings? We're seeing a lot of that coming up in the Middle East. Is this an opportunity for you guys? Is it more a long-term opportunity, or is it something that could happen pretty fast? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think the answer is this is definitely something that we're in the mix on. I commented on the Australia Education City. But when we look across the globe, our Building & Infrastructure team are on the front end on several of these smart city type initiatives, where we're seeing some preliminary opportunities, feasibility studies, some of the upfront planning. And what we would expect is that as we get through those and these initiatives get funded, we'll play a much bigger part. I think the question always is going to come down to funding. I'd say generally on the global infrastructure business, that's the big question mark. There's clearly a pent-up demand for infrastructure growth across the globe. And what we're seeing right now just hold that back generally across the globe is funding. And we're starting to see new creative funding mechanisms to start to move these necessary infrastructure projects forward. The question really is just at what pace that is. I can't comment on how quickly we'll see it, but the whole sustainable smart city opportunity is clearly an area of opportunity for Jacobs in the future. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just want to go back to your comments about project renewals in Aerospace & Technology. So have you seen any change in pricing in terms of the contracts that you renewed? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : As far as these rebids, I would say the margins have stayed solid. There has been nothing material that we can comment on with regard to what we're winning. I'd say the mix is better is really what my comment earlier was. As we are winning those rebids, if you will, and gaining some new additional business in different areas like mission-critical, et cetera, overall that mix is up versus historically, specifically last year. But as far as rebid contracts, I'd say they have been very stable in the margin rebids. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And now that you've given the new segments, I was wondering if you could perhaps talk about maybe some longer-term margin targets by segments in terms of how to think about that. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry, some longer-term what? Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Margin targets for your new segments, just how to think about that? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Look, I think more to come on where we're going to be working through on the strategy over the next two to three months. You heard Steve talk to the fact that we've done a deep dive on the economics of the portfolio. Now we're marrying that up with the strategic wins on competitive advantage, positioning across the globe, risk profiles to determine where we're going to be driving our profitable growth agenda. And look, I think it will certainly entail \u2013 at least some pieces of the strategy will be about ensuring that we have good solid gross margin, which leads to our ability to have profitable growth. But we're not in a position at this particular point to provide any perspective or specificity around that. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Andy asked earlier if backlog margin or job-level margins are higher than what's currently being realized in the P&L today. I guess when you marry that \u2013 and you guys said yes a little bit. So when you marry that with the incremental cost savings that you announced today, do you feel like the operating margin in total next year sees a lift? It feels like to this point that the margin and the actions have been more margin preservative than incremental. I'm wondering if we're getting to the point where we can actually talk about these being additive to the profitability of the company. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Andy, I think one of the key messages we shared today is that our cost optimization, cost reduction is not over, even though we talk about completing our previous restructuring. And so we continue to see opportunity at Jacobs to drive improvement in efficiency across the company in a meaningful way in many different areas of our spend. The restructuring was clearly heavily focused on adjusting our head count to the marketplace with some office initiatives. I think as we're now moving into the more strategic phase of our cost optimization, we're broadening that \u2013 all of our spend across Jacobs. And our initial assessment and the strategy work shows some significant opportunity over the next several years. So the reason why we're talking about that and doing that is we're not satisfied with the margins in this business, and we believe that there should be margin growth in all terms. So I would just say that our strategy expectation is for margin improvement over the next several years, and that's what we're going to go after with both the efficiency and mix of business that we're going after. And I'll just end that by saying what you should expect is that when some of the commodity businesses cycle back up with all this work we're doing on cost improvement, we should see eventually stronger margins in those businesses as well. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would add a comment specifically, and it's important to note the line of business margin profiles that have been presented today for the first time actually. And it's worth noting that in a challenged environment where actually many of the businesses have the reduction in revenues, their margins, operating profit margins were up year over year. And I think that's indicative of what Steve was saying is that, one, we're taking costs out of the system. And if you look at the core level of our segments and our operating profit by the lines of business, even within the construct of having some challenges on the top line, margins are going up year over year. And so I think that's consistent with the message that Steve is delivering. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's helpful. You talked about some of those non-allocated corporate costs burning off over time. Are you able to give us some context about what that level could be, $19 million for the year over year in the first half? So from here, is it a $40 million run rate for the year that next year could be $30 million or $20 million? Is that the right order of magnitude to be thinking about? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Look, I would say that ultimately I hope that we don't have the elevated level of legal costs forever. Let's put it that way. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Can I ask one follow-up on refining? It's interesting. A year ago refiners were making a lot of money. Crack spreads were wide. They've narrowed here more recently. And I was wondering if that's having an impact on their desire to spend. Your commentary has been fairly stable for a while. But I would imagine maybe that their economics are changing might affect you. Are you seeing any of that today? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Clearly we are, in our customer discussions, understanding that some of the more positive margin trends have now turned the other way. But where we participate, we're still seeing some good steady opportunities on the whole maintenance turnaround, a lot of regulatory opportunities. One significant opportunity in refining which is a real strong point for us is alkylation. With the change in regulations on C4s, there is a lot of work to build alkylation units to convert those C4s to high-octane blending opportunities for gasoline. And we fit right into that mix and believe that there's a pretty interesting pipeline of opportunities. So when you put all those type of things together, we continue to view this as a good steady opportunity for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. So I just wanted to go back to your comments about scrubbing some of the underperforming projects and regions, particularly in the Petroleum & Chemicals business. Do you find that it's more of contract pricing or structure or project structure, or is it more just cost inefficiency? And if it's more of a contract structure, how do you address the issue in the current environment, particularly with pricing pressure, more competition? I'll start with that. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look, I think generally you hit them all. I would say the answer is yes, yes, yes. And that's what's exciting us about now getting this information and deciding what to do with it. And so there are things that are in our control, like optimizing our office footprint and some of those \u2013 including also looking at where potentially we're not making money or just extremely low-value business, trying to decide how to shift our focus on those resources to higher-value opportunities that are clearly out there. But also, this is giving our organization much more capability to sit down with clients and have more discussion around win-win. And in many cases that wasn't happening. In many cases the awareness of the margin problem on our side wasn't as evident to our own people. And I think part of our next phase is going to move into really addressing even some of the pricing equations when it comes to opportunities out there. So just a high-level answer that all of those are showing up as an issue, which should lead to opportunity. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And if you I guess go to the client and ask for pricing increase and you do not get it, is that part of your potential exit strategy, or how would you address that? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that needs to be considered. If we're not getting a minimal return in an opportunity out there, I think we need to question whether that's the right use of our resources versus redeploying our people to higher-value opportunities. The one thing that I've learned at Jacobs through my early days here is that our people generally have capability to work across different markets, opportunities, businesses. And so again, I think this is something that strategically we're pretty excited about, optimizing the whole business model going forward. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And just to follow up on cash redeployment, I think you mentioned that acquisitions are potentially part of the mix. How quickly can you build up the pipeline of acquisitions or targets given that you've effectively been so much internally focused over the past two years? And I think you didn't bring up potential consideration of dividends. Is that still on the table for the August meeting, the board meeting? If you could address those two issues. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So just addressing the dividend one, Kevin mentioned about capital deployment strategy being part of our review. And so we'll have more to talk about all elements of our capital deployment at that strategic review. But as far as M&A, again, I'm really excited about the line of business structure, and that is another clear opportunity and momentum that's building in the company around all aspects of running a global business, which include more focus on reviewing a strategic M&A opportunity. I think Van Dyke was just a perfect example of an outstanding bolt-on acquisition that was initiated and led by our Aerospace & Technology team. And we're starting to have more discussion internally across all four lines of businesses on strategically profitable, attractive high-value M&A opportunities are starting to come into the discussion. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So if you do decide that M&A is part of the strategy, you could potentially do something bolt-on relatively sizeable in the next 12 months. How should I think about the timing of returning to the M&A market? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would just leave it with where it's starting to \u2013 the discussion is increasing. But as far as the pace, I'd just wait till we come out with our strategy to talk about where organic versus inorganic fits in. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Austin, perhaps we can take two more questions. Operator : Okay, sure. Our next question is from Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you for taking my questions, a couple of quick ones. When you look at the cost reductions, can you break them out for us? Where are they coming from by business line or by geography? Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's pretty broad-based across the world actually. I do believe that we have in the 10-Q, and I don't have it in front of me, Jeff, but we do have some information in the 10-Q as it relates to our current spending on restructuring by the lines of businesses. So I would refer you to the 10-Q. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up, so when you look at the early takeaways from your strategic review as you have it today, is it fair to say that whatever you have already identified has been reflected in these cost reductions, or are there still opportunities before we get to the final stages of the review? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The specific message is that what Kevin has talked about in cost reduction and restructuring, I think you've just got to look at that as the previous initiative, and we bucketed it all under that frame of numbers that Kevin shared. When we talk about now strategic, further strategic cost initiatives, we're targeting and expecting additional savings, and so more to come on giving some guidance on what that looks like as we complete the strategy work. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT : Thank you. For Steve, when you look at the foreign lines of businesses that you've created here in the past nine to 12 months, are there any that are positioned currently to take more aggressive projects, maybe trying to grab more margin, or maybe take a little bit more risk or fixed price on some opportunities than some of the others, or is that something that is going to evolve at the strategic review and you set up these businesses to work on their own footing? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, I'll take the latter, great question. The one thing I want to always repeat on these calls is we're going to challenge ourselves to look at how to take more intelligent risk, but I definitely don't want to leave our investor community thinking this is going to be a radical shift in strategy. We'd highlight what has happened at Jacobs over the last many decades and I think has built up a great company. I think we all believe there are things that we can do more of. That could be again a bolt-on adjustment to some of the risk profile that we've taken in the past, and I think the strategy work will help us articulate that. So I think the latter part of your question/answer was the right way to look at it. Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT : Thanks, Steve. Kevin C. Berryman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jeff, just back to your question on the restructuring, I took a quick glance. And the restructuring, as you would imagine, is mostly Petroleum & Chemicals related, more than 50%. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thanks, Kevin. I appreciate all the questions and the time today. Look, I want to leave the call that we're excited about what we're talking about as it relates to the future. Jacobs is a strong company, a long history of delivering for our customers and our shareholders. Hopefully, you get a sense that we're implementing change to complement and support our existing strengths. And the things that we're talking about are capitalizing on our diversity, really continuing to leverage off of our client relationship focus, and deploy capital and cash in a smart way. We're focused on winning more business. I believe there's good momentum in a tough market. I hope you get a sense we're driving stronger, deeper accountability, and we're also trying to achieve world-class standards in our most important product, which is our project delivery. And our value proposition has always been a key differentiator at Jacobs, and the global team is really driving forward to get Jacobs back on track to grow profitability. And we look forward to continuing to talk about this over the next several quarters. So thanks for your time and have a great rest of the day. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Jacobs Engineering third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Berryman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Gary, and good morning and good afternoon to all. We welcome everyone to Jacobs' 2016 third quarter earnings call. I will be joined on the call today by Steve Demetriou, our Chairman and CEO. As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation to our website. We will reference this slide presentation in our prepared remarks. Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on slide 2. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on the current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain. And you should not place undue reliance on such statements, as actual results may differ materially. There are a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected, or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, Business; Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; as well as other filings with Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Please now turn to slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin our earnings presentation with some general comments on the business and our results for the last quarter, followed by a summary of market conditions for each of our four lines of business or LOBs. I will then provide some more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog, and results for our LOBs. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and our share buyback program. Steve will then discuss some next steps for the company and focus on the progress of our strategy development before finishing with some closing comments. After, we will then open it up for some questions. Before turning it over to Steve, I would like to highlight a recent change to our board of directors. And as announced a few weeks ago, Noel Watson retired from his role as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Jacobs board. Steve Demetriou, our CEO, was appointed to the additional role of Chairman. We are extremely thankful to Noel for his service and dedication to Jacobs over the years and are especially pleased he will continue to be a member of the board. With that, I will now pass it over to Chairman and CEO Steve Demetriou. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our fiscal year 2016 third quarter earnings call. Before I begin, I'd like to take the opportunity to personally thank Noel for his priceless guidance and support since my appointment as the Jacobs CEO in August of last year. As you all know, Noel led Jacobs to significant profitable growth while serving as CEO from 1992 to 2006 and has been an amazingly valuable member of the board since. I'm deeply honored to follow in his footsteps as Chairman. With Noel's continued support; with Linda Levinson, our longest-tenured independent board member being named Lead Director; and with our highly experienced and diverse set of directors, Jacobs is well-positioned to further the tradition of strong corporate governance. Slide 4 is a summary of our fiscal year third quarter business performance. During the third quarter global economic conditions posed continued challenges in certain end markets. Specifically, weak commodity prices such as crude oil, copper, and iron ore have negatively impacted our oil and gas and mining sectors. Against this backdrop, we're pleased to report that our backlog at quarter-end was $18.3 billion, up modestly versus last quarter. It is also very encouraging to see how our global business teams are successfully executing on our new strategic focus to upgrade our sales mix. Although third quarter revenue of $2.7 billion trended slightly down, this was more than offset by a significant increase in unit gross margin, which at 16.8% of revenue was the highest we have experienced since early 2015. As we purposely shift to a more profitable mix of clients and markets, I'm confident that we'll soon see the combined benefit of a growing top line that generates higher margins. We're also seeing the benefits of our increased focus on improving project delivery, not only in terms of quality and financial metrics, but based on an increasing trend in positive client feedback. Also in the third quarter, we continued to successfully right-size Jacobs and relentlessly drive out costs across the company, resulting in a significant reduction of $102 million in G&A year to date versus 2015. All in all, third quarter earnings came in at $0.78 per share, flat versus a year ago when excluding a one-time discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. I'm also very pleased with the improved working capital and cash flow performance. Year-over-year operating working capital was down $192 million, and DSO decreased 10 days versus last year. This capital efficiency was a key contributor to a strengthening of our already solid balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvement as our heightened focus on working capital delivers additional cash benefits. Moving to slide 5, and as we announced earlier this year, we're now managing the company by four global lines of business, or LOBs. The chart on this slide shows the breakout of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each LOB, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOBs, but here we provide insight into the differing economics of each business as it relates to the mix of profitability versus the top line. In summary, the strength of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure, and certain higher-value Industrial businesses demonstrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and why we're able to maintain profit stability during a period of very challenging macroeconomic pressures. Specifically, during the third quarter, we were able to see segment operating profit growth in three of our four lines of business versus a year ago. Of these, our Industrial LOB showed the most improvement in segment operating profit, up 32% versus last year's third quarter, followed by Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology, up 21% and 16%, respectively. These improvements more than offset the challenges we faced in Petroleum & Chemicals, which was down 29% versus the year-ago quarter. Overall, segment operating profit for the company was up 7% versus the year-ago quarter when excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Although we're not satisfied with Jacobs' bottom line results, we're pleased with the improvement in segment operating profit margins versus last year, a good indication of our efforts to drive a culture of greater accountability to achieve more profitable and higher-margin work. Progressing to slide 6, a summary of our Aerospace & Technology LOB, which continues to be a bright spot for Jacobs. This business covers a variety of clients and government agencies that range from NASA to the Department of Defense, U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and also the intelligence community. Backlog for the LOB grew by more than $200 million since last quarter and now stands at $5.1 billion. Importantly, the higher-margin professional services portion of this backlog increased over $300 million with a favorable margin opportunity. In the near term, the customer programs we're supporting continue to receive stable funding, and we expect that to continue in most of our key markets and geographies for the foreseeable future. This is somewhat mitigated by the ongoing trend toward small-business set-asides, which we'll need to continue to work towards offsetting in our drive for (9:31) profitable growth. As we have previously discussed, in this LOB we're experiencing extended procurement cycles and award protests in our U.S. government services markets. However, the $250 million awarded but not in backlog mentioned last quarter has been reduced to $140 million on the strength of several previous wins that have finally cleared the protest process. Additionally, in the U.S., we have won all of our major rebids awarded this fiscal year, and aerospace and defense remains healthy. Looking forward we have a solid pipeline of new business opportunities and have targeted over $3 billion in total contract lifecycle revenue prospects closing in the next 18 months. Last quarter we announced the acquisition of Van Dyke Technology, which expanded our intelligence community and cyber-security capabilities. We're targeting this strategic investment to drive additional growth, and we expect the homeland security, cyber, and intelligence related markets to remain strong for the foreseeable future. In addition to our traditional government clients, we're building momentum via collaboration with other Jacobs lines of business and are looking at opportunities to bring our IT and cyber capabilities to bear with our commercial sector customers. While the quarter was positive for our U.S.-based work, the recent Brexit vote is creating some uncertainty, specifically in the U.K. nuclear build sector. As previously discussed, we have already been awarded a major framework contract with the Hinkley Point C nuclear project, and we were pleased with the recent EDF board final approval. The U.K. government has indicated they will make their decision in the fall. All indications are that all three nuclear build programs in the U.K. will continue forward, even in light of the Brexit vote. We'll continue to closely monitor this. And the environmental sector is producing a solid pipeline for our Aerospace & Technology LOB. We're successfully maintaining our work with the U.S. government while expanding into the commercial sector, including a framework agreement we signed with one of Jacobs' major traditional customers in the Petroleum & Chemicals LOB. Turning to slide 7, our Buildings & Infrastructure LOB was steady overall, with backlog largely flat at $4.8 billion versus last quarter and last year. We're experiencing growth in the healthcare industry, driven by the dynamics of an aging population. In the corporate building sector, we remain focused on a select base of high-quality opportunities where we can leverage client relationships and synergies across four global lines of business. Our mission-critical services continues to grow and develop globally where there's an increased need for data systems and storage. We're continuing to work on projects with city-wide strategies, and we're assisting the drive toward smart cities. We're active on several of these projects across the globe, and expect significant opportunities for Jacobs as the Internet of Things drives interconnectivity across city-wide systems. In infrastructure, there's been an uptick in government rail spending, and several high-speed and light-rail projects are moving forward in the U.S. Our 2015 acquisition of J.L. Patterson & Associates is supporting our efforts, particularly on the West Coast. The U.S. Highway Bill has provided increased spending confidence, with most notable opportunities in areas where regional transportation packages exist, such as Florida, Texas, and California. In the U.K., increased government investment in infrastructure to drive economic development has been a positive, although the Brexit vote may impact this in the mid-term. For the moment, most U.K. clients are saying it's business as usual, but we will continue to monitor the situation closely. In Australia, the federal and state governments are making strong investments in transportation, and we've had a number of positive highway and rail wins this year. Global aviation opportunities are growing, driven by aging airports, growth in passenger travel, and increased spending programs. In the U.S. alone, projections are for more than $130 billion in investment over the next 10 years. To this end, we recently announced the strategic expansion of our global aviation practice, hiring several key individuals and appointing a Global Aviation Business Leader. We're excited about our recent win to support the $8 billion LaGuardia Airport redevelopment program. We're also in the midst of several large-scale aviation pursuits globally. We're also seeing investments in water-related infrastructure in the Middle East, and there are major opportunities across Asia Pacific. The environmental market continues to grow globally as clients look to reduce costs through energy savings and increase sustainability practices. And we're seeing opportunities in Asia for power generation, specifically in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Finally, I'd like to mention that in June, Phil Stassi, who was most recently President of the Buildings & Infrastructure line of business, elected to retire after nearly 40 years with Jacobs. I'd like to take a moment to thank Phil for his leadership and significant contributions to Jacobs over his extensive career with the company, and for all he did to help me in my first year at Jacobs. I'd also like to welcome Bob Pragada into his expanded role as President of the Buildings & Infrastructure LOB, and I'm excited about the strong leadership, experience, and strategic insight he will bring to the organization. Moving to slide 8, our Industrial LOB backlog is at $3.2 billion. This is relatively flat compared to last quarter, but up more than $500 million compared to last year, on the strength of our life science business and our recently announced EPCM contract to support Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi underground copper project in Mongolia. The mining and minerals sector continues to be significantly challenged, as commodity prices remain under pressure, and most client projects are continuing to stall. A few potential large investments in the mining space are being broken up and parceled in order spread out and conserve capital spending. However, as previously mentioned, we were successful in securing one of the only major projects in this industry. This was an exciting win and will have a positive effect on our Industrial LOB as we move into 2017. There continues to be a robust pipeline of work in our life sciences sector, primarily driven by regulatory approvals for next-generation therapies. Recent trends indicate significant future investment in both R&D facilities and manufacturing capacity, with geographic focus in Europe, Ireland, and the U.S. There's a growing pipeline of new drug initiatives, and the need for greater capacity is being accelerated as a result of several clients receiving regulatory approvals. Though we are the clear market leader in the biopharmaceutical space, we continue to grow market share through a strategic focus on sustaining capital opportunities, integrated project delivery, and geographic expansion. We expect longer-term success from several of our early-phase design efforts on programs currently scheduled for next wave manufacturing capacity expansions. Within our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, our Chemetics business is benefiting from our focus on sustaining capital programs, supporting the fertilizer and mining industries. We're also working with certain clients to expand our project delivery scope beyond the traditional licensing model in order to participate in full EPC projects. Demand for our Comprimo technology in the oil and gas markets is also increasing, with a recent uptick in project pursuits. Open paper (17:17) activity continues to be brisk, both in the U.S. as well as in emerging economies such as Russia, Brazil, and Indonesia. And although our backlog in field services has been relatively flat over the last several quarters, we're positive on the market outlook and the opportunities to grow. Specifically, our petrochemical customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast and our nuclear and defense clients in the U.K. have accelerated solicitations for integrated EPC programs to be executed in the 2017 and 2018 timeframe. Additionally, we have seen increase in opportunities as our customers look to drive down operating costs through supplier consolidation and productivity improvements. We're putting particular emphasis in the U.S. Gulf region, and we recently announced an expansion of our presence there, including a commitment to increased workforce training and development to meet our customers' needs. And on slide 9, the summary of our global Petroleum & Chemicals line of business. Weak global oil prices continue to negatively impact this LOB. After peaking in June at over $50, oil prices have been steadily declining, and weakness is projected to continue through the second half of 2016. As a result, capital spending across the petroleum sector continues to be down significantly, with certain U.S. clients reducing their spend by more than 50% versus last year. With this backdrop, I'm very pleased that we've been able to stabilize and maintain our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog above $5 billion, as we successfully focus on the downstream side of the industry, where we see attractive opportunities. The upstream oil and gas sector is under the most severe pressure. Saudi Arabia and other national oil companies have kept with their decision to maintain market share. Consequently, oil production in the Middle East continues to rise. Our strong position in this region, especially in Saudi Arabia, has enabled us to selectively participate where capital is being spent. However, margins are under significant pressure due to heavy competition. Outside the Middle East, high-cost producers are being squeezed, especially in the U.S. One of the only positive trends in this sector is the increased production of shale oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids. Process and pipeline infrastructure need to be put in place to move these barrels to market. And this will be an area of continued focus for Jacobs. It should be noted that the upstream sector now represents less than 10% of our total Petroleum & Chemicals backlog, so the downside risk going forward is minimal. Our refining business remains a positive, especially in maintenance, turnaround, and sustaining capital projects. There's an increased focus on process safety and compliance. As a result of our J-Pro (20:05) service, in which we offer our clients world-class process safety management, we're well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. We're also seeing excellent opportunities as customers focus on octane improvement projects and butane disposition, which favors alkylation, a particular strength of ours. Refining demand in developing countries is expected to increase at more than 3% annually. We continue to see requests for feasibility and FEED studies in developing countries in Asia and Africa, and we're looking beyond our traditional markets. We're expecting grassroots refining opportunities in India and South Asia, as both regions continue to develop. The chemicals market continues to provide significant opportunities for Jacobs, and new sales bookings are up sequentially this year. We're seeing opportunities in propylene and ethylene derivatives, primarily on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, crude oil to chemicals projects are seeing a heightened interest, particularly in the Middle East. Additionally, there's increased interest in diversification into value-added products, with a move away from first-line commodity chemicals that are impacted by crude oil pricing trends. There's also good activity in energy efficiency and yield improvement projects. Ethane, LPG, and naphtha feedstocks are plentiful and relatively cheap and may provide the economic incentives for project development. Overall, I'm particularly pleased with how the global Petroleum & Chemicals team has extended beyond our traditional customer base. The team is also expanding geographically and is building up the capability to selectively pursue and win fully integrated EPC opportunities. I'll now pass it back to Kevin to present more details on our financial results. Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Steve. So I'm now turning to slide 10, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. As we have communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the third quarter was $2.7 billion, which is down approximately 7% versus our third quarter last year. However, more positively, as Steve mentioned, our backlog stands at $18.3 billion, which is up sequentially versus last quarter. And we'll make a few more comments our backlog a little bit later in the presentation. In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing-12-month basis was just under 1, at 0.96, which also extends the positive sequential improvement seen last quarter. Meanwhile, our gross margin dollars for the quarter were $451 million, resulting in the highest absolute level in a quarter this year, continuing a positive sequential trend seen over the course of our 2016 fiscal year. The gross margin percentage also improved during the quarter to 16.8%, up 84 basis point sequentially and plus 10 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business was also up sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter as well. It was also the highest since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. This is evidence of the increased focus of our teams to improve project execution. The benefits from our restructuring also continued to positively impact and contribute to the bottom line during the quarter, resulting in further reductions in G&A versus the year-ago period. Specifically, G&A was lower by $32 million versus the year-ago quarter and by $102 million on a year-to-date basis. Both are clear indications of our success in right-sizing the company and improving financial performance. As a result, our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $142 million, our highest level in fiscal year 2016, and nearly flat versus the year-ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.78. The $0.78 figure is flat to last year's EPS figure when excluding the discrete tax benefit of $0.19 that was included in the year-ago quarter figure. Finally, as Steve also talked to, traction has been growing in our efforts to improve accounts receivable. The company's DSO levels reduced by 10 days versus the prior-year quarter. While we still have further opportunities to reduce this, the improvement in accounts receivable has helped support a reduction in operating working capital, down to $515 million, which is down $82 million sequentially versus last quarter and $192 million from the year-ago quarter. Operating working capital as percent of the trailing-12-month has a result decreased 130 basis points versus the same calculation a year ago, down to 4.5% of revenues from 5.8% last year. Free cash flow was obviously therefore strong, totaling $164 million during the quarter. The company's net cash position ended at $128 million, up $101 million from the $27 million figure last quarter and up $259 million from the year-ago quarter. So I'm moving on now to slide 11, and you'll see our total backlog stands at the combined $8.3 billion previously referenced, which is slightly up from our Q2 figure, a positive given the tough market conditions our sales teams continue to face in certain end markets. Of note, the $18.3 billion figure includes a negative foreign currency exchange impact of $200 million versus our Q2 figure. Excluding the impact of these FX movements, our backlog actually grew sequentially by $300 million. Versus the year-ago figures, our backlog is down $500 million from the $18.8 billion year-ago figure to $18.3 billion. Again, a large portion of this reduction is also driven by foreign exchange movements. When adjusting for differences in foreign exchange versus the year-ago figure, our backlog on a constant currency basis would have been $18.7 billion, only slightly down versus the year-ago quarter. We're pleased with this performance with general stability in backlog across the portfolio versus last quarter. Even with the end market challenges facing our Petroleum & Chemicals business, the backlog for this LOB was relatively flat on a sequential basis. Our Aerospace & Technology business, which we believe continues to provide good growth opportunities, increased by the $200 million referenced by Steve earlier. Finally, our higher-margin professional services backlog actually grew by $500 million sequentially versus the last quarter and now represent $11.9 billion of total backlog. The remaining $6.4 billion represents our field services work and is sequentially down $400 million. The growth in professional services bodes well for momentum as a business going forward. So, turning to slide 12, I'd like to talk a little bit about our Q3 adjusted segment financials for our four lines of business. As you can see, three of the four LOBs improved their adjusted segment operating profit and profit margin in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see some revenue decline versus the year-ago period, the adjusted segment operating profit increased by 16% and is now up 5% for the nine months year to date. Segment operating profit margins also improved 8% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. Improvement in the margin profile is driven both by strong performance fees realized in this year and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of the business. Reduced performance fees in the short term could put some incremental pressure on sequential margins going forward. The B&I business also saw revenue decline for the quarter versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit improved by 21% and is up 9% for the nine months year to date. As a result, segment operating profit margins were exceptionally strong in this quarter, 9.1%, up 210 basis points versus the year-ago period. For the year-to-date figure, segment operating profit margin performance was also solid at 7.8%, up 110 basis points versus the last fiscal year period. Despite pressures in the mining industry, revenue for the Industrial of line of business increased 12% versus the year-ago quarter and led to a 32% increase in segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Segment operating profit margin for the quarter was also up and had 4% growth and 60 basis point (29:00) improvement from the year-ago period. Growth in our life sciences business is driving the overall growth picture for this LOB. The improved margin this quarter from last is due to the elimination of the discrete items we discussed last quarter, and our reported margin profile that we are showing this quarter is very much aligned with our expectations. Lastly, our P&C line of business, Petroleum & Chemicals line of business, continued to face end market challenges, as evidenced by the lower segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Although the P&C segment operating profit margin for the quarter is down 40 basis points versus year-ago, importantly, it is up 30 basis points from last quarter, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost reductions in the line of business and the benefits of the restructuring. Finally, our unallocated costs for the quarter remain aligned with our costs in the previous two quarters and represent a mix of cost elements, some of which are inherently predictable and some that are not. Note, just to continue the education process in terms of what we do have in these figures, these costs include acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of intangible assets; adjustments to employee fringe benefit programs, which include medical pensions and other employee benefits; certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures; and margin adjustments on projects that are not related to LOB performance. Consistent with the first two quarters of the year, unallocated corporate costs totaled $19.5 million and were up year over year due to increased legal defense costs, fringe rate true-ups, and expenses relating to our strategy work. In summary, the fact that three of our four LOBs are up year over year is a clear indication of the benefits of our diversity and our ability to deliver solid operating profit performance in a challenging environment. So, turning to slide 13, a quick update on our restructuring, where we continue to be successful in reducing costs. Certainly this is evidenced by the magnitude of our G&A reduction over the last few months. The restructuring effort to reduce our fixed-cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate, is nearing completion, and our forecasts remain in place. The total cost of our restructuring effort is expected in the $330 million to $350 million range through the fiscal year-end, with the expected gross savings $240 million to $270 million. Please note, these figures include the most recent step we took to exit our French operations. As previously mentioned, some portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business to ensure we position ourselves for profitable growth in the long term. In summary, our actions are helping Jacobs to increase profitability in a challenged economic environment, and we look forward to seeing continued benefits going forward. Moving to slide 14 to provide a short update on our share buyback program. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our share buyback program in a balanced and steady manner. In Q3 we spent $30 million to repurchase 600,000 shares. Year to date we have now spent a total of $102 million in share buybacks, and we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million of share buyback authorization in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the original three-year program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review, and our plan is to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure and in our strategy review day later this year. With that, let me hand it back over to Steve. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kevin. Turning to slide 15, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes discussing our continued focus on project delivery excellence; upgrading of company systems, tools, and procedures; and the development of our corporate strategy. We continue to focus on several initiatives to drive project delivery excellence, and I'm pleased with the progress as reflected in our margin improvements. Project write-downs continue to decrease versus a year ago, and use of our high-value India execution center is up 15% versus last year. We're implementing new project delivery standards across the four lines of business and developing upgraded and standardized tools to improve on project execution. One example this quarter was the signing of an enterprise agreement with a major software provider to implement a standardized project cost control system, which will provide our project teams with the ability to more effectively manage full-lifecycle project costs in a single platform, lowering our cost and increasing our multi-office execution capability. Also, we're in the final stages of implementing an upgraded enterprise business platform that will deliver powerful analytics across the business and to the operational leaders. This includes our financial systems, business intelligence, and analytics. By leveraging our scale, we'll be able to increase synergies to drive greater efficiency. While these changes involve a long-term transformation, many initiatives are underway and will be accelerated over the course of fiscal year 2017. As Kevin pointed, our companywide restructuring efforts have continued to deliver significant cost reductions as we focus on optimizing our office footprint. Most recently we announced the divestiture of our operations in France, which helped streamline our European business, and to refocus on higher-margin growth areas that provide the best returns for Jacobs and our shareholders. As discussed during our recent earnings calls, we believe that developing and executing a profitable global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry-leading shareholder value. We completed an initial review of our corporate strategy with our board in late July and have now moved in the phase of developing strategies for our four lines of business. To that end, we're finalizing plans for an Investor Day in late November. Moving to the last slide, and while we're pleased with our third quarter, we expect challenging market conditions for at least the remainder of this year. Global uncertainty, compounded by weak growth in developed markets, the Brexit vote, the U.S. federal election, and uncertain political environment in several countries, along with low commodity prices, continue to impact some of our end markets. More positively, we've begun to see a stabilization in our backlog, and we remain focused on driving improved margins. Our strategic review is progressing, and we're using early outcomes to adjust and refocus our business where we see the most promising growth. We'll continue to evaluate, modify, and refocus our portfolio for long-term sustainable shareholder value. In addition, the restructuring we've undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum, and our strategic review is identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our internal cost and expenses. We're seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts, and write-offs continue to be reduced. Finally, our performance year to date gives us an increased confidence that we will meet our objectives for the year, and we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.15. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Steve, Kevin, can you talk about, relative to the margin numbers that we're seeing this quarter by segment, where do you see the most upside as you continue to refine your business process, I guess, versus the segments where you're closer to your run rate target margins? And then, Kevin, obviously the corporate expense line item can move around quarter to quarter. Would you counsel us to think about the run rate we saw this quarter as a recurring item? Or any additional color on the litigation expense as part of that would be helpful. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Let me start on the margin question. And there's opportunity across all four lines of business, and the strategic review, where we initially focused on a deep dive of understanding the economics down to the office level and client level, has really revealed opportunities to strengthen margins across the company. So, of course there's certain sectors that are giving us more near-term opportunity, such as the Aerospace & Technology, certain Buildings & Infrastructure sectors. Obviously downstream chemicals in the Petroleum & Chemicals line of business, pharma, life sciences. But there isn't any single LOB or business unit inside of each of the LOBs that we're satisfied we're at trend line margin that we should be at. So I think there's going to be opportunity across the board. Kevin? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, Jerry, just very quickly on the \u2013 I think the remaining part of that question was relative to the corporate expenses, non-allocated corporate expenses. Look, we've been kind of trending pretty consistent over the first three quarters of the year. Typically fourth quarter is the lower figure because of the relative true-ups associated with various programs that we have. So I give you kind of that direction, that probably the number will probably be a little bit lower in Q4. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you. And then on the U.S. infrastructure opportunities, Steve, can you talk about how that's evolved over the course of the quarter? I guess there was some chatter about administrative delays, at least among the construction materials companies. And I'm wondering if the cadence of the project outlook for U.S. infrastructure or highway jobs has moved around at all as you look at the opportunity set, and how do you feel about the opportunity set in 2017? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, generally \u2013 again, where we play and the diversity of our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business, we really can't sit here and see any material delays that are impacting that business. We're obviously focused on certain sectors that we believe are moving faster. I mentioned aviation is \u2013 we're pretty bullish on, not only in the U.S., but being able to translate some of that capability across the globe, especially in the Middle East and Asia, some opportunities there. And so I think, for us, what we really need to do is continue to strategically narrow in on where we can drive growth, and we believe that growth should come soon from the Buildings & Infrastructure, and pivot to a more steady growth, rather than where we've been most recently is a flat backlog. So that's going to be our goal as we move into fiscal year 2017. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Can you hear me? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Jamie, good morning. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. I guess two questions. Kevin, I appreciate you guys narrowed your guidance range \u2013 still seems pretty wide, I guess, given we have one quarter left. But your guide does imply, I think, for the fourth quarter you'll be at, I don't know, $0.73, $0.74 versus the Street's at $0.81. And it would imply sequentially we're down, which surprises me, just given the progress you guys have made on the margin side and the fact that backlog is holding okay. So is there anything unusual in the fourth quarter? Because obviously that has implications for how people are thinking about 2017 and the sustainability of the cost savings that you guys are generating. And then my second question, on a positive, relates to the DSOs, where you saw a pretty nice improvement sequentially. So, again, is there anything unusual in that? Is this a sustainable sort of DSO number? Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, a couple comments. Thanks for the question, Jamie. The first one as it relates to the sequential commentary relative to what our guidance is. Look, the guidance is \u2013 we feel it's an appropriate level. We've narrowed it a bit. There still is volatility out in the space out there, as you know, about it as it relates to certainly the Petroleum & Chemical side of the business, as well as just the general economic situation and some unease relative to elections and implications and so on and so forth. So we just thought it appropriate to do so. Regardless of that, though, your comment as it relates to the sequential piece is \u2013 two comments I would make. The first is that typically, this last quarter is a quarter that is generally impacted by a lower level of kind of billings because of the holiday periods in Europe, in the U.S., and so on and so forth. So that's a general comment. So effectively, sequentially, we tend to open that we'd be (42:37) down versus the third quarter. I think that's kind of a normal kind of dynamic over the course of the year, fourth quarter versus the first three. The other point certainly is that, as we think about going forward, we're continuing to invest back against some of the savings. You heard about the aviation spend and some of the investments in support there. So, as it relates to the savings initiatives, certainly take into account the fact that there will be some investments that will help offset some of those savings opportunities. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And, Kevin, can you quantify the level of investment in the fourth quarter, just so we know what's implied and how we think about that as sort of run rate for next year? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Look, versus year-ago, certainly we're going to be higher in terms of our investments in certain employee costs Q4 over Q4, so that's \u2013 if you see some of the numbers relative to the change versus year-ago, employee costs are going to be higher in the fourth quarter versus year-ago as we true up all of the final costs associated with our various programs in Q4. So won't talk about specifics, but we're going to provide a little bit better idea when we finalize our strategy and the go-forward as it relates to what our investment opportunities are, what they will be relative to the savings, so you get a good perspective on what the run rates will be going forward. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then, sorry, the DSO improvement? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Look, DSO \u2013 we've talked about \u2013 thanks for the reminder. We've talked about there being really good progress being made in terms of activity levels over the first three quarters of the year, although we haven't seen very good progress in actually the financial numbers. This quarter we really saw the traction start to gain, and we fundamentally believe that we have more work to be done and that there are additional opportunities. So we're continuing to drive that going forward, and we expect that there will be incremental opportunities going forward versus specifically the accounts receivable figures that we have reported this quarter. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. But is this a sustainable number or no, on a relative basis? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I would hope that we'll be able to do a better job going forward. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, all right. Thank you; I'll get back in queue. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks; good morning. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Steve. Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Morning. Your sales upgrades, cost reductions, and buybacks are helping keep EPS flat in a lower revenue environment. I know you just talked about some of the investments you're making in the fourth quarter, but as we kind of move forward here, what's your confidence that we could start to see that year-over-year EPS start to accelerate? And do you think you actually need backlog growth in order to get EPS growing at kind of a double-digit pace? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, let me just start by saying where we have the most confidence is improving our fundamentals of delivering projects and becoming even more efficient in both our cost and capital that Kevin was talking about. And so we believe in all of that we've got significant opportunity over the next several years and would expect to drive another improvement in being able to optimize cost, improve margins as we go into 2017. And as it relates to the backlog and growth side, obviously that's where we want to start pivoting. And certain end markets and certain LOBs are going to have more of an opportunity to do that than others based on the external dynamics. But as we continue to drive internal improvements on our project delivery, we are putting pressure on ourselves to start turning the backlog up at some point in the near future. Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Maybe to pin you down a little more if I can. But, I mean, should we be thinking that EPS growth is in the cards going forward from here, not sort of a flat to down a little? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well, ultimately, our strategy isn't about long-term flat EPS. So clearly the expectation as we pivot to growth, as Steve highlighted, we're going to be pivoting off of a stronger foundation of margin, and ultimately that would relate to incremental growth in terms of earnings that we'll ultimately be able to realize. Having said all of that, Steve's point about continuing to focus on delivering better margin for what we got today is continuing to take place. We expect that there are some additional benefits there, but for us ultimately to get the kind of earnings per share that we're looking for longer term, i.e., profitable growth, we got to see some growth. And we're looking to pivot to do that. And it's in the hopefully relatively near future. Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : That makes sense. Just in terms of Motiva, the arbitration is supposed to get underway in September. In your new disclosures you now say it could have a material effect but based on the information you have, you don't think it will have a material effect. Is there just any way for investors to get comfortable that the impact is not going to be material? Just trying to figure out how to think about it here as it gets underway in December (48:20). Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, look. You have the disclosure in front of you. It is how we very much feel about the situation on this particular item. And we continue to feel very positive as it relates to what our position is and how our discussions are going. So I think that I'll probably leave it there, and we fundamentally believe that the disclosure is an appropriate description of our situation and what we believe will happen. Steven M. Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): (49:05) Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): (49:07) Steve, let me try and pin you down a little bit more on backlog in the sense that it sequentially rose in the Q (49:14) despite $200 million of FX translation. You talked about expecting stability in the Q (49:19), but the results seem at least modestly better than stable in a difficult environment. Can you grow sequential backlog in this environment? If so, how much of the growth is self-help driven, given your initiatives, such as \u2013 you've been expanding the aviation field services businesses. (49:34) I know you just announced these things, but this has been part of your \u2013 as you guys came in, Steve, last year you talked about governing the aviation (49:45) business in particular? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Andrew, it's real difficult to hear you, and I know you're asking about backlog and our ability to grow it. But we couldn't catch you everything you were saying because it didn't come in clear. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, so let me just rephrase this real quickly. You've grown sequential backlog, but you've talked about stability for this quarter, and you grew it despite FX translation (50:14). So what I'm trying to figure out is how much of the growth is sort of your own initiatives in a pretty difficult environment. You've talked for a year now about expanding your aviation business, and I know you're adding more resources to it. But this has been a while now of focusing on these initiatives. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so let's just talk about backlog for a few minutes and where we've transitioned from, say, a few years ago to today. As we look at our mix of businesses and what's happened in the marketplace, we've been faced with a significantly declining backlog over the last couple years in some of the heavy-hit commodity areas like mining and like upstream oil and gas. And the good news from our backlog standpoint is sort of all that decline now is essentially behind us because other than the new Rio Tinto project and some of our sustaining capital et cetera, we really don't have much in the backlog as it relates to those heavy hard-hit areas. And what we've done is been transitioning to expand our customer base away from \u2013 in addition to the traditional customers we've had. And as we do that, that takes time to replenish and start building backlog in some of those growth areas. As I look at our lines of business, we should be able to soon grow backlog in Buildings & Infrastructure. It's an area that provides us growth. We have strong positions. We're very well diversified. We're not happy that our backlog has been flat. We should be able to do better. When we look at the downstream chemical side, we believe that over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, you're going to see more and more of our Jacobs Petroleum & Chemicals backlog become that sector. And we think there's significant opportunities there. Obviously Aerospace & Technology, as we are gaining success now in rebids and shifting to some new areas, especially in the U.S., we expect at some point that that should put points on the board from a backlog standpoint. So we're excited and encouraged about our opportunity to grow. And we just need to start demonstrating that over the near term. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And I guess, Steve, is it fair to say that in the short to medium term, you could continue to grow sequential backlogs even with still difficult Petroleum & Chemicals markets? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I believe we have the opportunity to continue to put some modest growth on the board, and so we need to go out now and execute that. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Kevin, just shifting gears, this is the third quarter in a row that gross margin was up sequentially pretty significantly. It looks like mix is helping you a little as your lower-margin in Petroleum & Chemicals business is the weakest. But we know you're facing pricing pressures, so your initiatives to pursue higher-value margin work seems to be working. I asked you last quarter, but let me ask you again, is your backlog gross margin still higher than your revenue margin? And then how much more improvement can you get from cutting out sort of the underbid or loss-making type projects that you had if we go back a year ago? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Look, I think, Andy, couple comments are appropriate to make. It's very clear that as we think about how we want to drive our growth agenda going forward, we're not just thinking and talking about a top line figure. We're talking about top line that is profitable, and of course there's varying degrees as it relates to mix of business and dynamics that we have to take into account. But we're not just looking for growth for growth's sake. We want it to be profitable and result in incremental margin profile that is able to be realized. So, yes, there's certainly a mix benefit because of the dynamic you outlined. But when you look at the margin profile at each of the respective LOBs, you see a consistent theme where margins by the LOBs are also improving regardless of what percentage they make up of the total business. So I think that that is indicative of the focus that ultimately we're trying to drive, and which I think the LOB are doing a great job on, is \u2013 look, it's about a profitable growth agenda that ultimately we're going to have to drive, which is the foundation of being able to drive incremental EPS longer term. And of course combined with our focus on the working capital side it ends up being capital-efficient growth as well. So I think you can see that there is both sides of the coin which are helping us. One is the mix is, in itself, good \u2013 overall mix \u2013 but if you look by LOBs we're also seeing improvements. So I think that bodes well for your comment about, are we seeing some benefits? And I think that intensely competitive environment in which we are, we hope to be able to improve that, and longer term that certainly is something that we'll be pushing for. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. So margin in the LOBs is still higher in backlog than revenue. Is that fair, Kevin? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well, look, as you \u2013 I'd have to go back (55:42) to yes, in general yes. But look at the results so far, too. We are seeing that the margin profile is looking good by each of the LOBs, and there's actual sequential improvement that's occurring. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Hey, guys, I guess I wanted to just understand a little bit more about some of the reinvestments that you alluded to that could be coming in the future. So I guess, as you look, Kevin, as we head into 2017 in a flat revenue environment, do you expect that the SG&A line would be flat or down or is it up? In other words, how do the SG&A margins move from here on kind of a year-over-year basis? Do the reinvestments take up all of the savings, part of the savings, more than the savings? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well, a couple points. First is the one that if you look at our G&A over the course of the year, we're down $102 million versus year-ago in the first three quarters of the year. And some of that is netted against some of the incremental investments that we're already making. So clearly there's a net benefit, which is clear relative to the lower G&A figures. We expect that we should be able to continue to realize these benefits. Of course, over time, we're going to have to invest in merits, we're going to have to invest in training and development of our people, and so there will be some offsets of that. The idea, though, of our strategy is not for when we get back to growth that our SG&A and our G&A figures are going to go up correspondingly with our growth in the gross margin dollars. That's what it's all about. It's about having the discipline when we start to see those gross \u2013 that you get the growth leverage, a better growth leverage relative to those incremental dollars. So I think of G&A more as fixed in that we always got to try and figure out how to keep those numbers consistent and certainly growing less over the long haul with the gross margin growth so you get the incremental leverage. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Two more quick follow-ups on the margin line. One is, referring to the fact that you guys have talked about that there could be more adjustments in the company, restructuring that could be happening, maybe like you call it a next wave. Can you give us an idea of how developed those are here today, and what we could be expecting from them? And then maybe just a more simple question, which would be, what are the trends you're seeing in like-for-like type business? Are you seeing steady margins, improvements, or decline? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so I think what you're going to hear us talk more about going forward is shifting from what we called our restructuring initiative to productivity, efficiency, just a fundamental of improving our main product and that is executing projects. And so, yes, we do believe we have a rich pipeline of opportunities. The strategic review's revealing that. We think we can continue to optimize our footprint in a way that can facilitate growth, and at a much more efficient basis. When we compare what we start off and committing to with regard to projects and the margin that we should be getting, that's agreed in our contracts, and ultimately what we get at the end of the project, we've got significant opportunity to do better. And so with that all said, that should lead to margin improvement across all of our four lines of businesses as we pursue that. And so we have not completed, by all means, our cost initiatives, but we'd like to be moving from a restructuring basis to strategic improvement. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. On like-for-like margins, are there any markets that are showing positive trends or correspondingly negative trends in other markets where there's material movement in margin trends as bid? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, look, we've called out that there's a couple areas where certainly the market is facing some pressure, obviously in Petroleum & Chemicals. That's one area. And mining, where those opportunities are challenging in terms of the margin profile. And of course we called out, in our prepared remarks, some of the dynamics in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia. So, yeah, there are areas where we're facing some pressure. I guess what I will come back to is again, we're seeing, as it relates to our margin profile, improving. And we've seen that over the course of this 2016 fiscal year, where we're seeing continued sequential improvement. So I think in general, those positives are offsetting some of the market conditions that we're seeing overall. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi, folks. Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a couple of end market questions for you. Number one, yourselves and your peers started talking a lot about smart Internet-oriented buildout going forward. Can you talk a little more about how material that opportunity could be for you from a two- to three-year perspective? Do you need to partner with some tech firms to do that? And the second question is really on the space side. I know you're pretty big with NASA. We've started to see pretty fast growth in capital allocation to some of the commercial private space programs, too. If you could talk about the opportunity there. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I'll work backwards and start with your second question. We feel good in our position of where things are being funded. NASA and intelligence community agencies appear to be well-funded. So the business that we're in around energy, defense, space, and intelligence, we see a good, steady, ongoing funding situation, and our clients are telling us that. And so we just need to maintain our excellence in winning those projects and continuing forward. As it relates to the first question, Tahira, could you just recap the first part of your question again, so I make sure I answer it correctly? Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Sure, Steve, in your prepared commentary, you talked a little about the Internet of Things and how that's started to trickle into the sector. How meaningful could that be for you from a two- to three-year perspective? Largely more so because I haven't heard you talk about that that much before? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Right. Look, we're going to be able to talk a lot more in November, and we're excited in what we're leading up to around that. And I think what you are going to hear is that that segment and Internet of Things, IT, cyber, mission-critical, those elements of our portfolio, are going to be an important part of our strategy going forward. And we think we have capabilities internally already with the Van Dyke initiative with our capabilities that we have in Australia and U.K. and U.S. specifically. We see smart cities being developed all over the world, including the Middle East, and we're engaged in initiatives there. And as we make final decisions on where we're going to put M&A capital potentially in the future, potentially that could lead to some thematic acquisition opportunities that expand our capability in what we believe will be a growing market. So, how significant, all that, we'll talk more about that in November. But I think you'll continue to hear that as part of several growth opportunities that we're going to be pursuing over the long term. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, okay. Thank you, Steve. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. (1:04:28) Operator : The next question comes from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Hi, good morning. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Morning. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Morning. A couple of just follow-ups. Kevin, maybe first for you, in terms of the cost savings on the restructuring, the $240 million to $270 million, how much are you realizing now and how much is incremental in 2017? I guess, and how much do you expect to have to share with customers? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well, if you look at the run rate that we have so far this year, let's just take the absolute level of reduction in G&A year over year. We talked about $100 million plus, right, $102 million over the first three quarters of the year. We've already talked about there having been savings of $50 million last year. So we're cumulatively on top of that figure. So we're kind of, at a minimum, at $150 million with a little bit more to go, since we're continuing to spend against our efforts. So I think the bulk of these benefits we are realizing, and we're coming to be able to realize the vast bulk of it over the course of 2016, and there will be a small piece that goes into 2017, which will help further mitigate against any potential increases in salaries or whatever that we may want to consider in 2017. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And then, just in terms of the strategic or the strategy update that you'll be talking about in November. The schedule for talking about it is pushed out a little bit. And I'm just wondering, have the options changed significantly? I know you don't want to get into it now, but the range of possibilities or what you're looking at, any more color there? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't read into anything around the timing. We had thought about, as we completed the overlay strategy, if you will, of our corporate strategy that we would come out and talk about that earlier in the fall. But as we got into it and really got together as a leadership team and recognized that it isn't a one-size-fits-all, that we have four lines of business, that we are better off progressing each of the business strategies at which we're now have entered that phase, and be able to come out and talk about not only where we're going as a whole company, but how that gets translated into each of our lines of business. And so that was the ultimate decision of let's do it in November where we'll be ready to do all that. John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, within the Buildings & Infrastructure segment, one of your competitors talked about getting to the point where they have more projects than they can bid on. Are you seeing this as well? And how would that translate into pricing for you and how to contemplate margins for that segment? Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Look, I started some of the backlog discussion over some of the other questions earlier today, saying that I believe there's great opportunity across the globe in Buildings & Infrastructure, and we're extremely diverse. And, yes, there are a rich set of opportunities, but there's also a strong competitive base. And so what we're all about is high-value project opportunities. Not going after things just for the sake of billable hours or revenue. But actually where we can get good, sustainable, high-value growth. And that's what we're focused on. And we believe those opportunities are there, and what we are finding that our clients want, in addition to good economics, is they want quality suppliers or B&C companies. And what we're spending time is explaining to our clients some of the changes we've made and how we're getting more capable and more focused on win-win opportunities where we're creating value for them and where we're seeing better margins for ourself. And that's what you're going to hear more about as we go to 2017 as you hear about our plans and also from a strategic standpoint. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it, okay. And then just moving on to cash flow, how should we think about free cash flow in the last quarter of the year and kind of early thinking about 2017 with respect to the cash restructuring costs kind of shaking out? And then where do you think you can end up on, on the working capital front, given that you've made some pretty good progress there? Kevin C. Berryman - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So on the cash flow, Chad, certainly we talked about the working capital and that we do not believe we're done there, and we're looking to try \u2013 continued benefits there. I will say, just to quantify what our expectations are maybe a little bit more, we set established targets for each of our lines of business and for ourselves at the corporate level at the beginning of the year, and we're driving towards figures. And I will tell you that we're not necessarily all the way where we wanted to be in terms of our targets for the year. So that in itself should indicate that we're continuing to drive for incremental benefits beyond where we are today. So that's the first point. I do believe that there will be at some point in time, when we get to a more efficient cash structure supporting our business, that the incremental cash flow dynamics will not be at the magnitude that we've had this year obviously. The other dynamic that we certainly have to understand is that our business is not in a growth mode exactly right now, and there are implications on what cash flow dynamics occur during that particular period of time. So hopefully we'll have the high-class problem when that pivot occurs where we have profitable growth going forward, and then ultimately if we're at the capital efficient place that we would like to have, that will be translating into a good cash flow conversion going forward. But certainly the number for this quarter, for example, well above net income, is not a sustainable figure, but ultimately we certainly would like to think that we're going to be able to have a really good, solid conversion factor going forward. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Demetriou for any closing remarks. Steven J. Demetriou - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Look, thank you for participating today. We want to thank the investment community for listening to our quarterly call. We believe the actions we're undertaking continue to increase shareholder value, and we look forward to driving long-term sustainability of a stronger and healthier Jacobs. So have a great day. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Steve will begin our fourth quarter earnings presentation with some comments on the business and our results over the quarter and fiscal year, followed by a summary of market conditions for each of our four lines of business and backlog. I will then provide some more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics and results for each LOB. I will continue with some comments on our restructuring and our share buyback program, before Steve finishes with some closing comments. After, we will open it up for some questions. With that, I would now like to pass it over to our Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Before we move into the financials, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. Over the past year, while facing challenging conditions in several of our key end markets, we took the opportunity to implement a set of key improvement initiatives that significantly strengthened our foundation and positions us for success moving forward. The most important steps taken involved recognizing the four global lines of business, implementing a major restructuring to right size the company and become more cost efficient and developing a corporate strategy aimed at profitably growing Jacobs. While undertaking these initiatives, we also implemented a number of changes designed to increase accountability and transparency to drive greater financial discipline. In turn significantly optimizing cost and working capital allowing us to reinvest in Jacobs to upgrade our tools and processes to further strength the business and delivery of projects for our clients. Our efforts to transform the core is driving a renewed sense of urgency and energy across our company to deliver business improvements across the globe. While much has and continues to be done to positively change Jacobs, we\u2019re also cognizant of our very successful past. Since 1947, when Joe Jacobs founded our great company, Jacobs was headquartered in Pasadena, California, and enjoyed decades of impressive growth. In recent years, as we faced challenges to sustain growth, we recognized the need to transform our business and structure. One of the many steps identified was the new headquarters location. As such last month, we announced our relocation to Dallas, Texas, which fits with our plans to drive efficiency, attract top talent and achieve a more convenient access to best serve our clients. Moving to Slide 5 and a summary of our business performance, Kevin will cover more details regarding our solid fourth quarter in a minute, but on this slide, I would like to summarize our 2016 total year performance. For the year revenue was right at $11 billion and on adjusted basis earnings per share was $3.08, which is above the mid point of our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance range. As such, we\u2019re pleased we were able to consistently deliver for each quarter and for the full year against our internal expectations. During fiscal year 2016, we continue to see adverse market conditions across multiple lines of business, particularly in our petroleum and chemicals and mining markets. And these were major contributors to the year-over-year revenue decline in both the fourth quarter and total fiscal year. We also faced competitive pricing pressures and cyclical economic patterns in certain key markets, which negatively impacted our revenue mix. However as the year progressed, we started to build momentum due in part to our more focused global line of business structure and began to win more business as evident by the $438 million increase in our backlog at the end of our fourth quarter and the improved year-over-year margins generated in the second half of the year. I'm very pleased with how the entire Jacobs team has been relentless on improving various financial metrics as we saw a considerable improvement across multiple KPIs during the year. Specifically, the restructuring initiative drove down our global adjusted SG&A cost by more than 9%, reducing cost by $127 million. And our efforts to improve our working capital position resulted in a significant increase in operating cash flows in fact resulting in the largest ever annual free cash flow in the history of Jacobs. Just as positively, we also achieved our first year end net positive cash position since fiscal year 2013. Much of this was achieved through acute focus on our accounts receivables and improving our DSO, which decreased seven days versus prior year. Our focus on greater project delivery excellence also assisted in the improved margins we saw in the second half. Given our positive cash flow performance, we continued our efforts to return capital to our shareholders in the form of $153 million of purchases from our share buyback program. Moving to Slide 6, I'm extremely pleased with where our total backlog stands at the end of the fourth quarter, $18.8 billion, significant sequential increase of nearly $440 million versus the prior quarter. Our backlog is now less than 2% off of our previous record of $19.1 billion. Also noteworthy is that our current backlog includes $182 million, a negative foreign exchange movements when compared to the year ago figure. So, when adjusting for this, our backlog would, in fact, be up $137 million versus last year. Also positively, the professional services component of our backlog stood at $12 billion at fiscal year end, the highest since June of 2015, and a positive sign to support higher margins going forward. Overall, we're pleased with our sales performance under the tough macro conditions faced by several of our lines of business and the improvement in backlog across the portfolio is representative of our more disciplined approach and focus on leveraging synergies across the company to drive growth. Over the next four slides, I'll provide more specifics of each of our lines of business, but the key messages around our sales efforts going forward are as follows. Number one, we believe we're poised for further backlog growth as we move through 2017. Secondly, we're focused on adding higher value sales to backlog to drive long-term margin improvement. And we're holding ourselves accountable for this. We've added an annual management incentive measurement that will monitor our progress against profitably growing our backlog. Turning to Slide 7, the summary of our aerospace and technology line of business, where backlog remains steady at $5.1 billion versus last quarter, but higher by $230 million year-over-year. Program funding with our various customers remains generally stable and represents a large and diverse market, providing significant opportunity for market share growth. Defense spending in particular in the U.S., U.K. and Australia is expected to remain large and stable in the face of dynamic political circumstances including the U.S. presidential election and the recent Brexit vote in the U.K. As previously reported, we continue to have a number of awarded contracts with significant value not yet backlog due to competitor protests. In this line of business for the last 12 months to 18 months, we've been primarily focused on core client program rebids and have for the most part been very successful based on a strong track record of performance in our lean cost structure. I'm particularly pleased with the mix of business our aerospace and technology team has achieved both in terms of our successful rebids as well as recent high value new business wins. This is reflected in our operating margins as this business improved to 7.7% of revenue in fiscal year 2016 versus 7% in the prior year. We're now shifting focus to a strong new business pipeline of opportunities valued at over $20 billion, the largest we've ever experienced for this market. While protractive procurement timelines exacerbated by persistent protests are expected to continue. We believe significant organic growth potential exists in aerospace and technology. With regard to specific market sectors, homeland security, cyber and intelligence related industries remain strong areas of national priority spent. We continued to build momentum in bringing our services in these markets to other lines of business at Jacobs and have positive success engaging several commercial clients. In U.S. Environmental Services, our rebid win of the 10 year, $350 million remedial action contract for New Bedford Harbor with the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers further solidifies our base in this market. This coupled with a dominant position in places like Alaska where significant federal spend for environmental services provided foundation to expand into other government customer bases and geographies. At the same time, we continue to expand our business base with Jacobs traditional commercial sector customers, who have significant environmental related spend. In the UK, the nuclear decommissioning authority funding is projected to be steady around $20 billion over the next five years, a much of this funding will go to the Sellafield facility. Our nuclear cleanup group continues to support efforts here and with our strong delivery performance we are well positioned for much of the continuing work. Also in the U.K., the final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear new build project has been completed. The recent approval is obviously an important and positive milestone for the program and it's expected to have positive ramifications on the prospects of sanctioning approvals for the horizon and new gen nuclear newbuild programs as well. As previously reported, we've already been awarded a major framework for the Hinkley C program and we're supporting its development. All three nuclear build programs in the U.K. have expressed their intent to continue forward in light of the Brexit vote and these provide good opportunities for Jacobs. Moving to Slide 8. During the fourth quarter, we experienced positive momentum across the globe in buildings and infrastructure. For the first time in several quarters, our backlog increased by $190 million to $5.1 billion versus the third quarter and is also up $310 million versus this time last fiscal year. The general buildings market remains steady and we have successfully been growing our position as we continue to target bright spots in selective markets. We are seeing increased opportunities in the health care market specifically in the U.S. and New Zealand, which we\u2019ll be announcing shortly. Our market leadership position in the government building sector continues to grow with strategic wins at both the federal level with the U.S. Navy and the state level with customers such as the State of California and the City of Los Angeles. We continue to make great progress in this area and look forward to continuing this aspect of our business. The education sector represents one of our highest potential subsectors for growth with emerging opportunities in Asia Pacific, specifically in Australia and New Zealand and continued growth in the U.S. with several recent bond measures receiving approval in the Midwest and West Coast. We're also utilizing our knowledge base in the sector to enhance our value proposition for large scale Smart Cities emerging near Melbourne with the Australian Education City and also in Birmingham, England. Finally, we're happy to announce our selection as a platform partner for the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored 100 resilient cities program. The program is looking to drive remediation actions in member cities around the world faced with physical, social and economic challenges. On the infrastructure side, the global transportation market remains steady and we're using our strong position to capitalize on a number of opportunities. In aviation, specifically, we're leveraging our well established capabilities to target investments locally and abroad. Positively, we had recent wins at Denver International Airport for critical design build project, at Washington Dulles Airport for Phase II rail expansion and at LAX for terminal development work. We're also progressing several other international opportunities that we expect to announce soon. Within the U.S. highway sector, federal spending remains flat and most developments are being driven by regional design packages. Texas, Florida and California transport departments dominate the local spend and we're well positioned since these states are strong Jacobs markets. The Australian and U.K. markets continue to be buoyant and we're forecasting increased government and local authority investment. Some notable recent highway wins across the globe include the Darlington Upgrade project in Australia, a professional services contract for transport from Greater Manchester and a construction inspection service contract for the New Jersey Department of Transportation. The UK rail market also continues to see significant investment and we're providing PM/CM services on large metro project in the Middle East. In the U.S., we see opportunities across California, Seattle and the Northeast corridor. Australia is also a growth region as well as Asia. We had a number of exciting wins in the fourth quarter including UK Network Rail, the Level Crossing Removal Authority program in Melbourne and the LA County Purple Line extension. In the water market, we have a moderate position and are leveraging our expertise in the UK and Australia to grow our position globally. We've just completed two major projects in Australia and one several other projects including the United Utilities AMP6, Asset Management Program, in the U.K. and the St. Louis Sewer District watershed management design project in the U.S. I'm now on Slide 9 in the summary of our industrial line of business. In the fourth quarter, we saw a positive wins in several markets that offset much of the strong life science backlog bird. As a result, quarter end backlog remain near steady of $3.1 billion. While the mining and mineral sector remains weak, we are seeing some indications that eventual recovery may begin. In South America, specifically, investments totaling $49 billion are projected in Chile over the next ten years. And in Argentina, there's approximately $5 billion of projects expected to be announced by the end of 2018. Despite strong competition and sustaining capital work, we're also seeing more proposal activities for studies and evaluations, although this is in part driven by some of our competitors exiting the market. Positively, in the fourth quarter, we secured an engineering services contract for a treatment plant in South America. We won an underground study in Chile and we\u2019re awarded a position on a global engineering panel in Australasia, which puts us in a strong position to capture additional opportunities. The life science sector remains robust. Expansion continues in biologics and secondary manufacturing opportunities are also increasing. We are currently capitalizing on the second wave of biotech plant design efforts and expect a third wave from other major companies to meet pipeline products currently in Phase II clinical trials. Our global manufacturing facility expertise in emerging areas such as cell and gene therapy is also being sought after as client shift their focus to small scale manufacturing approaches using disposable technology. Geographically major CapEx spend continues in Ireland, where we are growing market share through concerted efforts to expand our life sciences presence in Germany and Switzerland along with the West Coast of the U.S. The India market remains flat, although we expect activity to increase next year as new incumbents plan investments in biosimilars. Opportunities in our consumer product and manufacturing clients are all also increased during the fourth quarter and we're seeing growth opportunities as we establish new alliances in the consumer goods market. Most exciting was the contract award to provide design service for Vastly's $2 billion tissue and fertilizer investment in Virginia, the single largest Chinese Greenfield economic development project in the U.S. This award is indicative of the upward investment trend in pulp and paper particularly as established European and Chinese companies expanding the U.S. and is welcome news for us as we have a strong history and reputation supporting the sectors largest producers. Our field services business is seeing an increase in project activity, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to several petrochemical wins, we secured a four year framework agreement with a new client in the private sector water market, which will have a positive effect for adjacency work and our buildings and infrastructure line of business. Sales activity is also increasing in standalone construction capabilities and we are seeing an uptick in opportunities with clients in the U.S. and Canada for sustaining capital services. With expansion of Morocco's transport, energy and residential commercial sectors, we are leveraging our relationship with our joint venture partner OCP to include mid-cap EPC and maintenance opportunities. We anticipate this could be an area of growth for our field services sector in fiscal year 2017. Turning to Slide 10, our petroleum and chemicals line of business saw a significant backlog increase of $361 million over the quarter and is now at $5.5 billion, near the year ago backlog level. Upstream oil and gas markets remain weak although we're seeing signs of stabilization with oil prices hovering in the $45 to $50 range over the past six months. Inventory builds appear to be flattening and OPEC is again talking production caps, although high inventories and a quick return of production from proven oil reserves will likely moderate crude prices. Established producers continue to make necessary investments to maintain production, but budgets will only begin to increase as balance sheets stabilized and producers gain confidence that prices can be sustained above $50 a barrel. With the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids in the U.S., we're more focused on pursuing opportunities in the midstream arena. Process and pipeline infrastructure needs to be put into place to move these barrels to market. Additionally, propane, butane and naphtha oversupply in the U.S. Gulf Coast is forecast to continue, which will require additional export infrastructure or conversion capacity to alleviate. The global access of LNG will also renew efforts to develop alternative markets. Central South America, Asia and Africa are likely targets for gas to power and small gas distribution projects and additional LNG penetration is likely into the transportation fuel markets, sparking new projects. The refining market is comparatively steady, although profitability is at lower levels than eighteen months ago. And consequently this will impact capital spend over the near-term. Despite this, we're seeing continuing opportunities in maintenance, turnaround, efficiency improvement and regulatory projects particularly as we expand our J-Pro initiative, our new safety, reliability and process optimization service offering. In the U.S., there continues to be increased focus on process safety and octane improvement projects while the U.S. refining margins also continue to be supported by product exports to Latin America. As previously reported, we continue to see feasibility study request in developing countries across Asia and Africa and the recent decision by the International Maritime Organizations Marine Environmental Protection Committee confirmed reinforcement of regulations to reduce the global sulfur cap on bunker fuel from 2020. Grassroots refining opportunities are also developing in India and South Asia driven by a growth for clean transportation fuels. The downstream petrochemicals market remains strong and we continue to expect multiple investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast to Middle East. We're seeing interest from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere regarding development of crude oil to chemicals projects. And there's increased focus on diversification moving away from first line commodity chemicals, ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks are also plentiful and relatively cheap and will provide economic incentives for project developments. This is a global trend, which is driven by the excess of pet-chem feedstocks being exported from the U.S. We had several exciting wins in the quarter including a confidential grassroots chemical facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast, an engineering services contract for TransCanada, and EPC contract with INEOS for a linear alpha olefin unit in Texas and a refinery upgrade fee project for the Singapore refining company. With that I will now pass it to Kevin to discuss the financials in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thanks, Steve. I'm turning now to Slide 11 and you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, down approximately 15% versus our third quarter last year. For the year revenue was $11 billion, down 10% versus last year. EPS on an adjusted basis was $0.77, which excludes $0.53 per share in after-tax restructuring and other charges, which are comprised of after-tax charges of $0.30 per share in connection with our restructuring activities that began in fiscal year 2015, $0.14 per share loss on the sale of our French subsidiary, as a result of our strategic decision to exit our French operations, and a $0.09 per share non-cash write-off on an equity investment. While the adjusted EPS of $0.77 for the fiscal year \u2013 fiscal quarter four was lower than $0.80 reported in the comparable quarter last year, note that fiscal year 2015 included a 53rd week in our Q4 results in 2015, which added approximately a $0.03 per share benefit to the year ago quarter. Book-to-bill on a trailing 12 month basis continue to improve over the course of fiscal year 2016 and ended at a high for the year at 1.0 times. Q4 gross margin percentage was up 120 basis points versus the year ago quarter, indicative of our improving execution and focus on cost discipline. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business continues the positive trend that we have seen earlier this year. Specifically, this helped to increase our consolidated gross margin percentage in the second half of 2016 by 70 basis points versus the same period of 2015. For the full year, adjusted G&A was reduced by a $127 million versus the last fiscal year or an improvement of 9.3%, again a positive indication of our success in right sizing the company and driving cost efficiencies. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $134 million, an improvement of 25 basis points on an operating profit margin basis versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Specifically in the second half of 2016, our improving traction and financial discipline resulted in our operating profit margin improving versus the second half of 2015 by 30 basis points to 5.2%. Finally, our efforts to improve our accounts receivable efficiency saw our DSO improving to 70 days at year-end versus 77 days last year as noted earlier by Steve. As a result, free cash flow also continued to improve totaling $213 million for the quarter, an improvement of $134 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, free cash flow reached $612 million, up $216 million versus year ago and the highest in the history of the company. At fiscal year end, the company's net cash position now stands at $268 million, an improvement of $140 from the last quarter sequentially and a more significant $405 million turnaround from last fiscal year-end. So turning to Slide 12, you will see the Q4 and fiscal year 2016 adjusted segment financials for our four lines of businesses. As you can see, two of our four business lines increased their segment operating profit versus the year ago quarter. Importantly, three of our LOB's improved their adjusted operating profit margins both for the quarter and for the full-year versus the year ago periods. Regarding aerospace and technology, while we did see a decline in adjusted operating profit versus the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the adjusted operating profit for the entire fiscal year held near flat, despite a decrease in revenues on account of a 70 basis point improvement in margins for the year. The improvement in the margin profile of the year was driven by strong performance fees particularly in Q3 and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of this line of business. The buildings and infrastructure business also saw revenue decline in Q4 versus the year ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit actually increased by a significant 79% and finished up 20% for the whole of fiscal year 2016. This was driven by a significant improvement in project execution, which allowed higher project margins versus a more challenged Q4 and full-year in 2015. As a result, the operating profit margin for this business was up 380 basis points in Q4 and 190 basis points for the full-year versus the year ago periods. The industrial line of business saw an increase in revenues for the quarter of 12% versus the year ago quarter supporting a nearer 11% increase for the fiscal year driven by strong performance in our life science business. Despite this, adjusted segment operating profit was down 54% versus last year's Q4 when compared to the year ago period and down 36% for the fiscal year. 2016 challenges were related to several project disputes and client settlements in Q2 and Q4 of 2016, primarily in our mining business. In addition, last year had a significant benefit in Q2 associated with successful closeouts associated with several large projects. Lastly, our petroleum and chemicals line of business saw a 33% decline in revenue for Q4 versus the year ago period, but a far more positive 6% increase in adjusted operating profit over the same period. The fall in revenue was also apparent for the full year given the challenging end market dynamics. Despite these challenges, segment operating profit margin has actually increased by 180 basis points for the quarter and by 60 basis points for the full-year versus the year ago like periods, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost efficiencies and restructuring in this line of business. So moving to Slide 13, you will see the split of revenues and segment operating profit by each LOB. As discussed over the past several quarters, the strength in some of our lines of businesses such as buildings and infrastructure and aerospace and technology, demonstrate the benefits of our diverse portfolio in maintaining relative stability in times when economic challenges exists in certain of our end markets. What is clear is that the shape of our portfolio is changing. Specifically, those LOBs that are most impacted by global commodity price changes are representing a lower percentage of the profits of the company while other businesses are expanding. Consequently, the position of our portfolio offers us two advantages at this point in time. First, we continue to be well positioned to further leverage off of our strong position in those businesses that are not impacted by commodities. And two, we are at a point where further fall-off in our commodity-oriented businesses obviously less likely. As a result, there is real upside for these businesses when commodity prices do ultimately improve. This argues for relative stability in the short run with upside in the long run. Moving to Slide 14, we continue to be successful with our restructuring and efforts to improve financial discipline and performance. Restructuring that began in July of 2015 was aimed at simplifying the business and enhancing our cost effectiveness. Our LOB realignment and continued drive to identify cost savings allowed us to find additional cost savings opportunities over the course of the year. And as a result, our final savings are expected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million with total cost approximating $390 million to $400 million. Relative to our cash cost and savings, our payback is slightly less than one year. I am pleased to report that we are on track to obtain the full run rate of these savings in fiscal year 2017 and the reduction in adjusted G&A of $127 million we achieved in fiscal year 2016 is evidence of this, especially when adding to the savings already realized in 2015. Further savings that we were realized in 2017 are important as it will allow us to reinvest back into the business to fund certain strategic investments in the company and to enhance our position to drive profitable growth in the long-term. Finally, before turning it back over to Steve, Slide 15 provides a short update on our share buyback program activities for fiscal year 2016. During the quarter, we continue to execute share buybacks in a balanced and steady manner, bringing the total repurchases for the fiscal year to 3.4 million shares for a total of $153 million. This represents a 3.7% reduction in shares outstanding for fiscal year 2015. As you are aware, we have previously indicated that we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the three year program. We plan to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure strategy at our 2016 Investor Day, next week, on Thursday, December 1st. With that let me hand it back over to Steve for closing comments. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Kevin. Moving to the last slide, we're pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. We expect challenging market conditions to continue into fiscal year 2017. Weak growth in developed markets, geopolitical issues and uncertain commodity prices will continue to impact some of our end-markets. Much like the beginning of last year, our oil and gas mining and certain industrial clients are continuing to avoid large capital expenditures to conserve cash. We do believe most of the declines in these end markets are now behind us, but it remains to be seen when industry growth will return in these sectors. More positively, we saw select growth opportunities in our buildings and infrastructure, aerospace and technology and life sciences markets in fiscal year 2016 and we expect further growth in these end markets in 2017. As we progressed through our fiscal year 2016, we saw a backlog stabilize and then increase by the fourth quarter. And we expect further increases to our backlog as we progress through fiscal year 2017. We also remain heavily focused on improving margins. The restructuring we have undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and supports our ability to invest back in our profitable growth agenda. We are seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts and write offs continue to be reduced across the board. Finally, our efforts to improve our financial performance in 2016 and particularly our operating profits, gives us confidence and a more stable outlook for fiscal year 2017. Consequently, we're providing initial guidance between $3 and $3.30 for adjusted EPS, which provides for operating profit growth in a continuing challenged market environment and includes a set of largely one-time investments of $0.15 per share to support our growth strategy. As Kevin mentioned, our strategic review is complete and we look forward to our discussions next week at our Investor Day on December 1st, where we will outline our strategy for long-term sustainable shareholder value. With that I'd like to thank you for listening and we\u2019ll now open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mr. Revich is your line on mute? Kevin Berryman : Hello, Jerry, are you there? Dan, we move on to next question. Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Steve Demetriou : Good morning, Andrew. Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Kevin, just if you can start with cash flow. Can you talk about the improvements in working capital that you can continue to record if my math is right the free cash flow conversion on adjusted net income looks like it was over 150% in FY 2016? When you look at FY 2017, could you still achieve free cash conversion north of 100% and how much more runway do you have toward working capital improvements? Can you get DSO sustainably under 70 days because that\u2019s already a pretty good target? Kevin Berryman : Thanks for the question, Andrew. Look, we\u2019re very pleased with the amount of progress. A lot of hard work within the lines of businesses to really gain some momentum in the back half of the year specifically on improving our DSO, it doesn't just automatically happen. I do think that our year-end position is really quite good. And the way we think about why being long-term working capital benefit and specifically accounts receivable isn't about a point in time. It's about an average level, so that we ultimately are able to have a sustainable level of working capital. So having said all of that, I would not perceive us being able to necessarily have the kind of free cash flow that we saw in 2016 per se, but we are planning on continuing to drive DSO improvements in 2017. It will be part of our financial metrics. We'll talk a little bit more about this in our Investor Day next week, but we still think there are opportunities to improve and longer-term be a more efficient capital investment behind our business, which ultimately we\u2019ll increase our return on invested capital. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, thanks for that Kevin. And Steve, I kind of have to ask you a topical question, which I'm sure you\u2019re expecting and it does involve U.S. transportation. You mentioned it's sort of a steady business right now, but you also talked about strength or positioning that you have in California, Texas, Florida. Can you talk about the confidence that you have in these markets maybe beginning to pick up after we did get some positive referendum spending? And then maybe talk about Jacobs\u2019 overall positioning if Trump does get through a bigger spend on infrastructure? How do we think about that and early sort of thoughts? Steve Demetriou : Yes, well, as I mentioned, we feel very well positioned with where our major abilities are in the U.S. Texas, Florida, California where we do see pretty robust certain spending, more certainty around spending in those areas. And those are three states where we believe provide leadership and strong abilities. So we were bullish on our capabilities to grow in transportation regardless of the election outcome. And so, we're pleased to see a lot of positive hype around what's going on with the Trump expectations, but we were positive moving forward in transportation. And when we talked about transportation by the way, we think of not only highways but we think of rail where we've got a very strong position and then the broader aviation sector where we're seeing the big benefits of how we've integrated buildings and infrastructure because as you know we get into aviation projects, it\u2019s a combination of infrastructure, but as well as building facilities. And our new line of business structure has given us the capability to leverage off of certain strengths regionally and take those strengths globally. And I think you're going to see us win projects around the world. Over the next several quarters that are going to be very exciting. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And then Kevin maybe if I could just ask you about the mining disputes in the quarter. You know you mentioned second quarter and now in the fourth quarter, is there any concern that we should have that these things continue or maybe get bigger or is it basically sort of the tail end of the mining cycle and 2017 should be a cleaner year for that? Kevin Berryman : Look, I will answer the question in a couple ways. The first one is, as we've been improving our project execution, we're seeing a holistic reduction in terms of some of the potential exposures relative to us losing some margin because of certain project disputes with our clients. So, in general, we're seeing a reduction in 2016 and also into 2017. So we holistically are seeing a reduction. As it relates to the specific question on mining, you know, that that business is really quite challenged right now. We're not doing much work and a lot of the work that we are doing is sustaining cap related activities plus obviously we have the new project we announced up in Mongolia, I think that was last quarter or a quarter before. So I think we're well positioned as it relates to our ability to deliver against our actual margin and in that particular business going forward. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Steven Fisher : Just a quick clarification first what the tax rate that you guys have assumed for fiscal 2017? Kevin Berryman : Look, we've effectively always \u2013 we\u2019re in the neighborhood of low 30s basically and we would expect that that will be able to continue to drive towards those kind of numbers. Steven Fisher : Okay, that's helpful. And then in 2016 three out of your four segments had declining revenues, but you're talking now about a pivot to growth. Can you just talk about what that that means exactly? How many segments do you expect to grow versus decline in 2017? And are you expecting overall revenue growth? Kevin Berryman : So, I think the revenue is a tough metric for our company because as you know we have certain businesses we win with pass-through revenue. And we typically like to focus in on the professional services side where we get good margin. And we have shifted our strategy as we go forward that we're going to be much more conscious of the total margin. And therefore whether it\u2019s professional services or the field services side, we're expecting to drive margin improvement. And as a result, you're seeing the effect to some extent of a strategy mix of really focusing on margin as we also drive down costs and all the things that we've talked about for fiscal year 2016. But as we move into 2017, we are talking about the whole shift of \u2013 and pivoting to growth and we feel like its pretty broad based. As you saw, we got backlog growth in our petroleum and chemicals business, which I think is extremely successful achievement in light of the tough conditions. And that\u2019s because of a successful strategy shift to really focus on petrochemicals. Lions share of our wins are coming in petrochemicals. We continue to see a very robust pipeline of activity in petrochemicals. And again, our new line of business structure has given us the opportunity to really globalize and expand beyond our previous core client focus to a much larger set of customers. So we see that in petroleum and chemicals. I think we gave you a sense that building an infrastructure. We\u2019re pretty bullish globally. And we are actually leading the way in growth in Australia. Our Australia team on the backs of what came out of the political situation last year has really driven some spending increase across that country and we're now seeing momentum in the U.S. and UK, as well. So, very positive on building an infrastructure. Aerospace and technology, one thing in that business, we all need to remind ourselves about is that from 2010 to 2015, there was a 25% decline in federal defense spending in the U.S. and in spite of that we held our backlog up. And now as we\u2019ve progressed our strategy and we\u2019ve seen stabilization of that spending and we're gaining market share in what's a very large spend in the government services, in the U.S. especially, we believe as we get through 2017, we're going to actually see backlog growth and revenue growth. I think the area that right now is I'd say more stable is the overall industrial segment because that is made up of a lot of different businesses and there's a bit of a timing going on when we win the next wave of pharma projects as we burn off some backlog in that business. So that's kind of the overall story of sales growth. Kevin Berryman : Steven, this is Kevin maybe augmenting Steve\u2019s commentary specifically started his discussion relative to that focus on margin and that we're looking really to focus on driving a profitable growth agenda as opposed to just a growth agenda. So that's an important point that he made. The other note that is important to understand is as we rook at this focus of pivoting to our profitable growth agenda, I would say in those businesses, specifically petroleum and chemicals, we're still comparing to some pretty big year-ago numbers and the stabilization of that business is happening as we speak. So as we progress over the course of 2017, we would expect that that pivot to growth will actually play out hopefully in the petroleum and chemicals business. But at least in the near term, there will be some pressure points in the first quarters of the year. Steven Fisher : Okay, just quickly the $0.15 of strategic investments, can you just say what that is and have those been made already, is that just technology or is that more M&A related, what is that? Steve Demetriou : So next week at Investor Day, we're going to layout our growth strategy and talk a little more about that, but it\u2019s really near-term investments, very heavily weighted toward the first quarter and a large portion of it in the first quarter of our current quarter fiscal year. It involves a set of actions to ignite our strategy and position us or to achieve our three-year goals that we're putting into our strategy. And it involves some external consultants that we're bringing in as part of our strategy execution. It involves a major new tool set and project controls, and a few other areas of delivering projects and also some systems enhancements that we're implementing as we as we speak. So, again, very front-end loaded to the fiscal year. And we believe are going to be critical and measurable as far as how we achieve our three-year growth strategy. Steven Fisher : Thanks guys, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Good morning. I guess a couple questions. First, Steve just with regards to the restructuring actions, we've been through, I guess, several increases in terms of the restructuring actions that you've taken. I mean do you feel like we're finally at the point where this is sort of the last round of costs that we're through enough that we shouldn't see more cost increases going through at 2017. I\u2019m trying to figure out where we are in terms of the innings of the ball game there. And then I guess my two other quick questions, while it's still very early Steve, I think people are trying to figure out sort of post the election has the tone from customers changed at all, do you feel like its post-election? And then my last question, any update that you could provide on the Motiva arbitration? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Yes, so with regard to the restructuring, we're in the very late stages of completing a very successful restructuring. And as we move into 2017, I really want to emphasize what we're talking about now is the pivot to growth, but we're not going to take our eye off the cost ball. We still believe that we have several productivity efficiency steps that we can implement on an ongoing basis, like all great companies do. But it's really to move away from a mindset of restructuring to do productivity and with a large effort around now taking that leaner cost structure and winning more business because of the competitiveness that that brought us. As far as the post-election situation, again I feel like I\u2019ve commented on that Jamie that with everything we were doing to position ourselves for growth, we attributed the momentum to that activity and less around the early stages of post-election. Are we optimistic? Yes. Do we hope all the stuff we read about happens? Of course. And we've seen what the Australian elections have done. And we hope that same thing happens in the U.S. And in fact Theresa May\u2019s administration in the UK is reaffirming several of the important nuclear and other projects in that region that are important to us. And so we feel good about what\u2019s going on globally around the political side of positioning our business. With regard to Motiva, the arbitration process continues. We continue to feel very confident around that whole activity. And we hope in the near-term, we\u2019ll be able to put that behind us and move forward. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal : Hi, folks congratulations on the good year. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Tahira. Tahira Afzal : Steve, if you look at three years from now, there is so many new developments that have happened on a macro level. Are you more excited about the opportunities on the aerospace and defense side? Are you more excited about infrastructure and this is on a global basis? Steve Demetriou : Right. So, I don\u2019t want to steal the thunder for next week and I know we\u2019re going to see you there. And so, we look forward to talking about this at length with the line of business leaders with Kevin and me going through this. But I think what you\u2019re going to see Jacobs shifting and the shift is already underway is that we really have moved from a company that had 250 offices that everyone around the world at Jacobs was sort of locally focused on how to win business at offices. To a much more targeted strategic growth strategy that\u2019s going to be fact based around where we believe the markets are growing fastest, where we\u2019re the natural owner of that market if you will and where we\u2019re strong. And therefore still maintaining a very strong diversity of end market participation, but I think a much more focused strategic area. And we\u2019re going to highlight what those markets are next week. They clearly involved building an infrastructure markets. But even within that big B&I sector, there is going to be priority targets. Aerospace and technology, of course, is going to lead the way. And you\u2019re going to hear about the focus there and how we\u2019re going to extend into some new areas outside of our current situation. And even in petroleum and chemicals I think I\u2019ve already talked about the focus on downstream and petrochemicals and Gary Mandel will talk about that next week and discuss how we\u2019re going to focus there and a few other important sub-verticals across Jacob. So, we\u2019re looking forward to laying that out next week. Tahira Afzal : Okay. And Steve, I know you sort of emphasize the one-time nature of the investments you are making next year, the $0.15. So some of our companies in the past they end up being more recurring. What gives you confidence that that is going to be more of a one-time element? Steve Demetriou : The first thing that gives us confidence is our culture, the transparency, the rigor, everything is traced now as far as making sure when we talk about restructuring costs that we\u2019re going to get the savings and we cement those savings in and they are not offset somewhere else. And so, the same question you have is the same sort of \u2013 and I\u2019ll just say the paranoia that we have to track the spending, track the savings and demonstrate that they\u2019ve given us profitable growth. And I think that\u2019s the best way to answer it is that\u2019s just our culture moving forward. Tahira Afzal : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Anna Kaminskaya : Good morning guys. So my first question is just around the cadence of quarterly EPS next year. I think you\u2019ve mentioned 1Q will have the $0.15 of growth investment. So, should we be thinking that kind of 1Q EPS will be somewhat below what the Street is modeling and your outlook is more second half weighted? Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Anna. This is Kevin. Yes, our Q1 is going to be the quarter where we will face some comparable issues versus year ago. Remember last year, we had a discrete tax item benefit of \u2013 I think it was $0.09 a year ago. So that\u2019s not necessarily going to be repeated. And then, of course, we have the investments that Steve related to. But the other dynamic is also that as we\u2019ve stabilized or we believe that we\u2019re beginning to stabilize our revenues, the first quarter of this year compared to last year, there still was a larger revenue stream that we were realized in the first quarter. So there is specifically some challenges in Q1. And as it relates to your specific comment about the balance of the year that\u2019s where we see the pivot that Steve is alluding to while we\u2019ll start to be able to see improved EPS growth in the back part of the year. But certainly Q1 will have some comparability challenges versus year ago. Anna Kaminskaya : Okay. And then on the backlog I think you mentioned and you expect growth in 2017 are there any particular large projects that are driving it or are you just seeing better opportunities across the board? And I think you also mentioned that you are changing your incentive structure, I\u2019m not sure if you can touch on it, today or we have to wait until next week? How do you balance backlog growth against profitable backlog growth? And you mentioned that environment remains competitive, we have seen it across different companies. How do you ensure and how do you see \u2013 kind of how do you get visibility into profitable backlog growth? Steve Demetriou : Right, so a lot in that question but great question. The backlog momentum is really across the board rather than any single projects. I think that\u2019s been traditionally Jacobs\u2019 strength is that we\u2019re not over reliant on large projects that it really is built off of our strong end market diversity. And I think I covered that earlier that we actually see it in most of our line of businesses and feel throughout the year that that\u2019s going to happen. Last year, we recognized the need to really drive cash and put DSO and working capital in our management incentive compensation targets. And we\u2019re going to maintain that going into 2017 because we believe as Kevin said there is more working capital efficiency out there. But as we pivot to growth, we now want to do the same thing with backlog growth specifically. And I think you hit the nail on the head that is profitable growth. And so as we look at backlog growth without getting into the specifics what our board is going to hold us accountable for is actually the gross margin in that backlog growth. So it is going to be aimed at profitable backlog growth and we put new systems and tools in place to be able to measure that growth, which kind of goes to the last question as we talk about margin focus and it\u2019s still in a very tough environment. I think the major difference moving forward is we now have the ability to measure profitability by client, by office and many other ways in a much better way than we had a few years ago. So as everyone goes after upgrading the mix, they actually have the tools and capability to track that. Anna Kaminskaya : Okay, super helpful. And then maybe last question more of a modeling for Kevin. Just looking at corporate expense, you\u2019ve been running at $20 million and this quarter it\u2019s only $2 million. Is it just allocation of corporate expense to the segments and how should we model it kind of going forward? Kevin Berryman : Look, I think modeling the total year figures is probably not an inaccurate way to think about 2017 consistent with 2016. There can be some variability in those numbers just because of how the true-ups occur over the course of the year, but generally speaking, modeling kind of consistent with 2016 is not a bad idea. Anna Kaminskaya : Great, thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard : Yes, hi. Good morning. What percentage of your year-end backlog will be recognized as revenue for 2017? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how much of the 2017 earning has already booked versus what you need to win for 2017? Kevin Berryman : Hi, Chad, we typically have about 60%, 65% which were in that range as it relates to the percentage of our backlog that we would expect to burn in 2017. Chad Dillard : Thanks. And then on the petroleum and chemicals margins, I saw a nice step up in this fourth quarter at about 5%, were there any one-time items or non-recurring items to contemplate? And then is this the run rate that we should be contemplating going forward? And if you could just touch on just how to think about margins for the rest of 2017 that would be helpful. Kevin Berryman : Yes, we did have some specific items that help support the margins in 2016 fourth quarter. However, I will really suggest that the biggest driver to the overall performance in petroleum and chemicals over the course of the year with a very, very strict adherence to the restructuring and delivering cost savings as it relates to that. So as we think about 2017 going forward, the fundamental profitability of that business has been reoriented to ensure that the savings profile that was developed over the course of 2015 and 2016 was an aggressive restructuring effort carries forward and allows us to continue to have an improved dynamic of longer-term in the petroleum and chemicals business. Chad Dillard : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Justin Hauke : Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to focus a little bit more on the moving pieces on the margins for next year. Just given the tax rate that you gave and the pivot towards growth it would imply that the margins are up \u2013 I don\u2019t know 20 or 30 basis points at the midpoint of guidance. And I\u2019m just trying to understand I mean some of that\u2019s going to be just the benefit alone from the mix shift of your business lines, but you also have the unrealized savings from the restructuring. So may be just an update on what the net savings are thus far and how much more still to go in 2017? Kevin Berryman : Look, thanks for the question. We\u2019re going to be talking little bit about this at our Investor Day, so sorry to punt a little bit, but we will talk about it. Look I think the comment I would make is first, there is a focus on attempting to drive incremental margins for the business in general. So you made the comment that there is an implication of margin that certainly would be our intent that we try to drive improvements in margins longer-term. So that certainly consistent with our intent, but we\u2019ll provide a little bit more detail in terms of the restructuring, the investments we\u2019re making all of those types of things which we started to talk about over the course of this call and we\u2019ll talk in more detail next week. But clearly, the intent of our business and certainly the profitable growth pivot that Steve has alluded to is very much about trying to ensure that as we build from are now more profitable foundation that we\u2019re adding profitable growth to it. Justin Hauke : Okay, that\u2019s fair. We\u2019ll look forward to next week. And I guess maybe the other question and maybe this is going to be addressed next week as well. But since you did mention in the prepared remarks that you are in a net cash position, the buyback is still steady at $500 million three-year pace that you talked about. Is there any comment that you want to offer at this point about where you see your balance sheet trending to, what you see at an optimal capital structure and how you might deploy that? Kevin Berryman : More to come next week. Justin Hauke : All right. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. We\u2019ll look forward to it. Kevin Berryman : Very good. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Steve Demetriou : Hello, Michael. How you are doing? Michael Dudas : I\u2019m wonderful. Thank you. Just quickly and I know will be in details next week. Steve as you look at the restructuring and how you positioned your lines of businesses; is Jacobs positioned or each line of business positioned to take on more risk or try to grab more margins on a project relative to a lump sum services or fixed price work? I guess it\u2019s edged up a little bit in the last 12 months to 18 months and relative to your total backlog, I\u2019m sure everything is scrubbed and quite profitable. But is Jacobs willing to kind of move down that curve as you come out for your \u2013 search for growth or pivot for growth rather? Steve Demetriou : Again, just so we don\u2019t keep saying this, but next week we\u2019re going to have a better opportunity to sort of lay that whole picture out for you and others. But I \u2013 just to kind of give you a bit of a headline to what you\u2019re hearing next week is that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a radical shift in our risk profile. I think there will be some modest improvements and I think it should be viewed as improvement that where we\u2019re capable of taking more intelligent risk. We will and we\u2019ve proven it over the last couple of years in certain areas where we\u2019ve been successful. Most of the write-offs that you hear about at Jacobs actually involved the more reimbursable side of our business. And where we have decided to take on some sort of fixed price risk in the past, it\u2019s actually been very successful. And so you\u2019ll see more targeted strategic moves to extend that where it makes sense. But very selective, very carefully and I think the guys will outline that next week. Michael Dudas : Fair enough, Steve. Have a great Thanksgiving, guys. Steve Demetriou : You too. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Hi, good morning. Kevin Berryman : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about within buildings and infrastructure you\u2019ve had excellent bookings all year. Can you just talk about based on the project timing when do you expect the revenue burn to accelerate and deliver year-over-year revenue growth. How do you see that over the next couple of quarters? Steve Demetriou : We\u2019re probably most positive on what Kevin talked about is the shift to not only see backlog, but see it in the top line revenue and our P&L in this business, building and infrastructure. So based on the size of the projects we do here and some of the other factors, we should see that earlier in the 2017 year than maybe some of the other LOBs. Jerry Revich : Okay, within aerospace and technology in the quarter, your revenue declined year-over-year basis was more than it has been in the trailing couple of quarters. Can you add some context, how much of that is project timing versus extra week day that you mentioned. Can you give us any more color on what were the big drivers and how we should be thinking about the revenue burn cadence for that product line on the same basis you just provided for billings and infrastructure in 2017? Steve Demetriou : Look, I think Jerry, on aerospace and technology, there is a shift in our mix, it is going on within that business right now. And that will ultimately result in there being some pressure point on our revenue in 2017. Having said all of that, very excited about the underlying shift to the good opportunities and growth opportunities longer term and at the end of the day the margin profile on the operating process will play out in a way that it will evident as we go through into the longer term. So some pressure I would say on 2017 purposeful and I expected as it relate to that business, but we think its reorienting the mix to something that will be more attractive longer-term. Jerry Revich : Okay. Your comments on top line are very clear Kevin. What about for margins as that what\u2019s \u2013 what are the mix shift implications could operating profits be more resilient than revenue for that line of business in 2017? Steve Demetriou : I think ultimately yes, but I\u2019ll let you figure that out as you model through. Jerry Revich : All right, thank you. Steve Demetriou : All right. Kevin Berryman : Okay. Well, thank you for calling in and we want to thank the investment community for listening to the quarterly call today. We believe the actions we\u2019ve undertaken continue to increase shareholder value. We\u2019re going to drive long-term sustainability of a stronger and healthier Jacobs. Look forward to seeing many of you next week and for those of you in the U.S. wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I will continue with some comments on our restructuring and capital allocation initiatives after which Steve will finish with some closing remarks. After, we will open it up for some questions. With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, our Chairman and CEO. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2017 first quarter earnings call. Before I begin, I'd like to recap the recently announced changes to our board of directors. Noel Watson, a true legend within our company and our industry decided to retire from the board last month. As many of you know, for more than 50 years, Noel has been wholly dedicated to driving our company's industry leading growth and success. He epitomizes inspirational leadership and has been a clear role model for me and everyone at Jacobs. And at the same time, John Coyne who served on our board since 2008 and who is an outstanding mentor to all of us on the leadership team, also announced his retirement. We wish both Noel and John success in their future endeavors. To replace the Independent Director position vacated by John Coyne, I'm pleased to welcome Robert McNamara to the Jacobs board. Bob brings a wealth of industry experience in many of the markets we serve and all of us on the board are excited to have him as a new director. Moving to slide five, I'd like to summarize our first quarter fiscal year 2017 results. As projected in last quarter's earnings call, the challenging global economic environment that we experienced the last few years extended into our first quarter, although with evidence that certain hard hit markets are starting to show signs of life. As a result of these prolonged market pressures, revenue burn in the first quarter was light at $2.6 billion. However, our focus on growth and specifically winning new business, is clearly gaining momentum. First quarter sales bookings were up 35% versus last year. And the higher value professional service component of our $18.1 billion backlog increased by more than $200 million sequentially. Equally important, unit gross margin improved to an overall company level of 16.4% of revenue as compared to 15.5% in last year's first quarter. And on the cost efficiency side of the equation, we continued to make great progress as we approached the final stages of the company-wide restructuring initiative that began nearly two years ago. Total first quarter SG&A cost was down 13% versus the same period a year ago. So, putting all this together, our strong margin focus, our rigorous internal cost discipline and improved operational performance contributed to first quarter EPS coming in modestly better than expected. On a GAAP basis, first quarter earnings of $0.50 per share was up versus the $0.38 per share achieved in last year's first quarter. And on an adjusted basis and excluding the discrete tax benefits of a year ago, we were pleased that our adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share stabilized versus last year's first quarter. I'm also pleased with the strong performance across the company in driving working capital efficiencies which led to a further increase in our net cash position by the end of the first quarter. Consequently, we announced an enhancement to our capital deployment strategy with the initiation of a quarterly dividend, while also continuing our share repurchasing program and increasing activity on exploring value-creating M&A opportunities. In early December, we hosted our Investor Day and presented our three-year growth strategy for the company and individual lines of business. As our current fiscal year progresses, we're beginning to see growth momentum build across the company, while we continue our transformation to a new stronger Jacobs. And, of course, in late December, we successfully concluded the Motiva arbitration, which was a very positive outcome for Jacobs, with the arbitration panel issuing a unanimous decision rejecting all of Motiva's claims and assigning no liability to Jacobs or our JV partner. So, moving to slide six. As I previously mentioned, our total revenue and backlog finished at $18.15 billion for the quarter, relatively flat versus a year ago, but down by approximately $600 million sequentially. The strengthening U.S. dollar was responsible for close to $200 million in negative foreign currency movements. And the decision by one of our clients to cancel a large pharmaceutical investment accounted for most of the remaining sequential decline in backlog. However, the underlying story in our backlog is much more positive. The higher-value professional services component of our backlog, which at $12.2 billion represents more than two-thirds of our total backlog, increased for the fourth straight quarter and ended up at the highest level reported since March of 2015. And compared to a year ago, our professional services backlog is up by over $800 million, despite more than $300 million of negative foreign exchange impact. So, as a result, the earnings potential in our backlog is measured by gross margin, is trending positively. As compared to last year's first quarter, gross margin in our backlog is up more than 10% and is almost modestly higher on a sequential basis. And when looking at the unit gross margin of our backlog as a percent of revenue, each of our four lines of business showed both year-over-year and sequential increases. So, we believe the increase in quality and overall positive backlog momentum is benefiting by our more disciplined approach and stronger focus on leveraging synergies across the company to win higher value work. Over the next four slides, I'll provide more specifics for each of our lines of business. Progressing to slide seven, our Aerospace & Technology line of business backlog remained steady at $5.1 billion versus last year and is up by more than $260 million year-over-year. It is also noteworthy that embedded in the A&T backlog is a year-over-year increase of $300 million of higher margin professional services work. The shift in mix to higher value business is offsetting a reduction in revenues associated with two contract re-bid losses back in the second half of 2015. Although we will continue to see pressure on our A&T backlog in the second quarter due to these prior year losses, we are optimistic that the strengthening pipeline of new business opportunities, estimated to now be at a record high level for our Aerospace & Technology business, will result in a growing backlog during the second half of this year. Across our markets, program funding continues to be stable, and we're targeting significant market share growth opportunities. Defense spending expectations are building momentum under the new U.S. Federal Government. Consistent with our strategy, we see significant opportunities in Weapon Systems Sustainment Services. In the first quarter, the U.S. Marines Special Operations Command logistics support contract win was a nice step towards organic growth in this sector. Also, positively during the recent quarter, we made good progress in resolving previously protested wins. A prime example being our award of the U.S. Air Force 53rd wing IT support services contract, which had been mired in protest for an extended period of time. The value of our awarded contracts remaining under competitor protests has significantly decreased to what we now consider to be the new norm of approximately $100 million of protested project awards. Homeland security, cyber and intelligence related markets remained strong as areas of national priority spend. Specific to our growing Jacobs Connected Enterprise service offering, the recently announced investment in ION software enhances Jacobs ability to deliver and manage Internet of Things capability for our global customer base across all four of our lines of business. The Jacobs Connected Enterprise suite provides clients the capability to connect, protect and analyze operational systems and data, and span several core functional categories including information technology and network infrastructure, cloud solutions, data analytics and cyber security. The diversity of our Aerospace & Technology business is a strength. The profitability of our U.S. telecom business continued to improve as unit margins increased, while we expand backlog with existing customers. In the UK, our position in the nuclear new build market continues to expand. In addition to the ramp up of work at EDF at Hinkley Point C, we've been appointed by NuGen as a strategic partner to assist them with overall program delivery. And we were also successful in winning an extension to an engineering support services contract we have with NASA and a technical support services contract with Ford Motor Company. Moving to slide eight, our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business is experiencing the best sales momentum in the company. Sales were up significantly versus the year-ago quarter and have continued to positively trend over the past several years. Our fiscal year first quarter backlog for Buildings & Infrastructure is now at $5.2 billion, which is up $120 million versus last quarter and more than $400 million versus the prior year period. Political dynamics are, for the most part, favorably impacting this business globally and seem to have unleashed some of the previous delays and opportunities. Specifically in the U.S., there was a flurry of activity late in the quarter of RFPs coming out across the federal, state and local levels, some fairly significant in size. Of particular strength for Jacobs in terms of recent wins and building pipeline opportunities are in highways, rail, aviation and federal buildings. Specifically in buildings, during the quarter, we were awarded critical framework agreements for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Air Force in Japan and the renewal of our position on the defense infrastructure panel for the Australia Defense Force. Also on the Buildings front, healthcare is strong with $15 billion in current projects under management across the U.S. And we're experiencing excellent momentum in Australia, where we won an architectural services contract for the New Wales \u2013 the South New Wales helped Blacktown Hospital in a principal design consultant contract for Queensland Health, Roma Hospital. There are also exciting growth opportunities in educational facilities in the U.S., UK and Australia driven in part by the expansion of students from Asia seeking higher education in these markets. And also on the Buildings front, we're actively targeting a select group of corporate clients and are seeing significant interest for fully integrated service delivery. Jacobs is particularly well equipped to respond to these needs due to our long-term client relationships across a number of industries such as oil and gas, pharma and chemicals. The global infrastructure market, specifically transportation, is providing growth opportunities in a sector where we have excellent market positions. We're seeing the UK government invest in infrastructure. Rail and transit spend globally continues to be positive, especially in California, the U.S. Northeast, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. Some recent wins include the Victorian Government Cranbourne-Pakenham transit depot, the transport for London-Camden station upgrade and a detailed design services contract for network enhancements for Sydney Trains. U.S. Federal highway spending remains steady, and we're focused on those states and counties which have recently funded revenue packages. Opportunities also exist in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. And we experienced several wins in the quarter, including the Florida Department of Transportation Turnpike, the Texas Department of Transportation I-30 design project and the Bruce Highway Upgrade in Australia. Investment in new and existing aviation facilities continues to grow across the globe. We've added top international aviation talent and developed innovative best practices to support our clients. This has led to a string of recent successes. After program wins toward the end of our 2016 fiscal year at LaGuardia and LAX, we had further significant wins in the most recent quarter, including at Heathrow and Melbourne airports, and are pursuing several other major airport programs around the world. Global water and environmental services markets continued to grow and we're having success in expanding our service offerings by leveraging our Tier 1 expertise in Europe and top quartile capabilities in Australia. We're pursuing a number of opportunities globally and we're pleased with recent wins, including a four-year extension to our Bear Creek Georgia Reservoir O&M contract, Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department, Melbourne Water Treatment Plant expansion, and the ConocoPhillips Australia environmental services panel. And we're also excited about the recently announced acquisition of Aquenta Consulting, which strengthens our leadership in integrated project delivery services in Australia and across Asia Pacific. I'm now on slide 9 in the summary of our Industrial line of business. In the first quarter, we experienced a significant burn in our Life Sciences' backlog, especially in the field services component. We also had the cancellation of a significant biotech project associated with our client's decision to cancel the expansion. As a result, our quarter-end backlog was reduced to $2.5 billion. However, the margin impact of this decline in backlog was minimal as the first quarter professional service portion of our Industrial backlog remains solid. And in fact, is up nearly a $100 million versus the year ago quarter. In Life Sciences, despite the one single large project cancellation, the pharma market continues to be strong, particularly in the biotech space. The sector continues to look positive with a strong pipeline of new drug developments. We anticipate the third wave of expansions to include billing capacity for drug substances and supply chain optimization. During the quarter, we captured a significant biotech manufacturing project award for a confidential client in our actively performing site selection services for their new facility. Our geographic market share continues to grow as we capture opportunities in Switzerland, Northern Europe and Hungary and we're seeing green shoots of recovery in China and Singapore. We've had success in expanding our construction management, commissioning and qualification capabilities to provide end-to-end solution for our pharma clients and we also had several recent wins this quarter in the Sustaining Services space, a strategic growth opportunity for our business. Consumer goods and manufacturing spend is steady. This is an area of opportunity for us as we expect increased activity from increased existing clients looking to appeal to consumers who expect high quality, convenient personal care and wellness products that are environmentally friendly. This quarter, we secured two front-end project development opportunities demonstrating the pulp and paper sectors continued growth. An area of particular strength for us. We're also seeing growth as top brand in Tier 2 manufacturers looking how to provide consumers direct-ship and e-commerce options. We are being rewarded with extensions from sustaining services contracts resulting from our relationships, capabilities and our ability to deliver value as the upward trend continues in this sector. Our field services business continues to create opportunities for us, particularly, as the U.S. and UK industrial sector show signs of recovery. We're seeing increased interest in construction and maintenance prospects from clients we do not traditionally serve, such as within the nuclear and automotive industries. Capturing this type of work and leveraging the adjacencies within our overall corporate portfolio is a real growth opportunity for us. Overall, we're seeing positive growth in field services in multiple geographies and industries with increased sustaining services prospects. In the specialty chemicals sector, positive trends continue for our Technology business, as our clients address new environmental regulations for sulfur emissions. Additionally, several early-stage opportunities emerge this quarter for bleach and chemical plant prospects in Finland, Russia, Uruguay and the U.S. During the quarter, we were awarded a major sulfuric acid plant contract in Canada. And in the mining sector, we're seeing increased activity in preliminary studies and value-improvement programs. Positively, we secured three significant wins in our first quarter. Two for front-end engineering and design investments in Canada and the third for a five-year sustaining capital program. These awards along with a recent rise in copper and other base metal prices, are indications that mining and metal sector is beginning to slowly recover. Turning to slide 10, our Petroleum & Chemicals revenue and backlog continue to stabilize in the first quarter at $5.4 billion. I'm very pleased with the quality of recent wins in our Petroleum & Chemicals business as evident by the unit gross margin and backlog increasing versus both last year and last quarter. The upstream oil and gas market got a positive boost during the quarter by the OPEC agreement to cut reduction. Oil prices reacted positively, moving up to a $50 to $55 per barrel range by the end of our first quarter. While this is a positive, there still remains a relatively high level of caution and uncertainty on crude prices over the near term. Looking further out, the crude market is expected to continue its slow recovery as demand for oil is forecast to modestly grow over the next several years. We do, however, expect market forces will continue to cause price volatility and that current high inventory levels coupled with a gradual recovery at non-OPEC crude productions will moderate any runway of prices. LNG prices experienced similar upward movement. U.S. LNG exports have been gradually increasing and moving to Asia markets due to a combination of higher demand, higher prices, and LNG plant outages in Australia. And we expect continued interest in new market creation scheme such as gas to power, small scale distribution, green fuel and transportation fuel substitution, which create opportunities for smaller scale LNG plant logistics investments, which is an area where we are more competitive. Refining markets are generally steady with continued focus on efficiency improvements, regulatory compliance and maintenance that was deferred over the last couple of years. We expect larger capital expenditure projects to remain centered in the Middle East and Asia. Prospects that we are engaged in are driven by the relative demand for diesel versus gasoline, which require reconfiguration of some of the new higher conversion refineries, increased octane requirements, increased coker capacity requirements due to the MARPOL regulations on high sulfur bunker fuels, and the continued trend to bring transport fuel quality of developing countries up to world's specifications. The chemical sector remains our strongest growth trend. The numerous ethane crackers in the U.S. coming online this year adding 7 million tons of capacity is promoting significant downstream investments, creating significant opportunity as our initiatives such as oil to chemicals and other chemical derivative opportunities benefiting from cheap feedstocks. Small and mid-cap spending is increasing on projects where we historically have our strongest share. It is positive to see the increasing pipeline of opportunities. And as a result of several recent project wins, petrochemicals is forecasted to represent more than two-thirds of our Petroleum & Chemicals business for fiscal year 2017. Turning it now over back to Kevin. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Now turning to slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. Adverse market conditions, as Steve noted, in certain end markets continued to impact top-line revenues during the quarter and resulted in revenues of $2.6 billion, down approximately 10% versus the first quarter of 2016. More positively, GAAP EPS was $0.50, up $0.12 versus the year ago quarter as costs associated with our restructuring efforts begin to slow as expected. On an adjusted basis, and when noting the $0.09 benefit in our EPS in Q1 of year ago associated with a discrete tax item, the company was effectively flat versus year ago on an operational basis at $0.68 versus a calculated figure of $0.69 in the year ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, backlog was $18.1 billion at quarter end and book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis remains above the weaker level seen in early fiscal year 2016 and finishing at 0.99 times compared to 0.92 times for the first quarter of 2016. Q1 gross margin percentage finished at 90 basis points versus the year ago quarter, further indications of our improved execution, our focus on profitable growth and cost discipline. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business was also up and improved to a level that the company has not seen since 2014. For Q1, GAAP SG&A was reduced a significant $50 million versus the year ago period as restructuring cost began to abate as expected. On an adjusted basis, SG&A fell $14 million versus the year ago period, continuing the positive signs of our success to drive greater cost efficiency. Operating profit for the quarter was $89 million or $120 million on an adjusted basis. And on an adjusted basis, the OP margin improved 20 basis points versus the year ago period, as our unit margin improvements have mitigated some of the challenged end market dynamics that we have faced. Finally, our efforts to improve cash flows have seen working capital decrease of 41% versus the year ago quarter, with receivables down 14% over the same period. DSOs were lower than the year ago quarter by three days and Q1 free cash flow was $84 million, a $70 million improvement versus the year ago period. At quarter end, the company's net cash position now stands at $347 million, an improvement of $79 million over last quarter, and a strong improvement of $528 million from the year ago period. Before moving on to the next slide, I wanted to also note that we have made a one-time accounting adjustment during the quarter to update our foreign goodwill balances in connection with certain exchange rate differences. These required adjustments were made during the quarter and were identified given the additional transparency provided by and our transition to the company's enhanced ERP system implemented in Q1. These adjustments were offset in the shareholders' equity of our balance sheet with zero impact to our P&L and/or our cash flow. And only were related to the translation of our goodwill and intangible balances to our U.S. dollar functional currency. The adjustments were also deemed immaterial, and as such, we have made the correcting adjustments during the quarter. For further information, I refer you to our latest 10-Q that was released earlier this morning. So turning to slide 12, you will see the Q1 segment financials for our four lines of businesses. Regarding our Aerospace & Technology line of business, we saw a positive 6.4% increase in adjusted operating profit versus the first quarter of last year, and an increase of 170 basis points in our operating profit margin versus the same period. The improvement in the margin profile of the year was supported by a continued improvement in the margin mix of this line of business. The overall operating profit improvement occurred despite a drop in revenues. The reduction in revenue was driven primarily by certain unsuccessful rebids in 2015 associated with generally lower margin businesses. The margin in the quarter was further supported by additional project reserve releases given strong project delivery performance on several large projects. Meanwhile, the B&I business saw revenue improve by 3.1% versus the year-ago quarter. But due to the mix of work being burned, adjusted operating profit declined by 4.1% over the same period and margins were actually down a bit, 50 basis points. The margin in the quarter was impacted by certain project start-up delays which resulted in staff buildup costs being less billable than originally expected. Margins, however, are expected to rebound over the course of the year. The Industrial line of business also saw an increase in revenues for the quarter of 11.8% versus the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted operating profit was down 8.1% versus the same period and margins were also off 70 basis points. The primary driver of revenue growth would sum our Life Science business, although much of the incremental growth in this revenue was at lower margins due to field services work building on several major projects. In addition, our mining and minerals business also contributed to some of the margin weakness, given the impact of a project settlement in Q1 of the current year. Sequentially, our Industrial business rebounded well versus Q4, almost doubling from the Q4 figure of $13 million. Lastly, our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a 32% decline in revenue for Q1 versus the year ago period, but a more positive 30-basis-point increase in operating profit margin, as we increased our higher margin professional services workload in Petroleum & Chemicals. The fall in revenue was driven by the challenging end market dynamics that Steve has previously mentioned, but the margin improvement is a clear indication of the strong focus on cost, efficiencies and more profitable work. So, moving to slide 13, you'll see the split of segment operating profit by each line of business on a trailing 12-month basis for fiscal years, first quarter 2017 versus the year-ago period. As we've previously highlighted, our revenues in segment operating profit mix continues to evolve towards higher growth and higher margin businesses, consistent with our strategy. Two thirds of our segment profit now comes from our two highest margin businesses, and which those two combined have increased their percentage of total segment operating profit by 9 percentage points versus the year ago trailing 12-month period. In addition, revenues in corresponding segment operating profits from those portions of our portfolio most impacted by challenged commodity prices continue to represent smaller portions of our overall mix, respectively. However, as these markets begin to rebound, we believe we are well-positioned to leverage our global talent and skill set to see strong improvements in these businesses as well. In summary, the profit mix of our portfolio continues to underscore the industry-leading diversity and stability of our portfolio. The diversity positions us well for profitable growth; as one, we continue to drive growth in our higher margin businesses; and two, we position ourselves to drive growth in those businesses currently impacted by weaker commodities, as these markets begin to recover. Moving to slide 14. Over the quarter, we continued our efforts to improve our financial discipline and performance, while further enhancing our business structure and operations. The 2015 formal restructuring program is nearing completion, and has significantly enhanced our cost effectiveness as evidence by the reduction in adjusted selling, general and administrative cost of $62 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2015. The last reported quarter prior to the initiation of our restructuring program. Our lines of business realignment has further supported the restructuring effort, enhancing leadership focus and accountability. We will continue to take a rigorous approach to tracking business expenditures, and the return expectations associated with that. To that end, we previously announced during our fourth quarter 2016 call, and 2016 Investor Day that we are forecasting strategic investments to support various initiatives, and our pivot to growth. We have taken a very disciplined return on investment approach to these expenses, and much of the focus as you know is on upgrading our systems and tools. Our spend on these strategic investments started later than originally expected as plans were vetted and ultimately finalized. We now expect the spend to accrue over the first three quarters of the year as we continue to evaluate the mix of investments and returns associated with them. In Q2, we expect investments to approach approximately $0.05 earnings per share. Finally, slide 15 provides a short update on our capital allocation program activities for the first quarter. During the quarter, we continue to execute our share buyback program in a balanced and measured approach purchasing 600,000 shares for a total of $30 million. We have now spent $183 million of our approved $500 million share buyback program, purchasing 4 million shares in the process. We plan to continue to execute the remaining $317 million of this program in a balanced manner over the remainder of the three-year term of the program. In addition, we were excited to announce at our 2016 Investor Day that our board approved the implementation of a dividend program in fiscal year of 2017. We were also pleased to follow-up on this news by declaring in January a dividend of $0.15, a quarterly dividend payable on March 17 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17. Given the significant improvements we have implemented at Jacobs, and our continuing belief in being able to drive strong cash flows, we believe returning excess capital to our shareholders in this manner is an appropriate use of cash, and we'll continue to support shareholder value. Of course, we also believe that the strength of our cash flow not only supports these returns of capital to our shareholders, but still provides ample and the needed cash to support the most important use of cash, investments to drive our profitable growth strategy. To that end, after the close of the quarter, we have made two key growth investments. The first was our recently announced acquisition of Aquenta Consulting in Australia, which will support our integrated project service delivery in the Asia Pacific region. And then, of course, Steve also mentioned the investment on our new ION Software program, which will aid our Jacobs Connected Enterprise suite of services and enhance our ability to deliver, extend and manage this key growth initiative. With that, let me hand it back over to, Steve. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Moving to the last slide, we're pleased with the progress of enhancements we've made at Jacobs over the past 18 months, and the transformation that's now underway. We remain diligent in our pursuit of increased operational efficiencies, and are driving a number of significant improvement initiatives. Key over the next several quarters will be a continued strong discipline and focus on improving margins and cash flows. Overall, we continue to project a stable fiscal year with strong underlying operational performance. Our adjusted EPS guidance remains at $3 to $3.30 range. This includes certain strategic investments associated with our strategy implementation, which we will continue to make in the second quarter. However, the key change occurring in the company is our shift from a total focus on cost restructuring over the last two years to now a relentless focus on winning new business that provides profitable growth. From a market standpoint, we're more positive, partly because certain hard hit markets, such as oil and gas and mining are showing signs of life. But also due to the more robust dynamics of buildings, infrastructure, aerospace, technology and pharmaceuticals markets. All of this is giving us more confidence that we will see an increase in Jacobs' backlog in the second half of our fiscal year, positioning us for a stronger 2018 bottom line performance. The key is staying focused on executing the growth strategy we presented in December. This includes focusing and investing in the priority targeted markets and geographies where we see the best growth and margin profile, where we have differentiated capabilities and fit, while continuing to execute on a series of transformational initiatives that will ultimately drive a higher-growth, higher-margin, higher-return business; all with the ultimate objective of increasing shareholder value. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions. Anita? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. I guess, a couple of questions. One for, Kevin and then one for Steve. Kevin, on the strategic investment, how much is the first quarter? I know you said $0.05 will hit the second quarter, and there'll be some in the third quarter? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: We estimated about that same level. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, $0.05 in the first quarter? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yes. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Because I guess, as I sit here and if I just take the fourth quarter, and then we're going to have incremental headwinds from the investment, $0.10 over the next two quarters. If you take the first quarter, you multiply by four, it implies you're $2.70 something with $0.10 more in incremental headwinds. So I'm just trying to understand what are the drivers behind the EPS ramping, the main drivers to get to even the midpoint of your guidance. I understand, the margin profile within the backlog is better. But we're still seeing significant sales decline. So I mean, is the lower-end, low to midpoint more likely or am I missing something? And then, I guess my second question, Steve, obviously, on the A&T side, the profitability was good. It sounds like there's a lot of potential \u2013 the bid opportunity looks pretty good. So could you just help me with one, in terms of the bids outstanding when you expect those to hit and does that help more 2018 versus 2017? And then, I think, last quarter you said you expect revenues to be under pressure for the full-year, is that still the right way to think about it, just because it matters with \u2013 just because that's your more profitable business? Thanks. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Jamie, let me take a stab at a couple of the comments and then, Steve, wants to add some color commentary. First thing is, and you mentioned it actually in your question is the gross margin in our backlog is improving. And ultimately, we believe that, that gains additional momentum over the course of the year. And we do believe that, as the incremental focus that's being placed on the growth initiatives, which Steve alluded to in his closing comments is real. And so, the portfolio, both the near-term and the balance of the year growth opportunities are positive. So we see those things improving over the balance of the year. We still feel that $3 to $3.30 is an appropriate number, and that's what our forecast and expectations will be at this point in time. I will tell you, and you heard me say it in Q1, that it is going to be important for us to develop some growth momentum over the course of the year. So, we're seeing that happen already with the gross margin and backlog, and we expect that, that will continue to happen over the course of the year. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. So, Jamie, building on that and addressing your questions, let me start with the last part of it when we look at sort of the top line. As I mentioned, we see backlog bases building momentum through the year, and we see the same thing from revenue that will hit our P&L. So the same sort of second half stronger than the first half, which bodes well with regard to starting to see some year-over-year growth on the revenue side as we get into the second half. And when we look at that, it's pretty much across the company. Aerospace & Technology, which you've talked about, I can't emphasize enough our excitement around the pipeline. It's very robust. We're very excited about it. It does take time and probably more time in A&T than in any of our businesses to see it play through, because of some of the protest issues that go on in that industry. But we are bullish as we get into the second half. And I would say, of all the businesses that probably bodes well more for 2018 and 2017, because of the cycle time that I mentioned. Buildings & Infrastructure, clearly, a business that's building momentum, as we've seen quarter over quarter over quarter growth that will contribute to our second half strength versus the first half that Kevin talked about in this year's P&L, as well as a growing backlog. Industrial, we had some one-time issues in the first quarter as we mentioned on the mining business, a project completion write-down that we took that we'll see some momentum with that, and some of the other factors in that business. And then Petroleum & Chemicals, we also see building momentum as we get through the year on work that we won late last year, and also, some good book and burn business in the second half. So... Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I guess just to \u2013 just to be more clear, Steve or Kevin, to meet the low-end of your guidance, can you get there just on the margin improvement that you're seeing in your backlog or do we need incremental wins as well to hit the low-end? I'm just trying to figure out how I think about the low-end versus the high-end? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, there's a couple of things, Jamie, to think about. The other piece you didn't alluded to, which I think is, at least part of the equation is the incremental savings we're getting relative to the topping-off with a restructuring. So it's not the huge amount of money, but there is incremental savings that we'll see in the back half. So that will be a tailwind for us. As it relates to our margin profile that we have now, we're going to need additional margin wins to ultimately get to certainly the top-end of our range. So I think, the bottom end of the range will probably be more associated with \u2013 we're not seeing some of those incremental improvements that we expect. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Jerry, are you there? Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone. In Aerospace & Technology, you folks had excellent margin performance in the quarter; in the Q you spoke about some project close-out benefits and better progress on fixed price work. Can you just maybe parse that out for us? What was the project benefit? What do you expect the run rate margin of the portfolio to look like over the balance of the year? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Let me start just from a sort of a commercial and a mix standpoint that, clearly, the business, we mentioned some contract rebid losses in late 2015 that being replaced by new wins. The new wins are clearly higher value, higher margin business than the business that we were burning off on the contract rebids, the contracts that we had previously. So, there's been a very nice mix upgrade on the markets that Terry Hagen and his team have been going after. And it's consistent with the strategic focus that we talked about at Investor Day. Kevin, you want to take the, kind of the financial piece of that question? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think, the pop-up in the margin for the quarter specifically can pretty much attributed to some of the project stuff that we alluded to in our prepared remarks. I won't go into the details as it relates to that. But the margin you see in Q1 is not necessarily sustainable until we kind of see the building momentum as Steve has outlined, as it relates to the margin profile longer-term. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then, regarding the two contracts that are rolling-off, when will we have annualized the revenue run rate of those contracts completely off the books? Can you calibrate us there? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I think it's probably around third quarter, I believe... Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: ...is where we'll \u2013 third and fourth quarter is when we'll be past it. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then you folks have been looking to build backlog in your Chemicals business; exiting 2017, I'm wondering if you could just provide an update on those prospects and the derivatives work and any color you can share since the Analyst Day? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say everything we've talked about on the Investor Day is continuing to play through, very robust pipeline on the Chemicals side as we've talked about. We did a lot of front-end engineering design work last year. And what's happening now is, we're converting many of those to full EPC, EPCM projects. A lot of activity around the world, a lot of foreign investment coming into the U.S. to take advantage of some of the energy dynamics, cheap feedstocks and joining forces with \u2013 and joint ventures. And we're participating in several of those in the U.S. and Europe. German \u2013 the major German chemical players, a lot of activity there. And we're a leader in that market with a geographic presence and our capability. Asia Pacific, especially we're seeing Singapore, Indonesia, other markets, strong prospect. So and of course, I'm sorry, Middle East, that seems to be a lot of focused investment there, a lot of integrated refining chemical projects sort of new creative initiatives. So, we're very excited about that, and it's clearly the richest part of our pipeline. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Hello, Steven. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, could you just give a little more color as to why the revenue burn, it sounds like it was a little lighter than you expected in the quarter. And it sounded like your answer to Jamie, is maybe that the second half of the year we start to see the revenue start growing year-over-year, is that the right way to think about it? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, look one comment specifically \u2013 look, we're still comparing to Q1 of a year ago in our Petroleum & Chemicals business where we were still falling as it relates to that. We think we're getting to a point where we're going to become more stabilized, so that's going to end up improving the year-over-year comparison going forward. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And why... Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Let me just add to that, that I think, we've been pretty clear over the last year and a half that we're shifting to a more disciplined approach of not growing for the sake of growing, but growing profitably. And a lot of that has been shifting away from low-margin business to high-margin. Less focus on projects where we end up putting on the books on low-value field services work to where \u2013 we only want to do those projects if they're going to create value. And so, as we mentioned earlier, even though we have sequential backlog decline because of some of the dynamics about the large pharma, et cetera, the gross margin in our backlog is increasing. Our P&L, gross margin is increasing. I think, there's evidence that the quality of earnings are increasing and we're seeing underlying growth in that. And we believe that will start to play out in the actual P&L revenue by the second half year-over-year. So, we've been less focused. When you say below our expectations, that's not a number we've been focused on over the near-term, because it really, to us, is meaningless. What's more important is the gross margin improvement, the unit gross margins and ultimately the operating profit. And so, we're actually pretty pleased with the progress there and I think it will play out as the rest of the year goes on. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And it sounds like despite \u2013 due to the more stable oil prices, customers are still a bit tentative. What are they asking you for at this point on the projects that have been pending for a while? Are they still looking for more ways to take cost out of the project, is it different scopes or are they really just sort of waiting for something to give them the confidence to really pull the trigger? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, if you look and based on the clients we've talked to plus publics information, it's almost a 50/50 CapEx story. Half the companies are stabilizing to increasing CapEx and the other half are still shaving CapEx for cash flow. I think all of them are focused on prioritizing now maintenance and turnarounds that they deferred over the last couple of years and that's a sweet spot for us and that's what we're focused on with our clients. The other is any growth CapEx that has a short cycle return. So, very short-term payback type projects \u2013 productivity, very much productivity oriented. And that's a big focus for us, for a majority of our clients. Yes, we're involved in some of the Middle East and larger projects that will have a longer payback, but those are really focused far and few between, but I think the majority of it is really around regulatory maintenance, sustaining capital and quick return projects. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. It's Alan Fleming standing in for Andy today. Kevin, maybe I can start with a question on cash. I mean it looks like you converted about 100% of your adjusted net income to free cash this quarter, and I think 1Q tends to be a seasonally weaker quarter for you guys in terms of cash generation and I know you had talked about reducing the DSOs at the Analyst Day and it looks like you did that. But I guess the question is, did you maybe make a little bit more progress this quarter than you had expected? And is that progress sustainable? And then, what does that mean for the rest of the year given the target you put out there of kind of one-time net income I think over the next few years? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thanks for the question. Look, I think the reality of Q1, you're right. Certainly last year was a little bit lower in terms of the results in cash flow versus the balance of the year. But there can be some fluctuations in the quarter and you'd look back over time, you'll note that. I would say with the fall in the revenue that there is some incremental benefit that's occurring in our cash flow because of the working capital benefit. And so that has certainly helped support the Q1 cash flow. I don't think it has any implications differently than what I would have suggested relative to what we're going to try and do from a cash flow conversion perspective. But certainly, you need to take that into account as you're evaluating the analysis on cash flow because there was some benefit just because the business was down in revenue and so, obviously, working capital will go down relative to that. But we also saw some efficiency gains. And those efficiency gains are the things that we will need to continue to focus on to get the kind of targets that I've outlined as it relates to our future cash flows. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. I appreciate that Kevin. And then maybe a follow-up for you, Steve. You talked about mining in your prepared remarks. And I know mining is still a relatively small part of the business today, but you have the capabilities and resume for doing more mining work than maybe some of your peers do. And so, I'm wondering how do you see your mining footprint evolving over the next 12 to 18 months? And is it worth getting excited about mining today for Jacobs or is it just too early? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves, but we're clearly more optimistic today than we were 6 to 12 months ago. We've maintained, as you said, a very strong presence, strong team, talent base in where we think the money is going to be spent, places like South America, both Chile and Peru, Australia, we have \u2013 and other capabilities around the world. And we're involved in some of the key projects that are starting to get put back on the table. And so, I think, the other big factor there is the productivity of the whole mining sector has eroded, if you measure sort of the productivity of the mines over the last decade. And so I think between the clients wanting new innovative ways of improving the expansions or grassroot projects to be much more productive, as well as the fact that copper prices are now up 25% versus where they were six to nine months ago, and other metal prices are improving. There's more optimism building around CapEx spend and projects for us going forward. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Steve, do you think you can grow Mining backlog in 2017? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I think the answer is yes, but it will be fairly immaterial based on the starting point because our backlog just got destroyed over the last two or three years. But we're now getting more excited about what that backlog could look like going into 2018 and beyond. So, we'll just leave it at that. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it along. Operator : Our next question is from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Hi, folks. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Hello, Tahira. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I guess, first question, if I look at your longer term margin ranges that you gave at the Analyst Day, the two segments I noticed that's still a little below clip is Building/Infrastructure and Petroleum & Chemicals. Should we be seeing some visible improvement? What the range is as we head into the second half of the year? Is that where we should see that margin commentary you made really materialize? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, I think Building & Infrastructure, the more we grow, the better that margin can play out because we are pre-investing now in resources to go after the bridge pipeline that's emerging. And so, I think a lot of that will be building the backlog and continuing to drive some of the efficiencies across the company. And then getting some of these pre-invested resources build on to these growth projects will help build the margin over the course of the next couple of years, consistent with our strategy. Petroleum & Chemicals, I think clearly that margin has been under pressure because of the excess capacity in the industry. And as that business starts to recover, we should see a bit more discipline in margins across the market, but I would also say that P&C of all four of our lines of business has the most robust productivity, internal productivity efficiency improvements in the company when we look at transform the core. And that should play out with margin improvement through the three year strategies period that we talked about. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And I don't know if this question is more for Kevin. But the investments that you have made in the first quarter, are they concentrated in any one segment? Are they on the corporate side? Just to get an idea of how to think about them. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: It's spread across the \u2013 both the LOBs and the corporate business and then, of course, our corporate investments, ultimately much of them get allocated back to the LOBs anyway. So, there is some investments that are hitting the LOB operating profit, but it's spread across and they're all investing behind strategic initiatives. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. My last question is more macro. As you try to grapple with all the implications of what the new administration is proposing, clearly some positives on the Infrastructure and perhaps defense side. But would love to get your thoughts on how your customers are thinking about some of the (59:41) and some of the new labor \u2013 newer regulations that might come out. You guys outsource quite a bit really \u2013 well, not outsource, but have centers outside of the U.S., which are pretty effective and competitive. So I would love to get your initial thoughts on this. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, look, I think it's way too early to try and figure out all of this. There's a lot of things that have been thrown about as it relates to potential tax-related activities. I guess the way I would characterize it, Tahira, is that I do believe, if anything, it's a net positive. If you look at one of the items in isolation, perhaps it goes one direction. But I think collectively, the all-in kind of view that we have at this point in time is that it's going to be incrementally positive. How much? That is the case. Who knows? But that would be our view at this particular point in time. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. I guess my first one is for Kevin. We just noticed that the unbilleds were up pretty materially I guess quarter-over-quarter. Is there anything there that we should be aware of in terms of projects that are notable that are driving that? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: No. I don't think so. Andy, I do \u2013 look, as we track our receivables and what not, we are continuing to do a really good job in reducing our over dues and our aging of our receivables is improving over time as opposed to not. And we do include the non-billeds in that calculation. So, we're actually feeling \u2013 we're not perfect. There are some things that we always need to be focusing on. But overall, we're pleased with the progress we continue to make. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. And then, I guess, my second question is on M&A. And you guys talked about some of the characteristics and even some of the markets that you'd be prioritizing at the Analyst Day. As you stand here today, can you just talk about the robustness of the pipeline? Maybe if you can give us some context about some of the size of the deals that you're looking at? Do you feel like the environment is conducive, in other words, to doing some larger scale M&A, especially considering the valuations that we've seen run in the sector? I'd like to get your perspectives on that. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, we shut down our M&A process during the restructuring period as we focused on the things we needed to improve the company and develop or transform the core strategy. But over the last several months, we've rebuilt our internal M&A process and we have a full-time leader, Jeff Goldfarb, who runs the M&A process and a team in place both corporately and across the lines of business. And so, there has been an increased activity in the company around following the strategy development starting to look at what's consistent with that strategy we presented in December. And there's a lot of interesting assets out there, both (01:03:11), small bolt-on opportunities, I'd say especially in Aerospace & Technology and Buildings & Infrastructure. But, of course, there is some things that we're starting to look at that could be larger in size. But of course, we really need to understand how they fit with both our strategy, our margin, return expectations. And so, a lot going on in the company and really not much more to talk about other than that at this stage. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Good morning, gentlemen. Kevin, just making sure your thoughts on bidding expense and it sounds like you're making investments to take advantage of this year to show the growth over the next handful of years. Do you see an year-over-year increase in the amount spending on winning new work and has the restructuring into the lines of business helped with that process and maybe you make that process more efficient from an expense standpoint? Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Mike. Look, two things. One, there are some instances where we're suggesting that we want to increase our kind of bid cost. But, what's really happening more so than that is we're focusing more on where we believe the margin and the opportunities are that allow us to profitably grow going forward. So, we're being much more effective in terms of how we're spending our bid dollars in the belief that we're going to be able to have a greater return base as the same numbers. And so, there isn't significant increases due to that fact and the preliminary successes that we're seeing is certainly indicating that that can happen. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Excellent, Kevin. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Morning, guys. My first question is just on the guidance, more of a cleanup question. What are your assumptions on corporate expense tax and maybe cash flow deployment? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: We've talked about the tax kind of being approaching the low 30s for the full year. That's been our number. We're not changing that expectation. So, our plan is still in place as it relates to that. Corporate expenses are relatively stable. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And do you assume much of buyback or just more similar to what we've been seeing recently? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I would say that in Q1, it was a little bit lower than normal because we have a process whereby we pulse it depending upon current trends of the share price. And as you recall in Q1, we had some few periods of time where we were over $60 and we weren't in the market at that point in time. So, probably a little lighter in Q1 than where we would expect to be going forward. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And my question is more on just backlog versus looking and focusing on maximizing margin. I guess looking at your statements at the Analyst Day last conference call, you sounded pretty positive on growing new awards, markets seems to have stabilized on the commodity side. Do you find it difficult to grow backlog while making sure that your gross margin is going up? So, is there a dynamic of you maybe kind of not losing market share, but exiting certain contracts and that will continue to be dragged into 2017. I mean, I know you provided positive guidance for the second half, but how do you see that trade-off playing, kind of impacting your backlog going forward? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. I think the \u2013 look, all those things are items that we're very focused on and want to make sure we manage correctly. Clearly, when you shift from a multiyear cost restructuring culture in the company to one that is now the strong message of growth and the focus and priority, that doesn't happen with a snap of the fingers, it takes a few months, a few quarters to build that momentum. That started around the Investor Day. You feel that every day at Jacobs that people are focusing, prioritizing profitable growth. And the word profitable is always in front of the word growth and I think that's a big change from the past, recent past. And so, I'm not \u2013 I don't really \u2013 we don't have concerns about market share because the key markets that we talked about in our strategy, we feel very capable today of protecting and growing with the teams that we have, where I think we're doing an excellent job in building talent. I'd say aviation is a prime example where in a very short period of time as our teams projected and that being one of the highest priority markets that provide good growth dynamics, we've significantly added world-class talent. We're winning, it feels like all the programs that we should win. Knock on wood, it's been a string of successes and we have several more in front of us. So \u2013 and I think the major challenge is just to make sure culturally all 54,000 of our resources understand that it's now all about profitable growth while maintaining the success that we had in building efficiency and driving those specific \u2013 transform the core initiatives that are underway and strengthening the foundation. So, I'd say that's the way I summarize it. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on your announcement of Connected Enterprise. Kind of what's the pay-off on the investment? Is it a new end market where you'll look to grow your, I guess, backlog or is it just more of your being able to execute projects better and being able to kind of move some of the work around your different regional offices? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Look, the Jacobs Connected Enterprise is really building off of a lot of what our Aerospace & Technology business is all about and benefiting from the add-on investments that were made over the last couple of years. The Van Dyke acquisition that brought cyber securities strength to us, the ION investment and several other initiatives, as well as talent that's been brought in by the Aerospace & Technology Group is now being extended across the other three lines of business. And that's something that we hadn't done in the past. And all of our clients, whether it's oil and gas, pharma, mining, they're looking for state-of-the-art digitalization techniques, Internet of Things, and really driving productivity and innovation into their projects. And we bring that suite of offering via the Jacobs Connected Enterprise, I think, in a very unique and differentiated way that is building momentum rapidly. And so, it really was all about taking that into the other three lines of business, and there's great momentum being built. And so, it's really not about creating a separate business line, but more around gaining more share of the market as a result of this added offering. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you so much. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Anita, perhaps we can take two more. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. You've been pulling down the depreciation expense pretty consistently over the last several quarters and that's definitely helped your margins. So, can you speak to how sustainable that continued reduction can be going forward? And how should we think about that line item after restructuring is all done? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Chad, I think it's clear that what's going on there is part and parcel to our restructuring and streamlining of our fixed asset base specifically as it relates to our office configuration. So, we are \u2013 we're not planning once we kind of do this restructuring and finalize up and start adding back offices all over the place. So, I think ultimately, we believe that we're going to be able to have a disciplined approach to our incremental investments after the restructuring such that we are better able to leverage our existing infrastructure without significant additional CapEx. Could there be CapEx now and again associated with key initiatives? Absolutely. But that's not our intent. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And can you also provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in your UK business? How did it fare in the first quarter, and what sort of visibility do you have over these next 9 to 12 months and maybe you can break it out between what you're seeing on the private side versus the public side? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Our UK business, which a big part of it is our Building & Infrastructure business as well as the nuclear business that cuts across both B&I and A&T, has been pretty steady. The whole Brexit, post-Brexit issues and concerns are there. There's been a few delays caused by that. But generally projects are moving forward, especially the areas that we're involved in around rail and highways, nuclear, et cetera. And we're pleased to hear that there's some projections for some steady growth on GDP being projected coming out of the latest estimate. So, all in all it's been steady for us and we don't see any material issue so far associated with some of the turmoil going on with what's going on between the UK and Europe. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's all for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. The bump in professional services backlog specifically, is that spread across the platform or focused in any segment? Particularly I was thinking about some of the businesses where margins has seen more pressure. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. It's really across the board. When I look at the backlog sequentially, PMC, professional services was up in the first quarter versus fourth quarter. Building & Infrastructure was up. Our Life Sciences business, for example, which we told you was hard hit with that cancellation, the engineering services or professional services is actually up in the first quarter versus fourth quarter in spite of that. The rest of our Industrial business is up and our Aerospace & Technology business very modestly up. So, it's across the board when you look at the professional services, engineering service side. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: What's also interesting to note is that as it relate to the foreign exchange changes on the professional service, Steve talked about the consolidated. On professional service, I think about 80%, 90% of the foreign exchange sequentially versus a year ago was because of the professional services piece. So, if you take that into account, the professional services versus year ago is even stronger and it's broad based. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, in Industrial in the project cancellation, you seem very optimistic about Life Sciences, so I assume this is more of a customer specific issue. But I was more curious if this could actually provide you the opportunity to fill the void with higher margin work versus what you might have previously recognized with this project? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, I wouldn't necessarily conclude that the project that got canceled was not higher margin work. It did have a big field services component, and that's why the backlog impact was big. But we were excited about the engineering service side of it. And as you said, unfortunately, it was the client's strategic decision to not move forward with their expansion associated with some drug trials, et cetera. But the work that we're going after where it meets our margin criteria, where there's a good pipeline as I talked about whether some of those are going to hit by the end of this second quarter or will roll into the third quarter, of course, is the question. But we're pretty positive about both the backlog impact and margin impact for our Life Sciences business. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, perhaps I think there's just one more in the queue. Let's go ahead and take that call. Operator : Our next question comes from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of quick questions. How do we think about the focus on drug prices or reducing drug prices? Do you think this will adversely or negatively impact Jacobs' Life Science business? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Could you \u2013 we heard you towards the end, but could you repeat the question please? Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I'm sorry. I said, do you think the increased focus on drug prices or reducing drug prices will adversely or negatively impact Jacobs' Life Science business. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Again, it's hard for us to say because we don't want to portray that we understand our clients' decisions and the way they look at it to the way they do. But I would say that we haven't seen that concern too much. I mean there is some near-term concern going on around the whole Trump administration and what's going on with regard to a lot of the production message comes from these overseas plants moving into the U.S. and will that cause any issues or delays. But, at the end of the day, our clients were in the tail end of some very important bids. Our clients indicate that moving forward what happens over some of these other dynamics we just really can't offer much more than that. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I think that only other comment to make, Sameer, on this issue is that if you think about their mix of spend to try and get things to market, the CapEx is not necessarily the biggest percentage of spend. So, ultimately, the drivers of getting the returns they want is really trying to figure out how to get it through the regulatory process, not necessarily the CapEx. Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Okay. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you for calling in, and I appreciate your interest and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Again, this presentation can be found on our Investor Relations website, located at www.jacobs.com. Please now turn to slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with some comments on our results for the quarter, followed by a summary of backlog and market conditions for each of our four lines of business. I will then provide some more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics and results for each LOB. I will continue with some comments on our restructuring initiative and capital allocation, after which, Steve will finish with some closing remarks. We will then open it up for some questions. With that, I will now pass it over to Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call. Before I discuss our results, I'd like to acknowledge a significant safety excellence milestone at Jacobs. This month marks the 10th anniversary of Jacobs BeyondZero and our unquestionable commitment to safety excellence. Our relentless drive to achieve world-class safety performance is stronger than ever. So, it's with great pride to report that our year-to-date total recordable incident rate stands at an industry-leading 0.17. And last week, we continued our tradition of participating in the industry-wide Global Safety Week, which drove further engagement with our employees, customers and local communities on safety awareness and a commitment to further improvement. And now, a few opening comments regarding our second quarter. I'm very pleased with the significant progress we're making on the new strategy we presented at last December's Investor Day, which established the blueprint to transform Jacobs and drive profitable growth. Halfway through the first fiscal year of our multiyear strategic plan, we're measurably delivering on our commitment to realign our revenue portfolio, shed unprofitable business and drive to a higher value-added mix of projects and programs and demonstrating the early phases of achieving profitable growth. In the second quarter, this was evident by the significant increase in both gross margin and operating profit margin across the company. Specifically, adjusted gross margin reached 19% in the quarter, a significant jump from the 16% gross margin reported a year ago. This higher quality of earnings performance is due primarily to a combination of improved operational execution and a more value-added mix of business. Let me also make some additional comments regarding our top line results. The sequential fall in revenue burn was driven primarily by a drop in low-margin field services revenue. This decline was almost entirely related to our oil and gas exposure and caused by several of our backlogged EPC chemical projects with large field-related activities transitioning to the procurement and construction phases a bit later than we anticipated. Therefore, we expect field services revenue burn to rebound in the second half of this fiscal year and at higher margins than historical levels. In contrast, our high value professional services revenue was flat versus prior quarter consistent with our previous guidance. As such, we believe the more important trend is gross profit, which showed a sequential increase in the second quarter. On the cost side, we've continued to successfully drive productivity with adjusted SG&A cost down $22 million versus a year ago quarter, and now down $36 million year-to-date. As a result of both the margin improvement and cost efficiency, second quarter adjusted operating profit of $140 million, improved by $18.4 million versus the same period last year and on an adjusted operating profit margin basis, an increase of 165 basis points versus last year's second quarter. Overall, this led to a solid second quarter adjusted net earnings performance of $0.78 per share, which is up $0.03 per share over last year's second quarter. Looking forward, I'm also very pleased with our win rate momentum and growth prospects. Year-to-date sales bookings increased 6% versus last year and our total revenue in backlog of $18.5 billion is up on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. And even more encouraging is that the gross margin profile of our backlog is also up by approximately 100 basis points versus last year, indicating that we're continuing to execute on our new strategy to shift to a higher value-added portfolio to deliver profitable growth. We also continued to demonstrate solid cash flow and deployed capital consistent with our new corporate strategy in the second quarter. We purchased $51 million of shares during the quarter. We paid out $18 million in dividends and we completed a strategic Building & Infrastructure bolt-on acquisition, Aquenta Consulting, to strengthen our PMCM capabilities in Australia, New Zealand and across the Asia Pacific region. Moving to slide 5, on the back of strong sales bookings in both our Aerospace & Technology and Building & Infrastructure lines of business, total Jacobs revenue in backlog grew from $18.2 billion at the end of last year's second quarter to nearly $18.5 billion this most recent period. On a sequential basis, it's the same positive trend as our backlog is up more than $300 million versus prior quarter. Importantly, the higher value professional services component of our backlog continued to increase and has reached the highest level since the early part of fiscal year 2015. At $12.4 billion, our professional service backlog is $1 billion higher than a year ago quarter. We're also very pleased that the gross profit in our backlog has continued to increase and now stands as a percent of revenue approximately 100 basis points higher than a year ago period. We believe the positive growth in our backlog mix and margin are a direct result of our more disciplined sales focus and approach of targeting higher value work, and we're excited about the continuing potential growth prospects across the globe. I will now provide some additional commentary on each business over the next few slides. I'm now on slide 6. As a result of a very strong sales quarter, our Aerospace & Technology backlog increased significantly by $355 million to $5.5 billion and is up over $600 million versus the same period last year. And in addition, it is important to note that there is more than $400 million of additional wins that have not been placed into backlog due to the increasingly routine protests that are occurring during the awards of government contracts. The largest example of a recent sales win that has yet to be put in backlog is a very significant multiyear IT services contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command that is going through the protest process. We're confident that there'll be a favorable outcome and we're expecting that this will be added to our backlog soon. Our key programs continue to enjoy stable funding, including the Trump Administration's proposed Skinny Budget. Of particular note is the bipartisan congressional support for NASA's SLS and Orion programs, which underpin a significant portion of our work for the agency. While the longer-term implications of Brexit continue to be uncertain, there have been no negative implications to our UK business. Spending remains steady in the private sector, including the telecom industry, R&D facilities for automotive, and in the UK nuclear sector. Our win of the design build of an aero/acoustic wind tunnel for Honda highlights the continuing strength of our diversity. And our position in UK Nuclear New Build remains strong and our confidence in the market is high despite the near-term funding uncertainty for new gens program due to the Westinghouse bankruptcy. As we've discussed on previous calls, a majority of our base work is in programs of high national priority, including for defense and security programs. Our associated wins with the U.S. Air Force TRANSCOM and the U.S. Army Electronic Proving Ground highlight the stability of our portfolio. Our new business pipeline remains extremely robust with full funding of related programs expected. The one notable headwind is in the UK, where government funding reductions are impacting the Atomic Weapons Establishment where we are an equity partner. This is a key contributor to the second quarter year-over-year decline in operating profit in the A&T line of business. However, with the significant increase in sales bookings year-to-date and the continuing strength of our new business pipeline, our Aerospace & Technology line of business is well-positioned to both grow top line revenue and drive sequential quarterly profit improvement in the second half of this fiscal year. Moving to slide 7, our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business is also on a growth track, with another solid sales quarter and finishing with a strong backlog of $5.3 billion. This represents a $119 million increase sequentially and a significant $431 million increase versus a year ago. Our B&I backlog has now grown for six straight quarters, a testament to our sales team's targeted focus to capitalize on the positive dynamics we're experiencing across global Buildings & Infrastructure market. In our buildings sector, we're experiencing an uptick from a variety of subsectors and are pleased to announce one of our largest building design wins of the year, the expansion of the University of Texas School of Engineering. Other key wins include a multiyear professional services framework from Manchester City Council and Project Design Delivery Award for a large scale urban development in Western Melbourne. We're also experiencing strong growth in our program in construction management services, such as awards for the FBI Central Records Complex as well as for three U.S. Federal Courthouse projects. Our K-12 market leadership was further strengthened with an award from the El Paso Independent School District, one of the largest programs in the county's history. In the water and environmental services sector, we continue to utilize our technical expertise and market leadership position in the UK to provide integrated solutions to water clients globally as evidenced by recent awards for Roads and Maritime Services in New South Wales and the Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link in Sydney. Moving to infrastructure, in Australia, overall market conditions are robust. Infrastructure Australia recently updated their high priority list of major projects over the next 15 years, totaling over $60 billion. This represents the highest number of approved projects in the country's history. New Zealand is also growing as the country moves into a significant transportation planning phase for its major infrastructure corridors. Our acquisition of Aquenta Consulting is going very well. We have achieved all of our near-term milestones and are already seeing increased client opportunities and awards throughout our expanded portfolio. In the U.S., Federal Highway opportunities are increasing with particularly strong government spending in Texas and California. Rail and transit spending continues to be positive across key markets. Recent wins include significant contracts for the Georgia Department of Transportation and the PennDOT Traffic Management project. In the UK, approvals were recently granted for the High Speed 2 rail program, and we also won a design services and collaborative delivery framework for the Highways England Smart Motorways program. Our global aviation sector continues to be strong, and we're successfully delivering on several large scale programs. We recently won a key award for major expansions at the Denver International Airport. And we've strengthened our position in the UK, supporting London Heathrow's third runway expansion. So, in summary, for Buildings & Infrastructure, we're clearly seeing significant benefits of the new line of business structure put in place last year. This includes stronger collaboration across regions on major prospects, while leveraging and connecting global subject matter experts to win local opportunities, all in all contributing to positive growth momentum. So, now, moving to slide 8, our Industrial line of business, the revenue in backlog at $2.4 billion stabilized versus prior quarter. However, as previously discussed, our Industrial backlog remains down versus last year due primarily to significant revenue burn on two large EPCM life sciences projects. The majority of this was passed through subcontractor revenue and consequently carried little to no margin. More importantly, the gross profit and margin in our Industrial backlog is up versus both last year and sequentially. This is as a result of a much higher value mix of recent sales bookings in this line of business. As we look forward, our life sciences business continues to be strong, and we're pursuing several key client opportunities, especially in gene therapy. However, there is some uncertainty on timing of these opportunities, driven by the changing U.S. geopolitical landscape. Our new life sciences strategy to provide end-to-end solutions and expand geographically, including commissioning, qualification and validation continues to be an attractive opportunity. We had several sustaining capital wins this quarter, helping balance out our project portfolio and further demonstrating progress on our stated growth strategy. The mining sector is showing modest signs of recovery as certain commodity prices have started to move up, particularly in copper. Projects deferred during the downturn are now restarting in early study phases. Assuming commodity price gains hold, we expect spending to increase early next year. Based on typical project sequencing, the mining recovery should also translate into growth opportunities for our Chemetics technology offering. Consumer goods and manufacturing spend is steady. Based on our subject matter expertise and strong relationships, we're capturing large expansion projects that are moving forward, including a recent award of a significant specialty chemical project for a confidential client. During the next two quarters, we also anticipate an increase in small capital and sustaining service projects as annual outages and planned maintenance work ramp up. Our global field services backlog was flat sequentially. We were successful in capturing an award for fluoroproducts production facilities for The Chemours Company and for a propanol expansion project for OXEA Corporation. Based on proposal activity, we expect an increase in new awards for long-term sustaining services, framework agreements and contract extensions during the second half of our fiscal year. So, in summary for our Industrial business, as several large EPC projects now move from the feed stage to the field, we expect these to contribute to increased revenue over the next several quarters. And while overall Industrial backlog should remain stable in the second half, we're positioned for growth in 2018, led by life sciences and the mining sector. And turning to slide 9, I'm very pleased to report that our second quarter Petroleum & Chemicals revenue in backlog at $5.3 billion remained relatively flat from the previous quarter and is up $155 million from last year despite the challenging economic environment and the delayed recovery in global oil and gas markets. Also on a positive note, our gross profit in backlog for this line of business trended up in the second quarter. The stability in revenue backlog and strengthening of margin are a result of our strong focus to improve our clients' capital efficiency and sustainment of their assets, as well as our improving momentum in the execution on the new P&C business transformation strategy. In our upstream segment, despite OPEC-led efforts to rebalance excess global supplies, crude oil inventories are still high and price uncertainty remains. Against this environment, a number of integrated majors have recently announced the divestiture of the Canadian oil sand assets. We see these oil sands consolidations as opportunities to help clients better integrate assets to drive efficiencies and scale. Meanwhile, U.S. rig counts continue to rise and increase in production particularly in Texas and North Dakota, is outgrowing current pipeline capacity and storage. We therefore expect to see development opportunities in U.S. pipeline and midstream infrastructure like our recent greenfield gas processing plant win in the second quarter. LNG bunkering infrastructure requirements are also forecast to grow to support an increase in LNG fuel ships, (20:19) with new facilities already under development across several continents. We continue to target infrastructure, offsites, utilities and jetty modification opportunities associated with the second wave of liquefaction projects. In our downstream segment, many Middle East producers have selectively cut production of heavier oil grades and are increasingly seeking joint venture projects with crude buyers in Asia. We expect a number of emerging opportunities as these markets rebalance. Meanwhile, the ability to export diesel and gasoline continues to benefit the U.S. refining industry, though clients remain cautious on CapEx. We're assisting U.S. producers to evaluate feedstock conversions to value-added chemical options. While the U.S. shale revolution and resurging make in America campaign by President Trump may support a further resurgence on U.S. petrochemical production, considerable uncertainty remains around what steps the government will ultimately take to further support and accelerate U.S. growth. And globally, we're expecting complex refineries to benefit from new MARPOL specifications for low-sulfur bunker fuels starting in 2020. We're also targeting several refining opportunities to optimize existing facilities for efficiency and naphtha processing from increasing light oil production. For the quarter, our sales team was successful in a number of downstream bids, including a world-scale polyethylene project and a U.S. Gulf Coast polyolefin project. Additionally, we were successful in winning the ONE Gas platform decomplexing project in the North Sea. And consistent with our strategy projections, global growth continues to be forecasted for the petrochemicals sector. We're targeting and we believe we're well-positioned to win several medium and large-sized chemical derivative prospects across the globe. So, overall, we're very pleased to see our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog stabilizing in what's been a challenging environment. And as we move into the execution phase on several EPC projects, we're optimistic of second half revenue growth and positive momentum into 2018. So, Kevin, back to you. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. And turning to slide 10, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. While I will provide more detail on restructuring in a later slide in the presentation, our restructuring cost for the quarter included the bulk of the final cost of our 2015 restructuring, plus an additional charge associated with a strategic realignment of our Europe, UK and Middle East regional operations related to our strategy to focus on a more profitable growth agenda. As a result of these costs, our GAAP EPS was down $0.13 to $0.41 per share versus the year ago period. However, when the cost associated with the 2015 restructuring and strategic changes in the Europe, UK and Middle East region are excluded, our adjusted earnings per share was, in fact, up 4% versus the year ago quarter to $0.78 per share. Turning to revenues, as already noted by Steve, we continue to be impacted by our oil and gas-related activities and specifically our field services revenue during the quarter. To better understand our revenue trends, I will focus on the sequential change in our revenue, given that it is more relevant to better understand how revenues will trend through the balance of the year. While Steve talked about this early in the call, I would like to point to the right side of the slide where we specifically highlight the change in revenue in Q2 versus Q1. It is noteworthy that the professional services revenue was indeed stable in Q2 when compared to Q1. And as a result, the sequential drop in revenue was almost exclusively driven by a decline in field services. This is due to the short-term delay in the ramp-up of certain backlog P&C projects from professional services work to field work. And while this change in the revenue mix between professional and field services helped improve our gross margin in the quarter, it is not the primary story behind the sequential improvement in gross margin performance in the quarter to 19% or an improvement of 260 basis points on a sequential basis. Importantly, approximately two-thirds of this margin increase was supported by improved underlying performance, driven by project execution, continued focus on cost efficiencies and our new strategic focus on reorienting our portfolio to higher margin business. This is a clear indication that our profitable growth strategy is continuing to gain traction. In fact, it is interesting to note that the Q2 gross margin level represents the highest unit gross margin for the company in over 15 years. Finally, the other one-third of the gross margin improvement was driven by the revenue mix of professional versus field services. It should also be noted that this field service mix benefit should be considered somewhat short-term in nature, given that we expect our field service business to gain momentum going forward through the balance of the year. Regarding backlog and as previously noted by Steve, revenue in backlog also grew in the quarter to $18.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.02 versus the trailing 12-month period, up from 0.94 in the year ago period. Specifically, our book-to-bill numbers were even stronger for the B&I business and our Aerospace & Technology business. So, when noting the fact that we are growing both revenue and gross margin in backlog quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, it is clear that our profitable growth strategy is gaining momentum. Simply put, our revenue in backlog is growing sequentially and year-over-year, our gross margin percentage and absolute gross profit dollars in backlog are both growing sequentially and year-over-year, and finally, our reported gross profit burn is gaining momentum, both versus the year ago period and the previous quarter. Sequentially, the current quarter actually showed a $21 million gross profit improvement from Q1. On revenues that actually were down 9%. Completing our review of the P&L, our SG&A costs also continue to trend positively and are down a further $6 million versus year ago or down $22 million on an adjusted basis, and are now down a total of $36 million year-to-date. This continued reduction in fixed cost when combined with our gross margin improvement has led to an increased adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter sequentially and year-over-year, finishing at just over 6% in the quarter. This equates to $140 million in adjusted operating profit, an increase of $18.4 million versus our fiscal 2016 second quarter. Lastly, efforts to improve cash flows continued during the quarter, resulting in a working capital decrease of 30% versus the year ago quarter with DSOs also down from the prior year period, decreasing two days versus the fiscal year 2016 second quarter. As a consequence, Jacobs continues to be in a strong net cash position of $340 million. Moving to slide 11, given our strong consolidated financial metrics, it's not surprising to see that the Q2 operating profit levels continued to trend strongly positive for three of our four lines of business. Our A&T group was the only line of business to see a decrease in operating profit versus the year ago quarter as the impact of several rebid losses that we have previously disclosed continued to weigh on revenues for the group. In addition, our profits associated with our AWE JV in the UK decreased, given lower volume. As a result, our operating profit for A&T decreased by 18% versus the year ago quarter to $45 million. Importantly, however, we see our A&T business, both revenue and profit, gaining momentum in the second half, given our strong backlog that has been developed by the team. Our B&I business saw 1% improvement in revenue versus the year ago quarter and an improved margin, driven by solid performance in our PMCM work and a strong project execution that resulted in additional fee recognition in the quarter, both of which when combined more than offset an additional write-down associated with a large project. As a result, operating profit grew 3.6% versus the year ago period and operating profit margin increased 18 basis points to 7.5%. You will note that the margin rebounded from Q1 levels as we have previously projected. The Industrial line of business, meanwhile, saw a 23% decrease in revenues versus the year ago quarter, driven in part by the recent completion of several projects and prior to the mobilization on several new field services projects that we have already discussed. Regardless, overall operating profit for the group improved versus the fiscal year 2016 second quarter due to the year ago period being impacted by a litigation settlement and customer bankruptcy. Consequently, operating profit for the group increased by 94% versus the year ago quarter to $24 million and operating profit margin rose a significant 227 basis points to 4.1%. Finally, our P&C line of business continued to experience revenue weakness due to cyclical softness in the industry, finishing down versus both last quarter and last year primarily again driven by the lower field service activity previously discussed. At the OP (30:28) level, however, the impact of the reduction in revenue was more than offset by, one, a one-time benefit associated with the restructuring of our P&C-related Indian welfare trust program of $9.9 million and our focus on improving margin mix and project execution. These combined to support a significant 281-basis point improvement in operating profit margin to 6.4%, both a clear indication of our drive to improve operational performance and target more profitable work. Even when excluding the one-time welfare trust benefit, P&C operating margin still improves 100 basis points versus the year ago quarter to 4.6%. Moving to slide 12, some brief comments on our 2015 restructuring program, which we have substantially completed in Q2, you will note that the cost of the 2015 restructuring are now estimated to total $445 million. While this final level is higher than we previously communicated, the incremental amount was driven largely by our final closeout of the program, which prompted a full review of the lease write-downs incurred to-date. This resulted in a final additional reserve that incorporated our revised estimates of the expected market value of sub-lease income. In addition, as part of our implementation of our new corporate strategy, certain operations in our Europe, UK and Middle East region were restructured to realign the company against a new strategic focus in certain parts of the region, all to drive enhanced profitable growth opportunities. The restructuring in the region resulted in an EPS charge of $0.08 for the quarter. As a result of our updated cost estimates for the 2015 restructuring, our savings estimates have also increased. And we are now forecasting a total annualized ongoing savings of $285 million versus the expected final cost of $445 million. As our program to-date has incurred approximately $430 million in costs, there remain some minor remaining items expected to be charged in the second half of our fiscal year, which largely are surrounding and involve complex multi-office consolidations. The cost of these efforts is not expected to be more than $15 million in total which, to be clear, is included above in the final expected cost. Again, regarding the $30 million of strategic investments that we have previously discussed in our earnings calls, we continue to be on track relative to these investments, having spent approximately 5% against the efforts in the second quarter consistent with our expectation. As a result, the remainder of the strategic investments outlined as part of our strategy is expected to be incurred in Q3 and Q4. So, before turning it back to Steve for his closing comments, some quick comments on slide 13 regarding capital allocation. During the second quarter, we continued to execute against our three-year share buyback program, purchasing 900,000 shares during the quarter for a total of $51 million. We have now spent approximately $234 million of the $500 million buyback authorization repurchasing a total of 4.9 million shares in the process. As previously indicated, we plan to continue to purchase the remaining $266 million of this program in a balanced and measured approach throughout the remainder of the three-year period. In addition, we were excited to pay out our inaugural dividend of $0.15 per share during the most recent quarter and also, just recently declared our second quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share payable on June 16 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 19. We believe our strong financial position continues to serve us well to invest not only in our business and drive our profitable growth strategy, but still providing flexibility to support our buyback program and dividend. To that end, our previously announced acquisition of Aquenta Consulting is going well with the integration plan well on track. With that, let me hand it back over to Steve. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. And turning to the final slide, we're pleased with our progress over the fiscal year-to-date and the significant improvements we're seeing in operational and financial performance. As we continue our shift to profitable growth, we remain vigilant and focused on achieving our three-year strategic objectives. As we review our line of business markets and sales pipeline at quarter end, we're more positive than we were last quarter and certainly since last year. Those markets most significantly impacted by weak commodity prices are beginning to show signs of life, or at the very least, appeared to have stabilized. Conversely, we're seeing strong continued growth in several of our other markets. And we are proactively focusing on those areas and regions exhibiting the best profitable growth prospects. Our outlook for the second half of fiscal year 2017 is for sequential revenue and profit growth with continuing strong underlying operational performance. As such, we remain on track to achieve our previously announced fiscal year's 2017 guidance. However, key to achieving this and our long-term growth objectives will be to continue our relentless focus on winning new profitable business and executing well on our project delivery. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and we will now open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, Kevin. Steve, why did the shift to chemicals field services take longer than expected? Was that just general business confident tied to commodity dynamics? And if so, what indication do you have that those projects are \u2013 will indeed pick up in the second half? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. It's a minor shift. It's probably a little kind of do with the industry, but I'd say more just on the transition from the FEED to the execution phase on some of these EPC projects just went a little slower. But the confidence we have is that we're already in full speed execution as we sit here today. We have sort of our April data behind us. And so, that gives us the confidence that we're going to see sequential improvement in the next couple of quarters related to those post-FEED executions in the procurement and construction phase, as well as some other things on across other business lines. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And in terms of hitting the midpoint of your EPS guidance, I know you just said in your closing comments that you're anticipating a sequential revenue growth. To what extent are you contemplating, is that growth off of the most recent quarter or is it the first half in aggregate? Just kind of wondering if you're thinking about year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year to hit the midpoint of the EPS guidance. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Look, Steven, this is Kevin. We're taking certainly the Q2 numbers and saying we're going to sequentially grow off of those numbers. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. It's Alan Fleming on for Andy today. Kevin, maybe you can just give us a little more color about how to think about the push and pull on gross margin here. I guess the question is, is19% adjusted gross margin a new normal for you guys with professional services backlog the highest it's been in two years. I mean, how does that kind of compare and contrast with how you're thinking about gross margin as the field services does rebound here over the next few quarters? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Sure. Alan, some quick comments. The first point is, 19% is probably not the sustainable number going forward, but I don't want to make that comment without a very clear indication that underlying gross margin trends continue to be quite positive in terms of the wins that we have, our burn that's occurring and so on and so forth. The reason I make that comment is twofold, is that the mix on professional services versus field services will probably kick back more to normal levels in the back half of the year, as Steve just alluded to, the field service business kicks up, and that will take the gross margin down. While we like that business, we like the margin profile associated with that new field service business, which is actually higher than it has been historically. It still is a little bit lower than professional services, so we'll see some dampening. And so, if you kind of go back to my comments about talking about a third \u2013 two-thirds with two-thirds being underlying and one-third being the mix dynamic, we would expect the mix dynamic to kind of go away. And take the rest of the two-thirds might not be exactly sustainable at those levels, but certainly close to that and certainly above our Q1 or certainly year-to-date numbers for our gross margin for the year. So, a continuation in uptick as it relates to our figures. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful, Kevin. And maybe I can switch gears to backlog. Backlog was up sequentially and compared to one of your main competitors, your bookings profile in the quarter looked a lot better. So, I know maybe some of that's due to your more small to midsized project focus and focus on sustaining CapEx. So, we also know that you've reorganized the sales structure of the organization here. So, how much of the backlog growth or stability here? Do you think the market is improving or your market is improving versus your ability to kind of outperform the markets and maybe take share in some of these markets? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I think it's several things. When you look across the whole company, I would say that we're getting clear evidence that our new line of business structure across all four of these businesses are clearly allowing us to leverage global capabilities and to deliver local projects, something we really didn't do as well when we restructured regionally previously. When you look specifically at our line of business like Petroleum & Chemicals, I'd say the fact that we believe we're outperforming the rest of the industry in that particular segment is a combination of the type of projects that we participate in, more in the small and mid-cap sized projects. But also the strategy to focus on downstream, which we're really going after targeting the refining and chemical projects that allow us to have a stable backlog to offset the weakness in upstream. And we are moving into some more prudent risk EPC type projects, larger projects, which I talked about is creating this dynamic of some delayed field services revenue. But it's going to be higher quality field service revenue as we start to move into the second half and into 2018. So, I'd say it's a combination of new structure, some market dynamics like A&T and Building & Infrastructure, but also executing on our new strategy that we shared with all of you a few quarters ago. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Very good, guys. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Anderson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Hi. This is Jamie Anderson on for Jamie Cook. I was just looking for a little bit of clarity on the incremental investment. I know last time we talked, incremental investment was about $0.05 in the quarter. I don't know that we were adjusting it out. It seems like now we are. Could you just kind of clarify that? And then, I guess the implication is that the guide gets reduced $0.10. Is that just because of the revenue burn being a little more than anticipated on the P&C and Industrial business? If you could just help me with the puts and takes on that, that'd be helpful. Thanks. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Jamie, just to be clear, the $0.05 isn't adjusted out. It is incorporated into our operating figures. So, we did just want to make sure that you were clear because it has been a point of discussion in our previous results as to how much is being spent on those strategic investments, some of which are one-time, some of which are incremental investments. Relative to our strategy, that will be sustained longer term. So, to be clear, the $0.05 is in our adjusted figures and not adjusted out. Jamie Anderson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Cool. And then, just as a follow-up, at the Analyst Day, you talked about 15% of the business today is kind of unprofitable, 25% is breakeven. Not assuming that we can kind of get momentum on those, you could pick up anywhere between $50 million to $100 million of op profit improvement. Could you just tell us how those buckets are kind of tracking against your $50 million to $100 million targets? And where do you think we could potentially wind up towards the end of the year, given that backlog looks a little better, these investments could potentially take hold? That would be helpful. Thanks. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Let me start just at a \u2013 kind of at a high-level strategic basis. I think everything we've talked about today, the margin improvement in professional services, up more than 250 basis points year-over-year, even field services when you look at stand-alone field services, the revenue that is in our P&L in the second quarter was up more than 100 basis points on a field services stand-alone comparison. And when you look at our backlog, as I mentioned earlier, the new wins and what's been \u2013 what's in our backlog now is much richer mix of business, about 100 basis points more gross margin as a percent of the revenue and backlog. And so, I think the strategy and some of the dynamics that you're seeing on a temporary decline in revenue, a significant increase in gross margin, quality of the gross margin, is clearly evidence that we're executing early on that strategy to not repeat winning breakeven or a loss-making business, and now winning profitable business and it's contributing to operating profit improvement and a richer backlog going forward. And I'd say, overall, that's the measure that we're on track in the first six months of our three-year strategy to significantly transform the SO (46:46) margin to final operating profit. Jamie Anderson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I'll hop back in queue. Operator : The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you folks can talk about within your Petroleum & Chemicals business, when do you expect year-over-year revenue growth? Obviously, the bookings have been very good and the backlog has been strong based on project cadence, when do you expect that to translate to year-over-year revenue growth. And if you can comment on chemicals specifically, I think that'd be helpful. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, perhaps not talking specifics but ultimately I think, we start to get to a point as we get to the end of this year, the beginning of next where we might be able to see that kind of dynamic occurring. This industry obviously continues to be certainly faced with a more stable but certainly a lower oil price and that continues to impact spend across the board, but I think the way to think about it is probably as we approach near the end of this year we might be able to see those kind of numbers happen. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then, can you comment specifically about what you're seeing in mining, are you starting to see bookings coming through, where inquiry levels, I guess we have started to hear chatter about new projects picking up and I'm wondering if you're seeing that in your business as well, and if it benefited bookings in the quarter at all? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Look the \u2013 our backlog in mining is up year-over-year. A lot of that is driven by the major Rio Tinto win that we started putting on our backlog and are in the field now. But we are clearly now seeing a wave of studies underway. A lot of projects, multi-billion-dollar projects that were shelved are coming back on and we're talking across not only copper but iron ore, lead, zinc, gold, across all kinds of markets and regions where we're seeing some good activity in those study phases in Chile, Peru, Australia, even in certain parts of the Mediterranean on some of the metals. So, I would say, what we're seeing are small initiatives that we're winning that could lead to much bigger CapEx opportunities in 2018 and beyond. And so, the key decision is going to be \u2013 will these mining companies as they're now making better profits decide to pull the trigger and convert these studies to full projects. And if that happens, clearly we're going to see a 2018 and 2019, that's a lot better than the last few years of mining. Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Terrific. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. I guess I wanted to understand some of the margin profile in B&I. Kevin, it sounded like there's some pretty chunky moving parts in there with the write-down and an offset from a strong incentive fee. Can you just gives us the puts and takes, we can kind of get a better sense about what the margin profile is in there? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think if you at historical operating profit margins, the number that ultimately is there is probably not too far off of, let's call it, a normalized level. So, I think, it was positive. There were some additional hits that ultimately offset some of the one-time benefits. So, I think, you're netting to a, let's call it, a pretty stable number. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then I guess just to keep going to you, Kevin, just the cash flow and your balance sheet is strong right now, $340 million of net cash. You're doing the buyback, you're doing the dividend, you did an acquisition, still building cash. So, multiples in the industry are pretty high right now, just in general not just publicly traded, but the companies that have been bought out or taken out as well. Does the acquisition environment in the next 6 months, 12 months, probably stay a little bit more subdued because of those multiples or are you guys as aggressively looking at acquisitions today as you always have been? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So look, I think that we continue to be proactively evaluating opportunities. I will tell you that within the structured approach that we have, we still believe that there continue to be opportunities to add value with some of the deals that we have been looking at. It doesn't mean that we execute against them because bids got to equal ask, but ultimately we do believe there continues to be value-added opportunities and I will tell you that it is very clear and a revision to our historical way of thinking about acquisitions. We're going to get a cash on cash return associated with these deals. So, the rigor of implementation, the rigor of the integration, the rigor associated with what the return on cash is relative to the investment are going to be the drivers to our decisions. And we're still finding an ability to make some value. Does that mean that there might be more limited opportunities given some of the high multiples? Perhaps, but we're still seeing some things that we are excited about. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's fair enough. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Rob Norfleet of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead. Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on EBIT margins, I guess even when I assumed field services revenues are going to be ramping in the second half of the year and I normalized P&C margins for Q3 and Q4. Your operating profit number's going to be bumping up against your three-year goal of 5.8% to 6.3% that you outlined in your Investor Day. So, I guess my question is why should we not think of those as being conservative goals given that we're already at almost the low end that range here in the first half of year one? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, look, we have a strategy that we've outlined and we outlined that six months ago, and ultimately we think that we're making really great progress against that strategy. We'll continue to update you as we work going forward, but we're very pleased with the incremental traction we're gaining on our profitability slate, which is really about ensuring that our portfolio's being reoriented to a more profitable business. So, look, I think if we hit the number sooner, we're not going to stop. So ultimately, the idea is that we believe that we'll continue to drive against the profitable growth agenda, but we're not at this particular point in time going to give you any update as it relates to what the long-term view might look like. Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Great. Thanks. And last question, just can you talk about what your bid pipeline looks like in A&T especially new OE work versus rebid opportunities? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. We \u2013 very consistent with what I said last quarter is that we really shifted from the rebid phase to new opportunities. And we have one of the richest pipelines that we've had in this business in a long time, if not ever. And part of our optimism on this business is not only the pipeline, but a real strategic shift in the way we're bidding for projects and winning them where we're creating more solutions for our clients, allowing us to get higher value because of the value that we're creating for our clients with these new business areas. And the strategy we talked about, weapon sustainment, nuclear as well as some other initiatives and we are on track in going after that. So, overall, it's a much richer pipeline we've ever seen and our winning rate is up over 25% year-to-date versus last year in this business for new bookings. So, the pipeline is good. Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Great. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. And Steve and Kevin, congratulations to your team on a very good quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: First question is given how upbeat and confident you are and clearly we are seeing that now in backlog. Kevin, why would you not take the guidance range up a bit, should we at least assume the lower end of guidance is now looking slightly improbable? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, look, we have not changed, Tahira, the range of our guidance. So, as we get through the course of the year, I would say the downside and the upside probably become a little less likely as we're halfway through the year now. But, ultimately, we think it's appropriate to continue to have that range, and we're feeling good about what the range is that we provided to you. I think the way to think about it, all of the good stuff relative to operating profit, margin and gross margin is really happening, that's great stuff. And I think it's really about, all right, so the backlog, how does it burn? Is it better than the midpoint or on the upside, if it's worse, then we are on the downside. So, look, I think it really is, given the dynamics of certain of the industries and markets we're in, that's really the range of our dynamic, less so about margin, more so about how quickly it will burn. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, Kevin. And I guess a follow-up on the restructuring elements. You always said that you're watchful of macro dynamics and restructuring is like an ongoing process always for you. But assuming no major structural changes in the global economy, albeit at least a point where the restructuring elements start to diminish going forward? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Look, well as always, we always will continue to look at driving our business become better, but I will tell you that at least for the 2015 restructuring, where we now have the identified items and it's just a matter before they get executed. So, I would say, the 2015 restructuring has a couple of items that'll hit us in the back half, but not much. And so the 2015 restructuring is for all intents and purposes done, we'll have some couple of execution items. You know that the other restructuring that we did, which is relative to a realignment of our business, but as it relates to 2015 restructuring, we're done. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much, folks. Operator : The next question comes from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. How should we think about the cadence of the Buildings & Infrastructure segment in the second half of 2017? You're currently running at a low-single-digit revenue growth rate, but your backlog has been at the upper-single-digits for about past couple of quarters. So, there's clearly a delay between the award and the execution. So, first of all, what's driving that? And are you starting to see those headwinds abate? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Let me just talk about the market and our pipeline a bit and maybe Kevin can talk a little just about how it's translating in the near term. But look, the market dynamics are very positive and it's happening globally. If you just start with roads and highways, aging infrastructure, new governments in place almost in all of our major markets. All are coming together to address the pent up demand to accelerate the improvements upgrades on roads and highways and we're seeing more funding certainty. And so, we're very bullish as we look to the next several quarters and into 2018 on that segment. Even funding opportunities and things like our K-12, the education sector where it's a big part of our core market, a lot of bond issues, they're creating funding. Aviation, we've mentioned several times we're in the midst right now of some very important prospects that we believe we're going to be successful on that are going to continue this significant momentum on what we call our winning streak in aviation that is ahead of us. Even things like U.S. courthouses, which many years ago was a big part of our business and there was a lot of activity, we're seeing a resurgence of opportunities in U.S. courthouses. And then, geographic expansion, we're working on some interesting growth opportunities in places like the Middle East, which we should be able to talk about some more over the next few quarters and some platforms for growth in Asia Pacific. So, you put it all together, our diversified portfolio and the market dynamics and our new strategy, as I mentioned before, our line of business strategy where we're now leveraging our global capabilities and subject matter experts and multi-office execution opportunities to go win local opportunity is clearly on an on an accelerated momentum. So, I think, we're bullish on continued backlog growth in this business, and it will translate into revenue growth. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Let me just add real quickly that, yeah, the momentum is building in that business. And look, it builds over time, right, to the point of when the backlog comes in and I would say that we would expect to see some revenue improvements as we go through the back half of the year and hopefully momentum will then continue on into 2018 as it relates to the momentum that Steve was alluding to. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. And then just a question on your other corporate expenses, it looks like it's running at about half the typical run rate if I look back to the past couple of quarters. Just want to understand, is that a new normal, are there any one-time items that I should be aware of? And then just secondly on the cost savings benefit, the incremental cost savings benefit, how should we think about the cadence for the rest of 2017 versus 2018 in terms of the incremental benefit that you realized? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Just a quick comment, it was a little bit lower than normal. We had a reserve that was released in the corporate numbers in the quarter, so that openly took it down from what is the normal historical run rate. So, I think you should still think about the run rate kind of being at the numbers that we've seen historically as it relates to the balance of the year. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, and then on the cost savings? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: On cost savings relative to the corporate numbers? Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, just a cadence of how I should think about the benefits realized between the rest of 2017, 2018. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, look, they will continue to build, obviously. Most of the actions that we've taken have been incurred in 2017 first half. So, those numbers will start to build and the remaining small items probably won't see much of the benefit in this year, but they're minor as it relates to the total. So, by the end of this year, we're at a full run rate of the $285 million in savings. Now, as we have suggested to you when we outlined in our Investor Day, we're going to be now starting to spend some of that money back and specifically that's why we called out the strategic investments, which were approximately $30 million this year. So, you won't see all of that hit the P&L because we're reinvesting back into our profitable growth strategy. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. I'll leave it there. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steven J. Demetriou, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, everyone, for calling in today. We're excited about the positive momentum in executing our strategy, and we're going to stay focused to continue on that path forward. Look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Steve will finish with closing remarks and we'll open the call for questions. With that, I will now pass it over our Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Jon, and welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. Before I discuss our results, I would like to turn to slide 5 and comment on the significant announcement we made last week, the acquisition of CH2M. This strategic investment serves as the beginning of the next exciting chapter in the history of Jacobs and will significantly enhance opportunities in targeted high growth industries and reinforce our drive to be a world premier global design, engineering, construction, operations and maintenance technical services firm. This is a significant step for both companies as we unite our complementary cultures and capabilities, expand our presence around the world and accelerate our profitable growth agenda. The deal is truly transformational and will set a new benchmark for the industry and significantly enhance opportunities for our employees, our clients and our shareholders. The joining of CH2M and Jacobs is a compelling strategic fit for a number of reasons. The complementary capabilities of our two great companies will create an ideal mix of talent and expertise and builds on our common cultures and shared values. Coupled with Jacobs' global platform and long-term client relationships, we will enhance our ability to deliver differentiated services and solutions across key growth industries resulting in business opportunities neither company could create on their own. CH2M further supports our profitable growth agenda and better positions us to deliver on a strategic blueprint and drive more profitable growth across our business. Most importantly, we expect the combined company to drive significant financial benefits and enhance shareholder value. Moving to slide 6. From the onset, leadership at both Jacobs and CH2M established open and dynamic discussions about the potential of combining our two companies and the synergistic opportunities that will result from our complementary capabilities. We conducted extensive due diligence across CH2M's business including a deep focus on their project portfolio and their project delivery capabilities and tool sets. We're confident in our assumptions and forecast of CH2M's profitability. Significant recent profit improvement versus historical performance is primarily associated with two of their key initiatives. One, a portfolio optimization and secondly, a strategic transformation. As it relates to CH2M's portfolio optimization, they've been successful in addressing legacy project issues that were a drag on historical performance by permanently exiting the higher risk power EPC and transportation design build businesses. Enhanced risk mitigation and improved project governance are now in place and we have conservatively factored certain risk parameters into our valuation. As a result, we believe we're acquiring a very attractive business portfolio with a similar risk profile to Jacobs. With regard to their transformation, CH2M prioritized higher value core customers, and focused on a restructuring to reduce cost and enhance client-centric offerings. As their transformation is gaining traction, CH2M is demonstrating a significant increase in sales and profitability with year to date new gross profit awards up 25% and pro forma trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $324 million, up 30% from prior 12 month period. And while their recent cost restructuring initiative has been successfully completed, there is still much more to do, and therefore we are acquiring CH2M at a very opportune time. We have assigned senior executives from both organizations to co-lead our integration management office, the IMO, on a full time basis. We also engaged an external world-leading consulting firm with significant transformational integration experience and together with the IMO, are developing a roadmap to ensure accountability, transparency and a rigorous integration plan. I'll chair an executive integration steering committee and our Board of Directors will be highly engaged. The $150 million of cost synergy opportunities have jointly been developed with CH2M leaders during the due diligence. Over the past two years at Jacobs, our leadership has delivered cost savings in excess of $285 million by successfully rightsizing and consolidating over 90 offices and strategically realigning into four global lines of business. These results demonstrate our ability to execute and successfully deliver on our promise to improve margins, profits and enhance shareholder returns. And so as it relates to the CH2M acquisition, we're confident in our ability to successfully deliver the targeted cost synergies and drive further upside revenue synergies. Ultimately, we believe this transaction is a win-win for all stakeholders. The combined businesses of CH2M and Jacobs will create a premier global solutions provider with the capabilities to deliver and enhanced differentiated value proposition for our clients and strengthen our portfolio with high quality project expertise. Moving to slide 7 and a few comments regarding our third quarter performance. We are now three quarters into the first fiscal year of our multi-year strategy and we continue to see evidence across the organization that we are delivering on our commitment to improve the company through a continued realignment of our revenue portfolio, reductions in unprofitable business and strong improvements to both gross margins and operating profit margins. Positively in the third quarter, we saw a 9% increase in sequential adjusted revenue from prior quarter driven by a 16% increase in field services work in our Industrial and Petroleum & Chemicals businesses and a greater than 4% increase in overall professional services revenue. We continue to see improvements in adjusted gross profit at $461 million. This increased by $20 million sequentially and up $9 million versus the year ago quarter. Meanwhile, adjusted gross margin remains strong at 18.3%, a 155 basis point increase year over year. This is indicative of our ability to drive and sustain higher margins through a combination of improved operational execution and a focus on more value-added business. And while we did see an increase in adjusted SG&A costs for the quarter, as a percent of revenue, this was lower by approximately 16 basis points and remained down by $24 million on a year to date basis. As a result of our margin improvement and cost efficiency drive, third quarter adjusted operating profit was $139 million and resulted in a solid third quarter adjusted net earnings of $0.79 per share, an increase of $0.01 per share both sequentially and year over year. Moving to slide 8. Our backlog reached $18.6 billion at quarter end. This represents a $100 million sequential increase and a more than $230 million improvement year over year. We saw backlog growth in three of our four lines of business, two of which, Aerospace & Technology and Buildings & Infrastructure are our highest margin, highest growth industries, while also increasing our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog in spite of continued industry headwinds. Just as importantly, our higher value professional services work in backlog continued to trend higher, reaching $12.6 billion at quarter end, the largest in nine quarters. This is a sequential increase of almost $300 million and over $700 million higher than the year-ago quarter and supports our continued efforts to improve underlying gross profit and margins in our backlog. As a consequence of this mix, and also our sales drive to target higher margin work, the quality of our backlog continued to improve, and gross margins are up over 200 basis points versus the year-ago quarter and more than 100 basis points sequentially. These improvements demonstrate our more disciplined sales focus and ability to win higher value work. We remain excited about the continuing potential growth prospects across each of our four lines of business, which I'll now move into in greater detail starting with Aerospace & Technology on the next slide. On slide 9, Aerospace & Technology backlog increased sequentially to $5.6 billion and is up over $400 million versus the year-ago quarter. Of note is that our third quarter backlog continues to exclude $600 million of awarded government contracts under protest. We remain optimistic that we will be successful in the protest process and book these into our backlog soon. Our sales focus on improving unit margins is also delivering results, as our Aerospace & Technology backlog gross margins are up by approximately 100 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. This recent trend of strong sales results is producing momentum in this line of business, and I'm pleased that the P&L revenue and net operating profit are both up sequentially. During the quarter, we had two important wins that are not included in our backlog numbers and that organically advanced our stated strategy of growth in the nuclear sector. The first is the management and operations contract at the Nevada National Security Site where we are a major equity partner in the JV formed to execute the work. I'm delighted to note that the competitor protest on this win have recently been withdrawn and we will book this into backlog in the fourth quarter and immediately begin transitioning the contract. The second strategic award is a contract to remediate radiological contamination at the Shallow Land Disposal Area site. While this is still under protest, we remain optimistic we will ultimately execute this important strategic win. Our key government programs continue to receive stable funding, which is projected to hold steady despite political uncertainty in both the United States and Great Britain. Our win of the Ford rolling road wind tunnel project this quarter speaks to the diversity of our Aerospace & Technology portfolio. Due to our differentiated delivery model, our series of wins this year on these sorts of projects are among our highest margin projects and the associated pipeline remains robust. Moving to slide 10. Our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business also continues to show strength with another strong sales quarter driving bookings up 18% year over year. Although backlog at quarter end appears flat when rounded, it's in fact up $75 million sequentially, increased by $500 million year over year, representing our seventh straight quarter of Buildings & Infrastructure backlog growth. In the building sector, increasing investments in the federal healthcare and education sectors present significant opportunities across the U.S. In particular, the western U.S. continues to strengthen with large scale design, design build and PM/CM opportunities throughout the region. We're also seeing strong corporate growth in Texas. In Europe, the corporate sector for buildings is also picking up momentum. Despite certain political uncertainty within the UK, we continue to see positive opportunities and spending plans by our major clients. Back in the U.S., a recent strategic building award of note was our selection as the prime architect for the University of Texas at Austin Energy Engineering Building. The global infrastructure sector also continues to present many opportunities, particularly, within transportation where commitment and spending from governments in the U.S., the UK, and Asia-Pacific is robust. Investment in U.S. transportation programs is accelerating in California, Texas, and in the Southeast, all areas where Jacobs is well established. The Australia federal government has also announced significant investments in infrastructure, with AUD 75 billion identified for its infrastructure funding over the next decade. Similarly, the New Zealand government is forecasting an increase in infrastructure investments in excess of NZD 30 billion over the next four years. In the UK, there continues to be cost pressures and the drive for increased value for money within the rail sector. However, the UK National Infrastructure Commission is very supportive of certain headline projects including HS2 for Phase 1 and 2, HS3 to underpin the Northern Powerhouse, Crossrail 2 and the third runway at London's Heathrow Airport, which are all driving Jacobs' opportunities. In aviation, we're seeing increased opportunities globally with both traditional and alternative delivery model approaches. We have recently been selected as the program manager for a significant contract involving two major airport redevelopments. Some recent key transportation wins include the New Zealand Transport Agency's Northern Corridor improvements project, the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway concept design for Highways England and a 10-year contract from PennDOT to design a long-range multiple modal transportation management solution for Interstate 76 in Philadelphia. In summary, our Buildings & Infrastructure business is well positioned for continued growth across all sectors and geographies. Our pipeline of new opportunity has grown nearly 30% year over year, and our sales and project transformations are yielding solid growth. Moving to slide 11. Our Industrial line of business was the only LOB to see a sequential decrease in backlog, finishing at $2.2 billion, down $200 million from the prior quarter. As mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, the decrease was expected, and driven primarily by significant revenue burn on two large EPCM life sciences projects as they moved into the field. More positively however, gross margins in our Industrial backlog are up more than 350 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, and also up sequentially. In life sciences, we advanced our geographic expansion efforts with significant awards in China, the U.S., Europe and Ireland. Three of these wins were for long-term sustaining capital contracts, and move us toward a more balanced project mix and reliable income stream to help offset the industry's cyclicality. In mining and minerals, we are seeing incremental signs of recovery in Australia and South America where we have a strong presence and the ability to ramp up quickly. We are building on several iron ore, copper and gold studies, but do not currently anticipate significant spend to restart before late 2018. In our specialty chemicals business, we continue to penetrate the phosphate sector using our Chemetics technology and to expand our Comprimo services. Consumer goods and manufacturing spend meanwhile remained steady. In this space, we're recognized for our ability to drive client value in small capital and sustaining services projects through alliance agreements. In the third quarter, we were awarded a key renewal contract with one of our core alliance partners. We're also seeing opportunities as the Make in India program, devised to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub, gains momentum. As you know, we have significant experienced engineering talent in-country which allows us to take advantage of these opportunities. And in field services, the construction industry in Europe is suffering from the current political climate and the effective slowdowns are weighing on this industry. Even with key sustaining services, construction and construction management wins, our global field services business remains flat. Looking forward, our current Industrial line of business sales performance and pipeline is positioning us for more profitable growth in 2018. And turning to slide 12. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter Petroleum & Chemicals revenue in backlog increased sequentially to $5.4 billion and is up more than $270 million year over year despite continued challenging industry conditions. As with our other lines of business, our Petroleum & Chemicals gross margin in backlog is also higher sequentially and versus the year ago quarter. These margins in backlog are a direct result of our strong focus on improving our clients' capital efficiency and sustainment of their assets, as well as continuing momentum in the execution of our new Petroleum & Chemicals transformation strategy. In the upstream segment, OPEC's efforts to rebalance excess global supplies continues to weigh on crude oil inventories, while natural gas is gaining share across all energy sectors. However, we're seeing some signs of increasing midstream and upstream opportunities emerging. Shale recovery cost curves are improving, which may increase opportunities for additional pipeline capacity storage, gas processing and related infrastructure projects. And we're actively discussing the next wave of potential midstream gas processing investments with our clients. Associated with these changing dynamics, we're seeing an increase in study requests for LNG bunkering infrastructure projects to support the projected increase in LNG-fueled ships. Given our experience in off-sites, utilities and jetties, we're actively pursuing opportunities associated with planning of these liquefaction projects. In our downstream segment, we continue to operate in a state of overcapacity for refining. However, we are seeing growth from emerging economies as refined product trade flows adjust to population growth and urbanization of non-OECD countries. The U.S. and Middle East are positioning us as net exporters of light products to these regions, while Asia and Latin America are expected to absorb most of the global refined product surpluses to meet domestic demand. We're also working with our clients on solutions to modify refineries to comply with the new MARPOL specifications for low sulfur bunker fuels starting in 2020, and additionally we continue to deliver and pursue smaller U.S. refining opportunities to optimize existing facilities for efficiency in naphtha processing from increasing light oil production. We are assisting our clients to evaluate feedstock conversions to value-added chemicals options, driven by strong petrochemicals demand growth and cheap feedstocks in the U.S. and Middle East. For the quarter, our sales teams were successful in numerous downstream wins to be delivered from our India High Value Design Center. Additionally, we had a number of wins in the Middle East with Aramco and pipeline is increasing in Saudi Arabia. We were also successful on several EPCM long-term alliance renewals with four of our global clients, which positions us for a number of sustaining capital opportunities and new CapEx projects. Our pipeline of sales prospects is also building as global growth continues to be forecast for the petrochemical sector in the next few years. We are also well positioned to win several medium and large size chemical derivatives prospects across the globe. Overall, we're very pleased to see our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog trending up and our global pipeline of prospects strengthening in what has been a challenging environment over the last couple of years. We are moving into the construction execution phase of several EPC projects in the U.S. and remain optimistic of our second quarter half revenue and margin growth, supporting positive momentum into 2018. And now back to Kevin. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. And I'm going to move on to slide 13, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the third quarter. As indicated in our last earnings call, we expected a sequential increase in revenue driven by certain backlog projects moving into the field. And as a consequence, revenues for the quarter improved sequentially to $2.5 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million or 8.5%. GAAP EPS was $0.74 per share, up 30% versus the year-ago period. During the quarter, we incurred certain remaining costs that had been previously identified as part of our 2015 restructuring, primarily in real estate, and they totaled $0.05 per share. When excluding these restructuring costs, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.79, the second straight quarter we have increased sequentially and versus the year-ago period. We are pleased that we're developing some year over year momentum. Our GAAP and adjusted net earnings for the quarter also included $3.5 million, or $0.02 per share, in professional service fees associated with the company's announced acquisition of CH2M. As a result, our underlying operating profit performance was actually stronger at $0.81 per share. Positively, we saw continued strong gross margins during the quarter, which at 18.3% as Steve mentioned, represents a significant 150 basis points improvement year over year. On an adjusted basis, while gross margins were lower than the 19% we achieved last quarter, which as you may recall was due in part to the professional services versus field services mix, professional services gross margin performance continued to improve sequentially. This is evidence that our profitable growth strategy continues to gain traction and that we are driving improvements through improved execution and the targeting of higher value-added services work. As noted also by Steve, our backlog grew to $18.6 billion at quarter end, representing a book to bill of 1 time. Importantly, we will still have over $600 million of A&T protested awards that are not in our backlog and we still remain optimistic that these will ultimately be resolved favorably to Jacobs. Our SG&A costs have also continued to benefit from our reducing restructuring costs and are down $11 million from the year-ago quarter, contributing to an overall year to date decrease of $68 million versus the prior year to date figures. On an adjusted basis, our year to date SG&A is down $24 million versus the year ago period. Lastly, our continued discipline around cash flows resulted in a significant 4.2% decrease in working capital sequentially and a significant 24% decrease versus the year ago quarter. As a consequence, we continued to see strong free cash flow of $152 million, supporting a continued improvement in our net cash position to a total of $476 million, an increase of nearly $140 million versus our second quarter. Moving to slide 14. Our Q3 segment operating profit continued to trend positively for two of the four lines of business on a year to year basis and is up sequentially across three of our four lines of business. Our A&T line of business did see a small decrease in operating profit versus the year-ago quarter as revenue saw some pressure due to our previously announced rebid losses in 2015 and lower level revenues from our AWE joint venture in the UK which is an area we believe has stabilized. As a result, operating profit for A&T decreased by 5.9% versus the year-ago quarter to $50.6 million. However and importantly, A&T's business operating profit margin actually improved nearly 60 basis points to 8.6%. In addition, our pipeline and backlog continued to show growth. As we exit 2017, our comparables from the year-ago periods will ease and when combined with our strong backlog performance, will support our ability to drive incremental year over year growth next year. Our B&I business saw significant 17% increase in revenues year over year, driving a 12% improvement in overall operating profit over the same period. While margins are slightly down versus the year-ago quarter, this was due to strong project performance and high performance fees earned in the year-ago period as well as an increase in field services during the current Q3 period. Positively, margins continued to improve sequentially, reaching a fiscal 2017 high of 8.7% during the current third quarter. For our Industrial business, revenue increased sequentially as expected, as life sciences projects transitioned to the field. This also supported a increase in operating profit for the LOB versus the year-ago quarter by 13.7%. Positively, operating profit margin also rose by over 70 basis points versus the same period to 4.7%. Finally, our P&C line of business also saw sequential margin improvement, helped by strong project performance and continued focus on cost efficiencies. This resulted in an OP margin increase of nearly 100 basis points year over year. Even with the nearly $170 million fall in revenues year over year, P&C's operating profit fell by only $500,000 over that same period. This bodes well for our P&C profit outlook when the industry returns to growth in the future. Please note also that our corporate costs were a bit higher than our normal run rate in this third quarter, driven by our CH2M related acquisition costs and a year to date true-up of corporate cost reductions that were passed back to the lines of business during the quarter. So turning to slide 15. As stated in our Q2 earnings webcast, our 2015 restructuring costs were substantially completed in Q2, with approximately $15 million remaining to be incurred in the second half, costs that were primarily associated with previously identified office consolidation activities. As a result, these activities continued during the quarter, and our net earnings for the third quarter thereby included $0.05 per share charges associated with these activities. Final costs associated with the 2015 restructuring are expected to occur in Q4. Our updated program to date costs are now standing at $437 million with expected annual savings of $285 million. We also continued to make certain strategic investments to support our strategy and profitable growth agenda during the quarter from the $30 million investments we highlighted at the beginning of the year. The EPS impact of these investments in Q3 was $0.05 and we expect to spend the remainder as planned in the fourth quarter of this year. Before turning it back over to Steve for his closing comments, I'd like to give some quick notes regarding our capital allocation on slide 16. As you know, we announced last week that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CH2M and provided financial details on the deal in our associated press announcement and investor deck. I would like you to refer to those presentations for greater detail, but highlight some key aspects here. The transaction value of CH2M equals $2.85 billion in equity paid 60% in cash and 40% in Jacobs equity. We will be using a combination of existing cash and existing revolver capacity, as well as a new committed $1.2 billion three year term loan to fund the cash part of the deal. Post close, we still expect to have liquidity of over $900 million. With regard to our three year share buyback program, we continued to execute against the $500 million authorization in our third quarter. Consequently, we have now spent $250 million of that program to date, purchasing a total of 5.2 million shares. We believe the share buyback program fits within our broader strategy of enhancing shareholder value, and we will continue to have the capacity under our new capital structure to continue to spend against the program. At this time, we expect to continue to execute against the program in an opportunistic manner. During the quarter, we also paid out our second dividend of $0.15 per share and recently declared our third quarterly dividend of another $0.15 per share payable on September 1 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 4. We believe our strong financial position continues to serve us well to invest in our business and drive our profitable growth strategy, while still providing flexibility to support and enhance shareholder value through the aforementioned items. With that, let me hand it back over to Steve. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. And turning to the final slide, we continue to be pleased with our progress over the year and the substantial improvements in operational and financial performance where we're expected to continue to improve through the remainder of fiscal year 2017 and into 2018. While expectations of our underlying operating performance for the upcoming fourth quarter remain generally unchanged, we are forecasting incremental cost associated with the acquisition of CH2M that will impact our fourth quarter earnings per share. As a consequence, we're revising our adjusted EPS guidance to between $3.00 and $3.15 for fiscal 2017, recognizing the incremental cost associated with the transaction of approximately $0.07 per share. Over the last two years, we have made tremendous progress transforming Jacobs to focus on high growth, high margin opportunities. Our third quarter results are yet another sign of our success in our core operations. We are now poised to utilize the combination of CH2M and Jacobs to target additional growth in higher margin, higher growth industries. The acquisition of CH2M represents a significant step on our transformative journey and we remain vigilant and focused on delivering enhanced shareholder value. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator : Yes, thank you. And the first question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning guys. This is Cleve Rueckert on for Steve. Thanks for all the detail on the call, it was appreciated. Steve, just going back to some of your comments on infrastructure, you said infrastructure projects are accelerating in the U.S., but a lot of the wins seem to be international. When do you think the U.S. projects could get awarded to contractors and what do you think still needs to happen to get projects into backlogs? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. I really want my message to be, when I talk about global, it's in U.S. including. We're seeing very positive momentum in the U.S. across both our buildings and infrastructure sector and so the momentum is underway there, and we are booking wins into the backlog and that did contribute to our backlog growth in the third quarter. Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Is there any way you can quantify how much of the 30% growth in the pipeline is coming from the U.S.? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Look, Cleve, this is Kevin. We don't. We're not going to provide that level of detail, but look, we fundamentally believe that the infrastructure play in the U.S. continues to be a robust one regardless of how things play out in Washington. There is an underlying momentum and need for the continued infrastructure spend. And I would say certainly that's the case in the U.S. and to Steve's point during the prepared remarks, also globally, outside of the U.S. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, and just again very specifically, our transportation sector in the U.S. is where \u2013 we've had several wins that we've announced, especially in aviation recently at several major airports, and we're in excellent positions for some additional wins there coming up. But also across the highway sector, the rail sector, the U.S. is clearly a significant contributor to that 30% improvement. Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just turning a little bit more broadly, you mentioned a little bit on optimism in 2018, but I guess keeping it in the context of the targets outlined at the Investor Day, and I think you're doing well on margin improvement. I think 70 basis points year to date is a pretty healthy portion of the 100 to 150 basis points expected by 2019. But how confident are you in the 2% to 4% organic growth by 2019? I mean is there potential to shift some margin improvement more towards organic growth as we move forward into 2018? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, definitely. Again, if you go back to our strategy, it was to initially focus on cleaning up the portfolio, eliminating some of the unprofitable businesses and projects that we've had in the past and we've made great progress there. You can see the effect on margins. But the pivot to growth is underway and clearly we see and are optimistic that we can organically grow. We're doing it in our Buildings & Infrastructure with the nine quarters now in a row of backlog growth. We're now for the most part behind us is some of the lost contract rebid initiatives that occurred back in 2015 and our pipeline in our Aerospace & Technology business, we characterize it as a record high, and we are building backlog there and we're very confident that we're going to see growth in 2018 and beyond. And then we have the timing of some of the more cyclical business, the recoveries that will occur in those industries. And we're seeing signs of life in both our Petroleum & Chemicals as well as our mining sectors that will add further organic growth opportunities as we get into 2018 and 2019. So, yes, we remain very confident in our ability to organically grow at at least the levels that we previously reported in our strategic plan. Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, very much. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, Cleve, just a couple follow-ups on your question on the U.S. infrastructure. We've talked already about the win at the Los Angeles Airport which is an item. We're doing work at LaGuardia as well. There is also recent wins that we announced for the Georgia Department of Transportation, which was a win that we press released. We also did something for PennDOT and we also saw some incremental wins and specifically in Florida's Turnpike Expressway with the Sawgrass Expressway widening. So, a few projects that we press released that are indicative of the continuing building momentum relative to the infrastructure play. Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi folks. Congrats on a good quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Tahira. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Steve and Kevin, if you look at some of the international sort of market you're seeing. And I kind of talked about this when you held your call on the CH2M HILL acquisition. Can you talk a bit more about the water market there and the opportunities you're seeing? I know you have some share here, but there seems to be a lot of opportunity here as well. Would love to get any more color you can provide and how we should be looking at your growth target for infrastructure given this market is also seeing some momentum. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Right. So look, water is one of the most exciting things we're acquiring in the CH2M acquisition. It's a big component of that company. They're clearly an industry leader globally and very much focused on things like state and local municipalities bringing clean water solutions, innovative technology. And what's really exciting now when you put that together, not only with our Jacobs water capability, but our global platform where we bring the capability of bringing that CH2M experience and innovation and technology to our Petroleum & Chemicals and mining footprint across the globe, where our clients are looking for solutions to address regulatory pressures to reduce waste, protect the environment. And so this is in our belief going to create a company that doesn't exist today, the ability to take that across a huge diversified base globally to grow the water sector. So you asked about what's probably the heart of the acquisition when it comes to the acquisition of CH2M's water capability. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it and that's pretty helpful. And, Steve and Kevin, if I look at those growth rates represented for your end market on your Analyst Day, obviously petrochemicals is obviously going through its own cyclical elements, but if I look at the Industrial side, you're fairly off in terms of the top line growth versus that 9% to 10% sort of CAGR that you're hoping for. Are you seeing any signs of life there? What should we look for to expect that type of a revenue growth rate? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, look, a couple of answers to that question, Tahira. The first one, glad you mentioned the Petroleum & Chemicals performance because we're extremely pleased with the results there. If you look at the industry performance, our backlog performance is outperforming. The fact that we're actually growing in a challenging market, I think is a tribute to that line of business' strategy to focus on where the spending is occurring and that's in the downstream sector and even some of the midstream sectors. And so we're extremely pleased there and we do believe at some point we're going to see some positive dynamics on some cyclical recovery. But as it relates to the Industrial business, it really is a timing situation. We're burning off two major life sciences EPCM projects that have for the most part contributed the entire decline in that backlog. We're somewhere close to stabilizing that backlog and we're excited about the opportunities moving into 2018 in the life sciences business. As I mentioned, we are seeing signs of life in the mining sector, albeit it's probably more second half 2018. And so we're in some of the early stages of some major projects in copper and some of the other mining sectors. And at some point, those advanced planning will turn to bigger design and full EPC or EPCM projects. And in our field services business, which is really driven by what goes on in the Petroleum & Chemicals sector as well as some of our other lines of business. We're positive that we're going to see organic growth there as we move into 2018 and 2019. And so putting it all together, we're still confident in our ability to organically grow Industrial and I think we're just in a timing situation where better days are ahead. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it, okay. Thanks a lot, Steve, and congrats again. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yes, Jamie. Good morning. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess two questions. One, Kevin, I was pleasantly surprised with the gross margins in the quarter. It's the second quarter in the row where we're at sort of the 18%-ish range. So sort of just the sustainability of that and is that how margins are trending in backlog? And then also, the Buildings & Infrastructure margins too we're very strong. I don't know if there was any close-outs or anything in that number? And then my last question, I know there is a number of large awards coming within the \u2013 potentially coming I guess \u2013 or within the Aerospace & Technology segment as in the fall or later on this year. So if you can just give us an update on what you think your potential win rate could be. Thanks. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, let me go start with the first part of the question as it relates to the gross margin percentage that we were able to achieve in the quarter. Yeah, it was over 18%, where we were pleased with that, Jamie. You know that the percentage that we have in the second quarter was even higher than that, but that was really driven by the professional service/field services mix dynamic. So, pleased that as we're coming back to a more normalized kind of a mix of the portfolio that we're able to maintain a number that's higher than 18%. I think the most important part of that question really is that we saw continued sequential improvement in the professional service margins in our business. Whether or not we continue to be able to maintain a number of 18% is probably driven by some of the field service mix dynamics. And I don't know that we would necessarily call out a number greater than 18%, but certainly a number approaching that figure is certainly a view that we have and certainly a sustainable kind of figure that we're going to be looking to drive. Certainly it's very much part and parcel to our strategic agenda going forward about going after higher margin opportunities as well executing better to be able to protect and deliver more of the as-sold margin. So we're obviously continuing to make good progress there. As it relates to the second \u2013 the first part of the question. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Let me take that. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So you were talking about our Aerospace & Technology and the momentum moving into 2018 and beyond. As I mentioned, our pipeline is very robust, but if you go back to some of our wins, which are in protest and we're waiting to put them in our backlog. As I mentioned, approximately $600 million of awarded business that's in the protest, half of that is the site tech initiative or the Special Operations Command in Tampa. We won the five year contract. It's $0.75 billion. And based on our backlog rules, that would be somewhere about 50% of that $600 million that we're waiting to put on the backlog. We're still optimistic about converting that from the protest process into the backlog. And then when you take that coupled with the rich pipeline of opportunities, we're excited about what 2018 and beyond brings, Jamie, in that line of business. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. And sorry, was there anything unusual in the Buildings & Infrastructure margin? It was just... Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Good solid performance. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, clean. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. All right. Cool. I'll get back in queue. Thanks. Good quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Good morning gentlemen and welcome aboard, Jon. Jonathan Doros - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: First question, just following on the margin, question maybe for Kevin. You highlighted the unprofitable projects in Jacobs' current backlog going into fiscal year 2017. Obviously, that's been very helpful getting those out of the way. Can you get us an update where we are there and is there exhaustion of that ahead of us as we move and transfer in 2018? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: We believe that we've made, obviously have made good progress and you can see that through the margin profile, Mike, so clearly good steps that have been taken. I don't think we're done yet ultimately, but we've made great progress. We don't have the absolute number as it relates to where we are in that, we called it a $50 million to $100 million opportunity as you may recall, during our Investor Day. But that's the target that we feel great about in terms of the three year plan. We still got some work to do to be able to deliver it. And so, it's not only reorienting around going after the profitable business. It's about continuing to execute better too. So, one of the key parts that we have made really great progress on and is probably coming to the end, is our write-downs as kind of just when we leave as-sold margin on the table. We've reduced those margin write-downs by 50% from 2015 to now. So, we're getting down to a level that we feel as can't be perfect in write-downs, but we feel like we've gotten a big chunk of that, although we'll continue to try and drive that down further. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, let me build on that because I think that's where the CH2M acquisition comes in as well. Both companies have very similar transformation initiatives underway. I would say we're probably got started 12 to 18 months early, but CH2M has a very impressive transformational plan as well, both companies focused on investing in new tools and innovative capabilities. And I would say we're still in the very early stages of that transformation and seeing the benefits because some of the early on major investments have just been launched and so we haven't seen the benefits of those new tools that we've recently rolled out. And there are still more transformational initiatives at both companies are going to now leverage together going forward. So, I think the margin opportunities, especially with the combined CH2M and Jacobs initiative going forward, is still going to be a very significant story in addition to the growth element. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: That's quite encouraging. And my follow-up, Kevin, is you've done a very solid job in working capital reductions. This is evidenced by the cash generation. Obviously, you're going to continue that work in JEC. How do you see that as you look at the CH2 situation, how that can maybe enhance maybe the performance since maybe they were lagging a bit to relative to where you guys were in their transformation on the financial profile side? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah look, I think it's clearly an opportunity. We called it out during the investor presentation on the acquisition working capital being an opportunity. I will tell you, they've done a really nice job in starting that journey. They changed their incentive comp structure this past year to where they're focused on cash flow and clearly that translates into a need to deliver the profit, as well as improve on the working capital side. And they, the team there has already recognized that and started to execute well. Having said that, if we compare and benchmark their numbers versus where we are right now, we think there is continued opportunities. And as I've always said to you and others, improving working capital is, that's pick and shovel work. It's tough work and you got to work at it over time. It is impacted by many people in the organization, sales in terms of the contracts, legal in terms of the contracts, finance teams making sure they're doing a great job in providing accurate invoices and timely invoices to our customers. So it takes a concerted effort across the organization and the good news is CH2M has already started that journey, and we think with the combination that we'll be able to accelerate some progress in that area. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Excellent. Thanks for your thoughts, gentlemen. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning guys and good quarter. I guess I just wanted to follow up on Jamie's question on gross margin. So, I think if I recall from the prepared remarks that your gross margin's up 200 bps year over year in your backlog. So why should I not expect gross margin to be higher in 2018 versus 2017? And I think you commented that 18% is kind of the run rate. Why shouldn't it translate into higher gross margin in 2018? And do you have to give some of that margin back if you want to look to accelerate your backlog relative in the fourth quarter? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Anna. Great question. Look, we're not ruling out improved gross margins. I think there is a lot of factors that go into it. If you look at each of our four lines of businesses, margin improvement opportunities exists. I think what's going to come into play is also potential mix. Now clearly, one of the benefits of the recent margin improvement is not only each line of business, improving their margins, but it's the fact that our Aerospace & Technology and Buildings & Infrastructure, where we enjoy the highest margins, are growing faster right now than our Petroleum & Chemicals and some of our lower margin Industrial sectors. So, our hope is that we are going to see some cyclical recovery in areas like mining and Petroleum & Chemicals, and we do expect to see those organic growth there to be at higher margins that we've seen in the past, but still lower than our current Aerospace & Technology margins for example. So, we have to put all that together, but we want to leave you all with the expectation that we're driving each of the lines of businesses to improve margins across the board. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: And one other thing, Anna, just from my perspective, my commentary was really more short-term oriented as it relates to how we finish the year and enter into 2018. I think longer term, clearly the margin profile we would expect is part of the story as Steve has already outlined. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And any more commentary around SG&A picking up in the third quarter? Because it's been somewhat flat for the past couple of quarters. So do you have to reinvest back into the business and where should it trend into the rest of the year and into 2018? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: A couple things, Anna. The first one is we did have the incremental CH2M related cost. That's part of it. But remember, we had a $10 million benefit in Q2, specifically as associated with our restructuring of the India Welfare Trust plans. And so, you add those up, that takes and explains about 80%, 75% of the total increase quarter over quarter. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then my final question, one of your peers moved to cash EPS after a large acquisition. What are your thoughts on changing the EPS methodology as we prepare for 2018 guidance? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So your question is about whether or not we will talk about cash EPS or? Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Or will you continue reporting on regular adjusted EPS or will you be moving to some sort of cash EPS reporting? Because I think in your accretion analysis, you provided 25% accretion on cash EPS basis. So just trying to figure out whether you'll continue to report as you report now or will you be adjusting for some sort of amortization charge next year? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Okay. I think given the pending and hopeful close of the transaction relative to CH2M, clearly we're going to be providing some insights as it relates to the cash nature of that transaction and I think that will be important for us to target. So, not that we're going eliminate our current reporting expectations on current EPS, but we will be providing insight on the cash side as well. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. It's Alan on for Andy this morning. Kevin, you talked a little bit about how you're thinking about cash flow for at CH2. Maybe you can talk a little about the legacy cash flow. Good working capital improvement this quarter. Where do you think you are in that journey and can you continue to get DSOs down here into 2018? Maybe just talk about that. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Is your question on CH2M or Jacobs? Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Jacobs. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yes, yes look, we're trending pretty nicely as it relates to the incentive targets that we've established for ourselves. We think we're in the neighborhood of being able to deliver against our targets. Teams are doing a really great job on that across the board in all of our businesses and like I communicated earlier, it's tough work. It's pick and shovel work. I'm really proud of the teams doing a great job. That translates into continued improvements, if in fact we continue to drive towards our opportunity. So, yes, we're hoping that that will continue to play out to be able to get us to a place where we're able to give some nice incentive payouts to our teams. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe you can think about how you're thinking or talk about how you're thinking about strategic investments. Do you expect to continue to have some of these strategic investments into 2018 and how are you measuring the returns on the investments that you've made here in 2017? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yes. Remember that we had talked about $30 million or thereabouts of investments for the year, roughly $0.15 per share. We're coming to the end of that. Some of them are one-time; some of them are ongoing. Slightly more than half of it are one-time related. So, ultimately those investments will stop over the course of [2000] here as we end 2017. That does not preclude us from making incremental investments going forward and those continue to be evaluated on an ongoing basis. And we'll provide more insights relative to that for our 2018 views. Having said all of that, it's really about what is the investment, what are the expectations on the return profile, whether it is improving project performance which we're tracking and/or improving potential incremental growth opportunities, which we are also tracking. Those efforts are being monitored and continue to be evaluated on an ongoing basis, and ultimately we determine what the return profile looks like. And sometimes, if in fact things are going well, we might double down on the investment. In other cases, if we don't see things working, we want to understand why and we may adjust and do something differently. But we're monitoring and tracking the capabilities that are being generated and what the return profile is to determine whether or not the investments made sense. Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning there. Great quarter. Clearly starting to build, continue to build some P&C backlog. Was curious if the outlook anticipates any kind of return to growth in 4Q for that business, or are you thinking more about 2018? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I think we're optimistic in several prospects and really it comes down to the timing of those crossing the finish line. There is a scenario that we're going to continue to see modest improvement in the rest of this year. And, but clearly into 2018, we're expecting to see year over year profit growth. And some of that will be driven by organic improvement, organic growth improvement and other parts of it will be driven by the continuation of the transformation process that's yielding higher margins and improved cost structure, et cetera. So all in all, we continue to see the prospects of steady improvement in our Petroleum & Chemicals, irregardless of market conditions. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay and, Steve, the work that you're picking up there, is it in traditionally more profitable areas of the market for Jacobs within that segment? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, yeah, it's traditionally where we're more capable and we see positive dynamics in the market. And specifically that's the petrochemical sector, but also some of the midstream opportunities that we talked about with some of the piping and associated infrastructure for a lot of the Petroleum & Chemicals growth opportunities across the globe. So it's in areas where we believe we're going to be able to demonstrate gross margin and operating profit margin improvement into 2018 and 2019 versus historical performance. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And then, might be a better way to ask this question, but I'll try anyway with, you said with CH there isn't a lot of overlap with Jacobs. But I'm more curious as you think about managing the combined organization, does that change any of the pursuits or pipelines for the core Jacobs business today as you think about kind of reallocating certain resources to areas CH does really well? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: It's hard to answer that specifically because we now bring together two large opportunities, very diversified as you said, very complementary. Yeah, there is some minimal overlap, so if we'd looked at that minimal overlap, those may be areas where we'll have now the positive opportunity to select the highest margin opportunities. But the majority of the story, whether it's the water example I gave earlier or it's our ability to combine these two companies and solve problems that in areas and opportunities in areas today like smart infrastructure, whether it's smart cities, buildings, highways and putting our diversified, complementary diversified capabilities on some very large scale global programs around smart infrastructure. And even nuclear and environmental where we're going to take our capability to work in very high hazard, high consequence asset management programs for Department of Defense and NASA and other examples and merge that with their Tier 1 nuclear and environmental capabilities to really create solutions in these complex high-contaminated nuclear sites at an accelerated and lower cost than previous experiences. So, the majority of what we get excited about is truly complementary, and therefore unlike a lot of previous acquisitions in our industry where there was a lot of overlap and primarily cost focus. Yes, we're going to get cost synergies , but the real story here is the growth opportunity of leveraging that complementary skills and capabilities. Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Justin Ward with Wells Fargo. Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Good morning, Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Good morning, Justin. Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just kind of building off actually some of that most recent commentary, I was wondering if you could expand a bit more on the revenue synergies of the business. Jacobs, very diversified in its service capabilities and end markets and obviously the CH2M is going to expand that. Can you just kind of rehash the initiatives you guys have implemented to make revenue synergies more systematic across the business? And then what inning are you in there? And then talk about how the CH2M will integrate into that systematic process. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah look, I think that we got to go back to what we talked about the strategy of, it's not only the fact that we developed a strategy and took a step back and identified where we see where capital is going to be spent globally and where we bring the capabilities to match up on that global capital spend. But we match that up with a separate process to really understand where we're making money, where we're not, by customer, by geography, by office. And therefore we do believe we now have a much more systematic system that starts with the pursuit process and going after business that is going to deliver our stated goals of margin improvement, organic growth and create shareholder value. As we now put that together with CH2M's system, which again we're very excited about the fact that our due diligence revealed that they have a very similar culture and initiatives underway of eliminating unprofitable business, really reducing the number of clients and that they go after to core clients that have demonstrated capabilities and margin improvement, and also investing to advance what is already a company that has cutting edge technology and innovation and putting that together. And just feel like I'm repeating myself here, but the complementary nature of those capabilities in sectors like water and Tier 1 nuclear, environmental management, and combine that with our global platform in a history and a proven experience of high quality project delivery excellence and our client culture, core client cultures, we just think the revenue synergies are real and will be the real story here of this combination over the next several years. Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, but so it sounds like the process is internally at legacy Jacobs for when you're going out to bid these projects, making sure you're capturing all of the project that Jacobs is capable of doing. It sounds like those processes are now fully in place and really it's a matter of just going forward, we should start to see an acceleration of the revenue synergies. Is that a good way to think about it? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, I believe the rigor and process is in place. What's still unfolding is the rollout of our strategic investments which will accelerate those, make us even more capable, whether it's project tools and other systems in our commercial processes, all the way through our project delivery initiatives. And so, I don't want to come across here is that, we have all that now set up and it's all about winning business with this new process. I think our process improvement is unfolding, but the fundamentals of what I just talked about is in place of really making sure that systematically, the business that we win will now get converted at a much better rate from what margin we believed was there at the time we sold it to the time we conclude that program and project a couple of years later. And I would say, we're at a much better point today than our company was a couple of years ago. But we're only going to get even stronger on that as we go forward. Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning guys. So you mentioned that $600 million in projects were under protest in A&T. What's been the success rate here in converting that into bookings and how should we think about the potential timing? And then also, how much line of sight do you have in getting your quarterly revenue run rate in this business back towards the mid $600 millions into the next year? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, on the first question, the success rate is very high and converting these protests into final wins and getting them on our backlog. I will say that $600 million is just indicative of what's unfortunate, is a more prolonged protest inefficiency that in our government processes here, but that's an industry-wide situation. That's nothing unique to Jacobs. But we feel highly confident based on the historical performance, as you asked, of converting that $600 million into our backlog. As it relates to timing, that's the big uncertainty. We're conservatively factoring that into our forecast that that's probably most of it in 2018. As I mentioned, we did have the Nevada National Security Site, which was a small component of that $600 million that we just recently won in now the fourth quarter. And so that will convert in the fourth quarter to our backlog, but the majority of that $600 million we would say hopefully will be in the first half of 2018 or sometime soon after that. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then just moving over into margins and sticking with A&T, just for this past quarter, I just wanted to make sure, were there any one-time items or closeouts that benefits that, drove the mid to upper 8% range? And then also in P&C, can you just provide more color? You mentioned in your prepared comments that you're starting to see a next wave of gas processing opportunities. Just trying to understand the timing for this and what sort of market opportunity this represents for Jacobs. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I think what I'm pleased is we've been very consistent on the story around Aerospace & Technology, that it was unfortunate that we had some rebid losses back in 2015, but those losses were lower margin compared to the wins that Aerospace & Technology has achieved over the last six to 12 months. And so a good part of the margin improvement in Aerospace & Technology is a result of that whole strategy of winning higher value business. And beyond that, there is no one-time issue that is contributing that we know of. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So one other just additional comment as it relates to A&T. What's interesting and really pleasing to see is the team has done a really great job. While we talked about some of these rebids that occurred where we weren't as successful as we wanted, most all of the rebids have been done, have been executed successfully, where we came out of a very big lumpiness of over the last two years of about a big percentage of our business coming up for rebid. And other than these items that we've talked about, which have a fairly small timetable associated with kind of running through and the comparables start to get easy pretty soon. The interesting part is all of the other rebids, at least a vast majority of them, we've won them at higher margins. So the rebids have, because of the strong performance of the A&T group and focused on doing the business well and better and more profitably, many of the rebids of the portfolio that we won are now at higher margins. So Steve talked about new business that is higher margin. Not only that, but the rebids are ultimately coming through now with higher margins as well. So we're very pleased with the teams' ability to have driven that as well. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's all for me. Thank you. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. So I now would like to turn the call back over to Steve Demetriou, Jacobs Chairman and CEO for any closing comments. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, thank you again to the investment community for listening to today's quarterly call. Hopefully you get a sense that our actions we're undertaking are continuing to increase shareholder value and we're driving a stronger and healthier Jacobs. So, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to our fiscal year 2017 fourth quarter earnings call. Before discussing our financial results for the quarter, I will begin with a review of the significant strides we have made against the strategic objectives we presented at our Investor Day last December. In fiscal 2017, we saw strong results in our Aerospace & Technology and Building & Infrastructure lines of business, which are benefiting from positive government and infrastructure dynamics, while delivering solid stable results in our Petroleum & Chemicals and Industrial businesses where we continued to face headwinds in certain of our end markets particularly those more exposed to commodities. Over the course of the year, we made important improvements to our company, including several strategic investments and acquisitions to support our profitable growth agenda. Let me now recap our strategic imperatives and the progress we're making. So first, building a high-performance culture, the chains to the line of business structure is clearly improving accountability, transparency and discipline across all of Jacobs. We have a line management incentive metrics that focus on increasing profitability, driving growth, unleashing cash flow and generating higher return on capital employed. We believe the combination of ownership and accountability at the lines of business, coupled with the right corporate level incentives, is instrumental to driving long-term shareholder value. Second, transforming the core. Our focus on operational efficiency, project delivery and sales effectiveness is clearly resonating in our results. For example, project delivery has improved with net fiscal year 2017 write-downs reduced by more than 50% year-over-year and a measurable increase in our as-sold margin conversion. We have successfully completed the 2015 restructuring program, which unlocked our ability for Jacobs to enter the next phase of our profitable growth strategy. Third, profitable growth. In fiscal 2017, we made great progress in executing a balanced strategy to focus on the most attractive end markets with an optimized cost structure that will position us for long-term profitable growth. Revenue grew year-over-year in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of organic improvement and some benefit from recent acquisitions and currency. From a profitability standpoint, both our fiscal year 2017 gross margins and adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly, which after one-year is reaching levels that position us to achieve our three-year strategic target range. And after our August announcement of the CH2M acquisition, we immediately began implementing IMO, Integration Management Office investments and cost synergy actions during the fourth quarter in preparation for the expected closing of the acquisition. This gives us a running start as we approach the closing of this transformative and value-creating acquisition. So now turning to Slide 6, an update on the CH2M acquisition. With the pending merger of Jacobs and CH2M, we're combining two world-class organizations to create a global professional services leader that will deliver highly differentiated solutions for a more connected sustainable world. Since the announcement, our joint Integration Management Office has made great progress during the planning stage and is preparing Jacobs to deliver against strategic plan commitments as well as the cost and revenue synergy initiatives that we will execute following the close. The CH2M team delivered strong calendar third quarter results that were in line with our expectations. EBITDA for CH2M's third quarter was $99 million, including the favorable settlement with the Texas Department of Transportation for the MOPAC project, and the results also reflected costs associated with our pending acquisition. Kevin will provide more detail on the recently reported CH2M results. We remain confident in our outlook for the CH2M acquisition, including our expectation for 15% first 12-month adjusted EPS accretion and to reach a net $150 million annual run rate cost synergies at completion of integration. Underpinning this confidence is a detailed plan driven by a combined Jacobs-CH2M Integration Management Office. As previously stated, the major areas for cost synergies are in corporate and business unit overhead, real estate, procurement and IT. In addition, we are focused on capturing revenue synergies from expanded offerings which are not included in our accretion assumption. More importantly, as part of the integration planning process, I, together with a few of our business leaders, have been to dozens of CH2M and Jacobs offices and have met with selective clients to demonstrate our priority for talent retention in our commitment to combine the best of both companies. The feedback has been extremely positive and, in my belief, an initial step of winning the hearts and minds of the combined employee base. Regulatories have been obtained and the CH2M shareholder meeting to vote on the transaction is scheduled for December 13. Assuming shareholders approve the deal, we expect to close around mid-December. Turning to Slide 7. Our Jacobs fourth quarter results were yet another signpost of our continued strong execution against our three-year strategic plan. Backlog growth was strong, up $1.2 billion from the third quarter and significantly up year-over-year, which still excludes the impact from approximately $850 million of previous awards under protest. We remain confident that most, if not all, of these protested awards will eventually be converted to our backlog. Total Jacobs revenue grew 6% sequentially and was up modestly year-over-year, driven by strong growth in professional services. Gross margins remained strong at 17.9%, up significantly year-over-year as we continue to focus on our strategy toward higher-value projects and driving operational excellence to maintain margin through delivery. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, was at the higher end of our expectations. And Kevin will cover the components of EPS, including a bridge to GAAP EPS in his remarks. And finally, full year free cash flow was solid, driven by continued improvement in our operational working capital. Turning to Slide 8, I'll now discuss our backlog performance in further detail. As I've previously stated, backlog growth was strong and increased 6.4% sequentially and by 5.5% year-over-year despite the over $850 million in Aerospace & Technology awards still under protest and not included in these figures. It is also important to note that backlog generally includes only the initial years of large multi-year awards. For example, we have only booked $415 million in our backlog for the recent $4.6 billion award with the Missile Defense Agency. Furthermore, the year-over-year growth in backlog was driven by higher-value professional services, which grew 10.8% year-over-year, indicating a strong pipeline for future revenue growth. This more than offset a modest year-over-year decline in field services backlog. From a line of business perspective, our higher-growth, higher-margin focus businesses are leading the way in driving profitable growth. Our Aerospace & Technology and Buildings & Infrastructure segments both posted strong growth and backlog. Aerospace & Technology was up 22% year-over-year, and for the eighth quarter in a row, Building & Infrastructure backlog grew sequentially. This strength was partially offset by Petroleum & Chemicals, which was down 3.7% year-over-year given the continued challenged oil and gas environment and industrial line of business, which ended the fiscal year down 8.7%, driven by a strong revenue burn and executing two large life sciences projects. As I mentioned earlier, we are winning higher-value business while improving project execution. As a result, gross margin and backlog was up modestly both sequentially and year-over-year. Our Aerospace & Technology, Building & Infrastructure and Petroleum & Chemicals businesses all saw sequential improvement in gross margin and backlog with Industrial down modestly. I'll now discuss each line of business in more detail, beginning with Aerospace & Technology on Slide 9. Our Aerospace & Technology business is executing well against this strategy : to expand into weapon systems sustainment, become a Tier 1 nuclear provider and drive further into disruptive areas of technology. During the quarter, we progressed our strategy with a marquee $4.6 billion win with the Missile Defense Agency. This is a major milestone for Jacobs and specifically our Aerospace & Technology business and strengthens our position as a leading defense contractor and opens the door for expanded opportunities. In addition, we further solidified our presence in the federal civilian IT services space with our acquisition of Blue Canopy, a leader in cybersecurity and data analytics. The team at Blue Canopy has an impressive resume of clients, including the United States intelligence community. With this acquisition, we expect to further capture adjacent opportunities and leverage the domain knowledge into our broader Jacobs Connected Enterprise initiative. And of course, the CH2M acquisition will add further significant strategic capabilities and growth to our A&T business, including establishing the combined company as a Tier 1 nuclear and environmental leader. Momentum in Aerospace & Technology continues to build with our backlog increasing by over $600 million to $6.2 billion. This represents 22% year-over-year and 12% sequential growth. In addition to a few of key wins that I previously mentioned, other major awards are long-term contracts supporting national priority programs of the U.S. government. For example, the NNSA M&O win has the potential to be a 10-year contract if all options are exercised, and the $1.2 billion rebid win with NASA is an eight-year contract. Looking forward, our Aerospace & Technology end markets remain healthy, and we have differentiated ourselves by providing unique solutions, with a delivery and cost model that positions us for continued profitable growth. Now on to Slide 10 to discuss our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business. Our B&I line of business ended the year with another sequential quarter increase, and overall backlog grew 7.5% year-over-year. We are on track with our strategic plan to grow profitably by investing in targeted sectors such as transportation, social infrastructure and water, with leverage from our transformed Global Integrated Delivery model. Our end markets are robust as we see a decade of opportunities in the pipeline across all of our major focus areas, driven by factors such as urbanization, an upcoming refresh of aging infrastructure and the infusion of artificial intelligence and connectivity into infrastructure assets. Flipping the lens on our business to a macro perspective, our key geographies of Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific continue to show strength despite political noise in the news. Let me provide more detail by our major focus areas. In transportation, our traditional highway business remains strong globally, and we're seeing an exciting increase in rail and aviation projects across the globe. For example, in the UK, Network Rail's next five-year investment in railway infrastructure is due to begin in 2019. In Australia, we're seeing a major program developing that expands the reach of the local passenger rail system. In New Zealand, government is advancing the development of their light rail system to address upcoming demands associated with the America's Cup and the APEC summit in 2021. In the U.S., we continue to see opportunities emerge across the country, both in high speed and light rail. And CH2M will further strengthen our global expertise in rail as they are the technical adviser for one of the largest and most technologically advanced high-speed rail projects in all of Asia. Turning to aviation. This market is robust due to continued passenger growth, especially in emerging economies, aging terminals in some geographies and improved profitability among major airlines. We have demonstrated our ability to win and execute major global projects with strong sales in fiscal year 2017. This includes a major win in the fourth quarter for program management at one of the largest U.S. international airports, and we are pursuing a major opportunity for an airport expansion in Asia Pacific. Moving to the opportunity in water. We continue to see strong demand for water services, and with our pending combination with CH2M's industry-leading water brand and capabilities and Jacobs' global operating platform, we emerged as one of the most comprehensive providers in the high-growth water sector. As identified in our strategy last year, the water market has a need for a service partner that can seamlessly and efficiently deliver water expertise globally, and we look forward to executing against that opportunity post close. Data analytics and artificial intelligence is driving improved decision-making and increased demand across all facets of our Building & Infrastructure business. For example, in collaboration with key third-party partners, we are using anonymized cell phone data to conduct the analytics to help one of the UK's largest cities make intelligent, data-driven investment decisions that will help shape their transport solutions into the future. And another example of how we're implementing Jacobs Connected Enterprise is in Wales, where we leverage real-time 4D virtual reality to support the upgrade program for two sections of a major highway. Our scale provides us the ability to invest in leading-edge technology that is globally transferable. As such, we are drastically improving our differentiation versus competitors that are still operating in legacy 3D environments. In summary, our Buildings & Infrastructure business had a strong year and are well positioned for fiscal year 2018 as the planned combination of Jacobs and CH2M will result in market-leading solutions across buildings, water and transportation. Moving to Slide 11. Our Industrial line of business achieved sequential backlog growth driven by life sciences wins in Ireland and in field services with improving U.S. construction. Backlog was at $2.8 billion, up $600 million from the prior quarter but still down year-over-year due to the continued work-off from the two sizable life sciences projects in the year-ago backlog. However, gross margin in our Industrial backlog is up year-over-year, driven in part by improvements in the mining and specialty chemicals business. Our life sciences business remains healthy. Diversification of our project portfolio from large CapEx to small/mid-CapEx projects has been particularly successful and is driving a strong baseload revenue stream. Increased investment in gene/cell therapy will be a market driver over the near term. We are well positioned to capture work and have seen an uptick in life sciences projects and prospects this quarter as we focus on the U.S. West Coast, mainland Europe and in China. Our Mining & Minerals market continues to recover as we see improving conditions globally. Strength in copper has led to project restarts in the study phase, where we have captured work. We are optimistic many of these studies will convert to full execution, with revenue gaining momentum beginning late next calendar year to position our mining business for growth in our fiscal year 2019. During the quarter, we saw minimal impact to our field services business in the Gulf Coast from hurricane-related delays. We were fully ramped up, backup within a few weeks, and so we do not expect to see material CapEx spend from hurricane-related damages impacting Jacobs. A strong sales quarter for global field services came predominantly from placement of multiple long-term sustaining services contracts. The fourth quarter saw a high level of proposal activity, driven by maintenance demand and new client engagement, resulting in a 27% increase in backlog quarter-over-quarter. Finally, our Petroleum & Chemicals business on Slide 12. In line with our strategy, we continue to focus on downstream opportunities along with the delivery of maintenance, turnaround and sustaining capital services. Although we closed fiscal year 2017 with revenue and backlog down $200 million year-over-year due to continued challenging industry conditions. I'm very pleased with the way our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog held up as compared to our oil and gas industry peers who experienced significant reductions in this sector. Also positively, our Petroleum & Chemicals gross profit in backlog increased year-over-year. Higher margins in backlog are a direct result of our continuing momentum in targeting more profitable opportunities and focusing on project delivery excellence. Looking at the demand across our end markets. The upstream oil market rebalance efforts are showing progress, as reflected in recent strengthening of crude oil prices. The chemicals market remains robust on the heels of low natural gas prices as chief feedstocks, primarily ethane, continues to propel investments in North America and the Middle East. Globally, the focus is largely on derivative petrochemicals. Within refining, product exports are expected to continue from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Latin America. MARPOL regulations in 2020 are a possible windfall for heavy crude refiners. Continued CapEx for refining capacity in the Middle East and Asia is expected to continue, driven by near-term economics. Our near-term plans are to remain focused on downstream opportunities and to maintain strong project discipline to improve operating income margins. To further drive top line growth, we have made key hires to aid in our top pursuits and accelerate strategic investments in areas such as Jacobs Connected Enterprise. We have multiple projects underway to deploy solutions that collect and analyze the data from our clients' critical infrastructure in order to improve their safety and efficiency. We believe that our solution offerings can drive double-digit returns on investment for our customers. We are also hearing positive early feedback from our clients on the opportunities to leverage CH2M's strong water services as part of a combined offering post the close of the transaction. While we feel that we are coming out of the trough in energy markets, until we see several quarters of sustained improvement in pricing, we remain cautious on growth projects \u2013 prospects for fiscal year 2018. However, we feel confident in our ability to continue to stabilize backlog and to drive operating margin improvement. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Steve. And moving to Slide 13, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the quarter sequentially across both professional and field services grew, resulting in a combined increase of 5.5% from Q3. This marks the second quarter of sequential revenue growth, and on a year-over-year basis, overall revenue was up modestly for the first time in 11 quarters. Looking into fiscal 2018, we expect revenue, excluding any impact from CH2M, to be slightly down sequentially as Q1 represents our normal softest quarter and actually may be down year-over-year, excluding CH2M. However, we expect revenue to increase both sequentially and year-over-year as we progress from Q1 through the balance of our fiscal 2018. Gross margins continued to be strong at 17.9%, up 150 basis points year-over-year. And GAAP operating profit margin was 4%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted operating profit margins were 5.4%, around flat sequentially but up 30 basis points year-over-year. While SG&A was up slightly in Q4, this was driven by business development costs, technology and strategic investments and some additional legal settlement costs. GAAP EPS was $0.78, a significant increase from $0.24 in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by the closing of our successful 2015 restructuring initiative. During the quarter, we also incurred $0.09 in CH2M acquisition professional fees, integration and related costs as well as $0.11 of costs associated with CH2M and 2015 restructuring-related activity. When excluding these costs, our adjusted EPS was $0.98 on 120.1 million shares. Both GAAP and adjusted EPS included about $0.07 from a discrete tax benefit. For modeling purposes, I thought I'd spend a little bit of time and talk a little bit about bridging our adjusted EPS results of $0.98 to compare, on a like-for-like basis, with what I believe is the current consensus estimate of $0.82. So when you start with $0.98, one should subtract $0.07 for the discrete tax benefit, part of which is reflected within our interest expense line. One should also subtract $0.05 for the portion of CH2M costs that we guided to last quarter, which we believe is being incorporated into the current consensus estimate. And of note, our net after-tax gain on the sale of Neste Jacobs was not significant at $0.02 to $0.03 for the quarter. This was effectively offset by certain legal settlement costs that we incurred during the quarter. Accounting for these items, our underlying results, consistent with the $0.82, effectively exceeded by about $0.03 to $0.04. We do recognize that the current $0.09 of CH2M acquisition and integration cost is higher than the $0.05 that we originally guided to last quarter and that we now excluded the cost for purposes of our presentation given the discrete nature of this cost. During the quarter, we proactively determined that it was appropriate to accelerate our efforts in this regard, and as a result, more costs were recognized during the fourth quarter than we originally planned. These Q4 costs specifically relate to IMO activities, our Integration Management Office, and other costs such as legal and other advisory fees. The additional $0.04 of costs in the quarter do not represent an additional amount of overall costs expected with these efforts but only an acceleration of them. In the quarter and going forward, as is customary, we will exclude these costs as well as other onetime transaction costs such as investment banking fees, change in control costs and other advisory fees as an adjustment to our EPS to better identify our underlying sustainable earnings given that these normal one-time acquisition-related costs will not continue beyond our integration efforts. In order to provide transparency, we will separately call out these costs from the $225 million in one-time costs that we have already called out and which are necessary to achieve our synergy expectations. We will provide, obviously, more detail on these costs post close. So now turning to a review of our fiscal full year 2017 results on Slide 14. While full fiscal year revenue declined by 8% versus the 2016 figure, our purposeful transition to higher-growth, higher-margin opportunities and improved execution delivered an increase in gross margin dollars, resulting in our gross margin percentage up over 150 basis points year-over-year, indicative of our strong execution against our strategic plan. Our increased fiscal discipline and execution led to our adjusted operating profit increasing by approximately 3% year-over-year, resulting in our adjusted EPS growing in 2017 to $3.24, an increase of approximately 5% year-over-year. Free cash also continued to be strong, with operating working capital down approximately 30% year-over-year. This resulted in our net cash position doubling to $536 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Finally, our book-to-bill trailing \u2013 for the trailing 12 months continued to improve, climbing to 1.1 times. Looking at Slide 15. Let's look at the sequential trends in revenue and gross margin in more detail. As highlighted at our 2016 Investor Day, our strategic objectives included a renewed focus on improving project execution, reducing write-downs and targeting higher-margin opportunities. This has resulted in a fundamental improvement to our business, as shown by the step change in gross margin percentages post Q1 fiscal 2017, and this is particularly impressive given the continued challenging conditions in commodity and energy markets. In line with our strategic focus for profitable growth, we have now seen two consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth in three of our four lines of business. Moving to Slide 17. Operating profits for fiscal year 2017 for two of our lines of businesses were up in fiscal 2017 versus last year, and a third was near flat. Operating profit margins were up significantly for all lines of business, continuing the positive trend we saw in fiscal year 2016 across several of our businesses. Operating profit for our A&T business was relatively flat at $203 million versus fiscal year 2016 as we continued to be impacted by loss from lower-margin contracts in late 2016. However, and importantly, operating profit margins continued to trend higher, finishing up 90 basis points at 8.6%. If you recall, margins were up 70 basis points in fiscal year 2016 versus 2015, so we have now been able to deliver 150 basis point improvement over the last two years. And with the recent strong backlog performance, we are now poised for revenue growth in our A&T business in 2018. Operating profit for our B&I business reached almost 11% to $193 million versus our fiscal year 2016, a 14 basis point improvement margin to 7.9%. For comparison, we saw 190 basis point improvement in fiscal 2016 versus 2015, or approximately 200 basis points improvement over the past two years. Meanwhile, our Industrial line of business operating profit increased nearly 42% to $115 million, representing a significant increase of 130 basis points to 4.2%. A material part of this improvement was from the elimination of costs related to litigation settlement and customer bankruptcy costs that did not repeat in fiscal 2017 versus the 2016 figures. Lastly, our P&C business, Petroleum & Chemicals, saw a 10% increase in operating profit in fiscal 2017 to $114 million as challenged energy markets continued to weigh on this line of business. Margins, however, continued to improve and were up nearly 80 basis points to 4.6% in fiscal year 2017 versus the prior year. This is a continuation of the 60 basis point improvement we saw last year. Lastly, our non-allocated corporate overhead increased $21 million year-over-year due to strategic investments in IT systems and incentive compensation. Now let me turn to Slide 17 to briefly discuss CH2M's third quarter results. So of course, we look forward to providing more detail on CH2M post closing. CH2M revenue of $1.2 billion includes a negative impact from the deconsolidation of the [Audio Dip] JV and the positive impact from a MOPAC settlement. Excluding both, revenue would have increased 3% year-over-year. From a profitability standpoint, both items were included in the GAAP operating margins of 6.7% that were reported by CH2M. These two items positively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points. And let me provide a bit more detail on the MOPAC settlement and its impact on CH2M's third quarter results. During the quarter, the company recognized $32 million of incremental revenue from an agreed-upon settlement with the Texas Department of Transportation, which was partially offset by $21 million of additional cost. As a consequence, on a net basis, there was an $11 million benefit to operating income in the quarter related to MOPAC. All in all, the performance in the quarter certainly underscores our continued confidence in the solid outlook for the CH2M portfolio of business. As a result, we continue to be confident in our previously announced accretion expectations for the first 12 months post close. Because our fiscal 2018 results, however, will now only include nine months of CH2M results, we estimate that approximately two-thirds of that accretion benefit will be seen in the first nine months or approximately $0.30 to $0.35 versus our guidance for Jacobs as a stand-alone entity. Of course, we will provide additional insight post close and during our fiscal Q2 earnings call. So let me comment on Slide 18 on the first \u2013 final quarter of our successful 2015 restructuring program. Our final recurring annual savings are $289 million, and the cost to achieve these savings was $444 million. Importantly, our cash restructuring costs that were included in our cost to achieve those benefits resulted in a cash payback of roughly one-year versus the cash expenses. Moving to CH2M-related and expected synergies. We continue to estimate that $150 million of net synergies will be realized after completion of our integration efforts, with a cost to achieve these synergies of $225 million. You'll also note that consistent with our acceleration of activities in our Integration Management Office efforts, Jacobs also proactively took actions in anticipation of a successful completion of the CH2M closing. As a result, there were $13.5 million in fourth quarter restructuring costs to begin to drive synergies in our fiscal year 2018. Before turning the call back to Steve to discuss our outlook, I would like to provide a framework as to how to think about post-CH2M balance sheet and capital allocation strategy for the company. Again, we anticipate a net debt position of approximately $1.9 billion immediately following the close, including a new $1.5 billion three-year term loan. Additionally, we'll have $900 million of liquidity capacity existing on our revolving credit facility. And moving to capital allocation going forward, our short-term cash deployment will continue to be focused on paying down our planned larger debt position. However, we continue to have buyback authorization available as a capital return tool, and $252 million remains on that outstanding authorization. We will plan to execute against repurchases in an opportunistic manner and are prepared to support our share price should there be any dislocation due to post-CH2M close market dynamics. And as of this point in time, there is no change to our current dividend program. Finally, while we continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and divestitures, our continued and primary focus will be to reduce debt in the short term. So now let me turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts. Steve Demetriou : All right. Thank you, Kevin. In summary, we're delivering against our three-year strategy to transform Jacobs. I'm excited to see that accountability and operational discipline has become ingrained in our culture. This has resulted in stronger commercial and project execution with record backlog and profitability. We're tracking well for a successful integration with CH2M that we will believe \u2013 that we believe will drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder value. Our stand-alone Jacobs outlook is for adjusted earnings per share guidance in a range of $3.25 to $3.60. Assuming a mid-December close, we estimate approximately an additional $0.30 to $0.35 of adjusted EPS for fiscal year 2018 from the CH2M acquisition. And we are reiterating our CH2M expectations for 15% adjusted EPS accretion in the first 12 months following the close. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Historically, it made sense to look at Jacobs' operating margins rather than the gross margins because there are often changes in the professional services mix versus field services, which you guys are experiencing now, obviously. So I mean, do you agree with that perspective on how to look at it? And what's the expectation embedded in guidance for operating margins for 2018? It sounded like maybe from your comments that some of the margin growth, at least at the gross margin level, is moderating. I'm not sure if that would be the case at the operating margin level as well. Kevin Berryman : So Steve, thanks for the question. A couple of comments. Look, I do believe we're focused on driving the, let's call it, the gross profit level of the company, which is translating into improved margins. And we think that, that will continue to happen regardless of the mix of professional services versus field services. As you know, field services is a lower-margin business. And consequently, that, to the extent that we do see that growing as a percent, which could happen given the mix that we have right now in backlog, is largely professional services. And that is an opportunity for us to start to accelerate growth longer term in field services because we have the opportunity to execute some of that professional services and transform it into field services business longer term. But we really are focused on the return elements associated with it, and gross profit dollars and gross margin dollars, we expect, will continue to improve, not at the rate that we saw in 2017. We obviously ramped up significantly in the year, and so I would say there's a moderating impact in 2018 versus some of the improvement we saw in 2017. And I think that, that's just a prudent perspective to take at this particular point in time. We still are very excited about the margin profile, and I think that, that looks good for the future of the company. Steven Fisher : Okay. So just to be clear, the 5.4% adjusted operating margin, it sounds like you expect some modest improvement in that in 2018. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Steven Fisher : Okay. Steve Demetriou : Go ahead. Steve, I was just going to add to Kevin's comment that I think we got to look at both equally. The gross margin, especially by line of business, really gives us a good indication of our commercial strategies, our focus on higher-value business. But at the end of the day, operating profit margin, EBITDA margin are equally \u2013 we're intensely focused on. And we clearly believe that there's opportunity to further strengthen operating profit margin as part of what we laid out in our three-year strategy. And so we're going to continue to develop strategies and plans that seek to drive increases in operating profit margin. Steven Fisher : Okay, that's helpful. And Kevin, thanks for the bridge there on the quarter. Maybe if you can just give us a sense for the framework around what things you're going to be including and excluding from earnings, adjusted earnings as we close CH2M. Just kind of wondering how wide the gap is going to be between GAAP earnings and adjusted to make sure we're kind of consistently including and excluding things. And along those lines, what's in the $0.30 to $0.35 that you have assumed already for fiscal 2018? Kevin Berryman : $0.30 to $0.35 accretion? We have not included onetime costs associated with the transaction. So what we're separating is, let's call it, the discrete. We will separate and call out the discrete costs, whether they're investment banking fees, change in control costs, other advisory fees, IMO-related activities, which will continue, for the time being, into the balance of not necessarily the full year of 2018 but certainly a big chunk of it as they are driving the integration efforts. So it's really, we're separating the discrete costs versus what we consider to be the sustainable kind of margin profile that the business will be able to deliver once we're complete with the acquisition. The numbers, especially when you include the onetime change in control costs, are pretty significant. Those numbers are kind of adjusting, as we speak, so I don't really want to quote a number yet because I'll probably be wrong as we're working through the integration. But at the end of the day, they're somewhat sizable and will be another chunk on top of the $225 million. I will tell you, though, that those numbers were always embedded into our valuation. There's no change versus what our original expectations were. So they are kind of \u2013 probably, the biggest piece will come in our Q2 probably or Q1, late Q1. It depends on ultimately what the timing and how that works. But I think that ultimately, it's going to be \u2013 the biggest chunk of change will be coming in Q1, Q2, and then it will ramp down to a \u2013 slide down to a normal kind of IMO-related activity-related costs. So big numbers in Q1 and Q2. Steven Fisher : And that excludes amortization, the $0.30 to $0.35? Kevin Berryman : Yes, yes. Steven Fisher : Okay. All right, I will turn it over. Thanks. Kevin Berryman : Yes, yes. No, I'm sorry. It includes the incremental amortization, I'm sorry. So that's a reported EPS accretion number, adjusted reported EPS number. Steven Fisher : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you can talk about a little bit more what you're seeing in mining, in terms of the types of commodities and whether it's expansion versus greenfields where you're seeing a pickup in bidding activity. And if you could, Steve, just rank for us where the business is in the cycle since the major acquisition, just a pro forma, because it's my understanding that backlog is still near historical lows. Hopefully, you folks have a good runway in front of you as we think about what this business looked like in the last cycle. Steve Demetriou : Yes. So we're in the early \u2013 very early phases of what we would call a modest uptick. So we \u2013 as I mentioned, we're now seeing studies come back up. So as projects from the past got shut down because of what was going on with commodity pricing, it's going to take time for these studies to get complete. We're one of the leaders in helping our clients with these studies. And as I mentioned before, we hope that these will convert to EPCM projects or other services late in our fiscal year 2018 and really help us for positioning for backlog growth and driving profit growth beginning in 2019. The focus for us is copper and iron ore, and we're seeing activity in both. A lot of activity in Australia and South America specifically, and a few other parts of the world but especially in those two areas, and where we're seeing most of the activity is really replenishing capacity as mine lives come closer to end, we're just seeing a lot of strategic capacity projects which are more replacement capacity, which gives our clients probably the near-term highest return. So it's all about the projects that give them the shortest payback. So as far as the big long-term strategic capacity growth expansions, we're really not seeing a heavy activity on that yet. And so until we see more sustained pricing and even further pricing improvement, we see that most of the efforts will be on these sort of very focused on near-term return on investment capacity replenishment upgrade as long \u2013 as well as some sustained \u2013 sustaining capital type projects. Jerry Revich : Steve, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about really strong momentum in your Infrastructure business. Can you talk about what backlog growth would look like just for Infrastructure, excluding buildings? And what's the opportunity set as you look at 2018 and bid activity compared to what bid activity looked like for 2017 a year ago. Can you just frame that for us? Steve Demetriou : We're still bullish that we should keep the momentum going on the backlog trend that we've seen in our Building & Infrastructure over the last two years. There's always the timing element. So I'm not going to get it down to the quarters, but I would say that as we go through 2018 fiscal year, we're clearly expecting to see solid backlog growth in our global Buildings & Infrastructure business. The North American market is \u2013 remains extremely strong, even though there's still a lot of uncertainty on the whole federal government infrastructure support bill and tax bill, et cetera. The demand is there. The economy's strong. We're strongest in West Coast, Texas, Florida, for example. Robust activity across all sectors of Infrastructure. And you add on top of that a lot of our geographic growth initiatives that are playing out. We announced our Middle East joint venture several quarters ago. We continue to get a lot of positive momentum there that will take some time, but will eventually contribute to our backlog. And so we're pretty excited about it, but it'll play out in sort of different phases across the year. But we definitely are optimistic and confident that we'll see backlog growth in Building & Infrastructure in 2018. Jerry Revich : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Steve or Kevin, backlog growth has really been accelerating in A&T. Is it a function \u2013 you talked about getting away from those rebid losses a couple of years ago. Is it a function of easier comparisons? Is it an accelerated market? Is it really just all share gain for Jacobs at this point? And can you maintain, I mean, you now have double-digit backlog growth in that segment. How should we look at backlog growth in 2018? Can you maintain double-digit backlog growth going forward? And can you just tell us how much the acquisition was in backlog in the quarter in A&T? Steve Demetriou : Yes, so the Aerospace & Technology backlog growth is \u2013 we've just got to say, it's been super impressive. And I \u2013 there's a lot behind it, but I will say the first thing that's driving it is the strategy. Terry Hagen and his team put together a strategy 1.5 years ago that was very focused on the things that we talked about and in a very stable government service spending environment. And so yes, we are executing on that strategy. We're winning share but we're winning share against non-traditional competitors that we've competed against in the past, which means we're widening our scope. We're extending into sectors that we hadn't participated before. And so as we completed the rebid cycle, we talked about really focusing heavily on new business. And so it's getting stronger in the intelligence community. It's getting into this weapon sustainment area, becoming a stronger defense contractor, moving into DOE and other elements of the government. And it's leveraging these small but very strategic acquisitions around Van Dyke and Blue Canopy, which is strengthening our whole Jacobs Connected Enterprise, getting us into more \u2013 the ability to move into cybersecurity and some of the growing pieces of the large government sector spending. So we're very pleased with probably \u2013 I would say we're exceeding the pace of execution against the A&T strategy. And as we move into 2018 again, it's like Building & Infrastructure, it's going to be lumpy, the backlog. A lot of it depends on some of these protested wins coming off and \u2013 from protest and moving into our backlog. And it could happen in the upcoming quarter or it could take a few more quarters. And that will drive some of the backlog growth, but we're also working on several exciting initiatives that we hope will play out. So again, all in all, we see backlog growth in 2018 fiscal year, and we'll just look forward to continuing to demonstrate that. Kevin Berryman : Maybe for Andy, perhaps another comment, just in terms of augmenting Steve's comment on lumpiness in A&T, we do actually have one large rebid that's coming up in 2019. So effectively, what that means is, as we approach 2019, the backlog, we'll start to see some pressure just because we haven't gone through the rebid process yet. And we expect that we'll be successful in that rebid. But that will now be a trail and a \u2013 excuse me, a headwind on the backlog just because as we get to the end of the bid, there's really no \u2013 going to be no backlog and then it will get replenished when the rebid occurs. So there is some stuff going on there. That's really the only thing of note, I think it's important to suggest. So I agree with Steve's comment but there can be some lumpiness because we're starting to see that headwind occur, and then it really is dictated by when the other wins and the protest kind of come to fruition. Andrew Kaplowitz : But Kevin, just to be clear, you think you can still grow backlog from here in A&T even with that headwind in 2018? Is that fair? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Just \u2013 my comment is more about the lumpiness of it. Andrew Kaplowitz : Understand. I mean, Kevin, maybe if I could ask you about CH2 in the sense that, even if I exclude the MOPAC adjustment in the quarter, $88 million of adjusted EBITDA seems pretty high when you look at the history of CH2. Seasonally, it's probably a pretty strong quarter, but maybe if you could comment on, are there \u2013 they've been sort of working on restructuring and improvement just as you guys have, so it would \u2013 seems like a pretty good quarter from them. And then, if there's any color you could give us on the other legacy liability that CH2 has as well. Kevin Berryman : So look, I would just reemphasize everything that we said about the CH2M portfolio of businesses. They have gone through a lot of efforts over the last couple of three years to reposition our portfolio, handle and address some of the legacy issues that we're talking about, take and restructuring and position themselves to be a higher-margin business, all of which we really diligenced in a material manner over the course of the time that we were able to spend with the company. So yes, they are coming out of some of the issues that they had relative to legacy in a much stronger spot then when they were before. So clearly, an improved portfolio, so I would just reemphasize that. As it relates to the other issue, legacy issue, no real new news. That will continue to meander its way through the process. We've said that, that's a long-term issue. We understand what the potential issues are. So no real new news to say on that front. I will say that MOPAC is coming out in a manner that is, if anything, a little bit better than we would have expected, so we're happy about how the team has been executing against that. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : The next question will come from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tahira Afzal : Good morning, guys. So first question and maybe this is more for Kevin. Kevin, it seems like you've included in the suggested adjusted EPS accretion, maybe it seems that there's more than $1 per annum in amortization costs that you're including in there. Would that be kind of correct? Kevin Berryman : No, no. In terms of \u2013 no, no. That \u2013 a $1 would be sizable in addition to, into their already existing depreciation and amortization. So I'm not sure how you got to that number, but it would not be $1. Tahira Afzal : It wouldn't be that high, so\u2026 Kevin Berryman : Remember, Tahira, maybe I can help you, if you remember, we said 25% on a cash accretion basis. So if you take the difference between those two numbers, you're going to get more accurate as it relates to a 15% versus 25% number. Tahira Afzal : Perfect, okay. And Kevin, if you're looking at how that amortization dissipates, is it a very gradual effect, so we shouldn't assume this is the visibility around your adjusted EPS beyond fiscal year 2018? Kevin Berryman : Say again? I'm sorry. I missed the\u2026 Steve Demetriou : Is it a gradual effect or is it \u2013 of the amortization\u2026 Tahira Afzal : Does it sort of \u2013 I guess, I'm just wondering\u2026 Kevin Berryman : Yes, no. Look, we will have an opening balance sheet that incorporates our views of the revised balance sheet, which will incorporate goodwill, it will incorporate the value of intangible assets, and those intangible assets will begin to amortize immediately. So it will basically happen over the course of 2018 as soon as we close. There is a process that we will go through over the course of 2018 where we will look to finalize exactly what the numbers are. Plus we get the company and we have the figures and we're able to do the detailed analysis, there may be some adjustments that are ultimately embedded into that opening balance sheet, but that will be done within the first year and we'll have the revised figures kind of going forward by the end of our fiscal 2018. Tahira Afzal : Got it. Okay. And Steve, just on this Neon City, I'm sure you've been following all the news and headline news there. It seems to play a lot into all the strengths and all the initiatives that you're trying to build within Jacobs on the technology integrated side. Any thoughts around whether this could be a pretty big opportunity for yourself or whether it's going to really take away from some of the other areas where the Saudis have been spending? Steve Demetriou : No, it definitely is right in the heart of what we're doing with regard to our joint venture there and so it's exciting to see that unfold. I was out in Saudi Arabia a couple of weeks ago and talking to the \u2013 some of the Neon executives. And it was \u2013 I'm thrilled to see that the head of that is my former colleague when I was in the aluminum business. So Klaus Kleinfeld is leading that, and he and I have worked together in the past, so we're excited to be a big part of that as that unfolds. The question is again, like anything with regard to that major initiative, is how quickly will it ramp up in funding. And a lot of it's probably going to be driven by unleashing some of the cash from Aramco with their IPO and redirecting some of that to drive that growth, but pretty exciting stuff. Tahira Afzal : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will come from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Good morning. I guess, two questions. One, Kevin, on the organic growth, I think you said for the year, Jacobs is expected to be down year-over-year. I guess I'm just surprised, given the backlog growth that you've seen this year as well as some of the comps that you have in the first half of the year. So if you could just give some color on how you're thinking about that and how we think about the high end versus sort of the low end in that, versus your longer-term targets to grow 2% to 4% on the organic business. And then my second question is on just the P&C margins. It's the only business that's not hitting your target margins at this point. So what we need to see to get those margins up? Is it just volume? So any color there. Thank you. Kevin Berryman : So the comments about the revenue, Jamie, thanks for the question, really is only as it relates to Q1. So I think it's ramping up and we do expect to see growth for the year, organic growth, excluding the impact of the CH2M acquisition. So we do expect that for the course of the balance of 2018. So clearly, it's a Q1 comment only. So that's the first point. Second point, on Petroleum & Chemicals. Look, we're not going to \u2013 look, we're excited actually about the margin profile of Petroleum & Chemicals because of some of the challenges that we've seen in the market. And so they have, in a very, very tough environment, actually improved their operating profit margins over the last couple of years and have more than overcome a pretty significant fall in revenue, which a lot of folks have had to experience in this business. So to your point, I think it really is, we've now reset the bar on our cost structure. And when that business does ultimately start to see some momentum and growth, you'll see some improvements in margin. And the business is continuing to target higher-margin work so we would expect that, that will continue to evolve over time as well. Jamie Cook : Thank you. I will get back in queue. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Steve, Kevin and John. Steve, I was impressed with your comments in your prepared remarks relative to the loss making write-downs or the write-downs on projects down 50%, I think you said year-over-year, relative to what you presented at your Investor Day last December. Where do we stand on towards getting to zero? And as you look at the \u2013 as you had an indication from what CH2M fill is going through with your negotiations and discussing all the offices, is there a similar idea relative to CH2 where we can see that type of positive performance once they get under the Jacobs umbrella? Steve Demetriou : Yes, Mike, thanks for the comment on that, and we're extremely pleased with the progress. We still have a lot more work to do because there's a couple of different metrics we're driving. One is the write-downs, but the other is holding onto the as-sold margin all the way through projects, and that's a, kind of a broader, bigger opportunity for us that is \u2013 we're still in the early stages. So we think that, kind of going back to my comment around operating profit margin improvement over the next several years, one of the reasons we're confident is, we're just going to stay relentlessly focused on upgrading our tools and our discipline and standardization across the company to improve project delivery program, delivery excellence and drive operating profit improvement, because of that, look at now, especially on the margin side. CH2M, a couple of years ago, launched a very similar transformation effort. That's one of the things that excites us as we got into the due diligence and now into the integration process, that we both have had a very common path forward over the last couple of years and really refocusing the company on discipline, accountability, really looking at tools and project delivery excellence. And so I think that we're just going to pick up on that immediately upon close. We've actually been working it during this planning stage. And yes, we do see significant opportunities on their side as well. And really, I don't want to say we're going to bring Jacobs' processes to make them better. I think what we're really going to do is take the best of both sides and accelerate \u2013 further accelerate and stretch ourselves to do even better than we thought we could do on our own, by putting the power of the two companies' transformation processes together. Michael Dudas : I'm assuming that the IMO team has the organization ready to hit Day one, to run forward as a combined company. Any thought about the changing and maybe new business opportunities within some of the enhanced processes or enhance the markets that CH2, especially on the water transportation side, that can maybe lift more in the backlog or order opportunities as we \u2013 as they get their \u2013 get set for 2018? Steve Demetriou : Yes, so first of all on your comment, I've been involved with a lot of acquisitions, including some major ones, and I am \u2013 this is easy for me to say because I'm running the company, but this is the most impressive integration process that I've experienced and I've seen across M&A and going in other markets. And a lot of it is lessons learned from not only what Jacobs and CH2M have done in the past, good and bad, but also the industry and also just broader M&A. We've got a great external consultant helping us. We've got tremendous leadership on both sides, led by Gary Mandel on Jacobs' side and Lisa Glatch and so on the CH2M side, both senior executives that are plucked out of the day-to-day business to invest in this integration process, which I think very few companies would do that. And it's clearly paying dividends for us to what we believe will get us off to a very fast start on integration because of all the work that we've been doing since August. And the team is extensive, with members of both companies on a variety of subteams in this whole Integration Management Office. As far as the revenue synergies, which you talk about, we've defined the $150 million of cost synergies, but what really excites us is the growth opportunity. And there are numerous examples of where we can put the power of two companies together. But what CH2M really brings for us, that will accelerate our ability to grow that we couldn't do on our own is really their innovation technology culture, climate change initiatives going on across all of our markets, but especially in Building & Infrastructure and the likes of some of our industrial markets will be huge for us. The \u2013 taking their water and environmental leadership positions across our global platform in a much bigger way into mining and oil and gas and chemicals. And when you think of oil prices improving, one of the eventual beneficiaries is going to be upstream. And even though upstream is not a core market for us, our integrated energy clients that will be doing upstream projects will demand significant water services. And that's where we are already hearing exciting feedback from a lot of our major clients on the fact that we'll have the CH2M industry-leading water capabilities and environmental capabilities. And so those are a couple of examples, which clearly we're going to be driving for future backlog growth and revenue synergies. Michael Dudas : Thanks, and just one quick one, final one, for me. Kevin, any seasonality of the CH2 business relative to Jacobs? Is it similar in cadence or is there any defers or delays, et cetera, relative to timing, whether it's in \u2013 from a cash flow or from a business standpoint? Kevin Berryman : Look, I think ultimately, probably the only thing to say is that their Q4 is more like our Q1, just because that tends to be a quarter where there's a lot of holidays. So other than that, I really wouldn't venture to guess any or give you any guidance until we get our hands on this and really dig in and understand it. But I would make that comment now and give you more color later on. Michael Dudas : Well, enjoy the upcoming holidays, guys. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andy Wittmann : Great, thanks. And Kevin, just to start off with some cleanup questions here. In the guide for 2018, is there any gains or discrete tax items that we should be aware of? And I don't think you gave the tax rate that's underlying that, or that core fiscal 2018 guidance. I think maybe that would be helpful to get us in the right direction. Kevin Berryman : Yes, look, Andy, we continue to target a low 30s kind of tax rate, which I think is pretty much where we ended up pretty close in this year, not exactly, but close to it. So we're pretty much in the low 30s, low end of the 30s. Andy Wittmann : Perfect. And no items that are notable in the guidance? Kevin Berryman : Yes, no. Look, they're probably, who knows what ends up happening? We'll always have puts and takes as it relates to that, but we've considered this to be a normal operating level of taxes. Andy Wittmann : Great. And then just on the SG&A. I guess, adjusted SG&A year-over-year is up $32 million, about 120 basis points difference. You mentioned in the comments, business development, legal, IT. I think you also mentioned later incentive compensation. Can you maybe just help us understand which one of those \u2013 which of those costs were more material in the year-over-year delta in SG&A cost, just so that we can get a sense of how much of this is likely to stick around and embedded in that 2018 guidance? Kevin Berryman : So if you remember, we had $30 million of strategic investments that occurred in 2017. But on top of that, our incentive comp is higher as well plus the other items that I talked about. So certainly, some of that was offset by the savings associated with our restructuring, obviously. But we still feel like, as we go into 2018 and we're transitioning to a growth environment that we'll have continued investments in business development costs to help drive the growth agenda going forward because it's clear that momentum is gaining. And so there will be incremental investments that we're talking about in 2018. So I think that the incentive comp is a good number for this year. And so it is certainly, probably, along with the strategic investments, the two biggest pieces where we were seeing investments in 2018 \u2013 excuse me, 2017. Andy Wittmann : Thank you. That's helpful. Can you just help us with the backlog contribution, the revenue contribution from Blue Canopy in the quarter as well? Kevin Berryman : We didn't disclose that, but look, the vast majority of the increase in backlog was associated with the new wins that we've discussed. So keeping in mind, if you think about, Andy, the fact that we actually don't include the full $4.6 billion in our backlog, we only kind of take the first couple of years, as Steve outlined, those are big numbers there. And so consequently, if you add that, it's even a smaller piece. So it was not a material part of the increase at all. Andy Wittmann : Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Rob Norfleet of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead. Rob Norfleet : Good morning. Just a quick question on the P&C segment. I know the focus right now is obviously on downstream, some of the refinery terminal work and obviously, we're seeing some strength in chemicals. But can you discuss a little bit, in terms of what prospects, at least, you're seeing an upstream? I mean, I think some of your competitors have cited that feed work has been picking up and that some of these deferred projects seem like they're, at least, coming back a little bit. But if you can provide a little color around that, and I guess, secondly to that, can you grow P&C backlog with upstream still being in a very challenged position? Or do you need that business to start seeing an increase in order rates for overall backlog to improve? Steve Demetriou : Sure. Thanks, Rob. I'll go in reverse that, we do expect to see backlog growth in 2018 versus 2017. Again, timing will depend on when some of these wins happen, but we're pretty confident on that. And it will be driven primarily by what I said in my opening remarks around downstream, petrochemicals. We're well positioned on some interesting opportunities across the globe and also around maintenance, turnaround activities. We are seeing, as the market is getting better profitability, they're starting to address things that were delayed. So things like maintenance and even turnarounds that have been pushed off from 2017, we now are seeing a lot of those accelerate in 2018 because they're getting more confident in the overall market. So that's what gives us confidence in backlog growth going forward. As far as upstream goes, we are not depending on upstream in our backlog when I talk about backlog growth. I would say for us, that's upside. And as I mentioned before, upstream strength will help us in several areas. Most of our big integrated clients have held back even some downstream investments because of the pressure on upstream. And so, therefore, as that \u2013 as their overall profitability includes when upstream improvement occurs, they're going to spread that capital across wherever they're making their best return on investments. And some of that will still come from some of these big strategic refining and downstream chemical projects. We are strong in the Middle East, first and foremost, and Aramco's announced a 10% increase in their CapEx for 2018. We're one of the leading players there. We do participate on the upstream side. We're in the mix for some very interesting projects that we hope to announce soon. And so that should be one of the areas that you would see us benefit on the upstream side. And we continue to see some interesting prospects in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We have a strong position in Louisiana offshore platform work. Some of that activity's starting to pick up. And so Calgary's another area where we're seeing some renewed strength. We're seeing global opportunities that we can execute out of Calgary in our upstream group. So we are starting to see some activity but it's not the major driver for what I'm talking about when I am confident about backlog growth in 2018 in P&C. Rob Norfleet : Great, that's helpful. Just a quick question for Kevin. Post the closure of the deal, your pro forma leverage ratio is going to be around 1.9 times. Given the free cash flow generation between you and CH2M, clearly, you're going to be able to repay debt, as you mentioned fairly quickly. I guess, I just wanted to understand, what is your optimal or target leverage ratio? Because again, it seems like you can pretty quickly retire some of the debt here, and certainly, you have a lot of balance sheet capability. Kevin Berryman : Yes, look, we've talked about this in the past, Rob. We've targeted this one to two times EBITDA number, and we're not too far above that. The other item that we will likely be thinking about over the course of the next month or two as we approach the close is locking in some longer-term money, which then ties back into a more stable, let's say, efficient balance sheet where we're having some long-term money locking in at the lower rates that we see today. So one to two times is the short answer, and probably looking to execute shortly after close to lock in some long-term money as well. Rob Norfleet : Great. I appreciate it, and congrats on early quarter. Kevin Berryman : Let\u2019s make this last one. Operator : Certainly. The last question then will come from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard : Good morning, guys. So given you've seen such a ramp in your A&T backlog, can you help us think with thinking about how quickly this backlog should be converted into revenue versus history? I mean, it seems like your contracts are getting a little bit longer, so I just wanted to make sure that we're correct on that. And then just going back to the $850 million under protest, can you just talk about how chunky that is? I mean, is it one or two projects? And \u2013 I mean, how should we think about the timing in terms of whether the majority of that will potentially get booked in the first quarter, assuming you're successful on the protest? Steve Demetriou : Right. So good question on the conversion and, it ranges depending upon the project. But I'd say some of them are \u2013 get converted within a couple of months, two to three months. Others will take up to six months to really get going and starting to generate profitability for us. With regard to the backlog that's being protested, it's \u2013 there are several projects, the largest one being the SOCOM project that was announced. And \u2013 but they \u2013 there are several that are over $100 million, so it's not overly dependent on one. But clearly, the \u2013 that one I just mentioned is the largest. And so we're focused on everyone, but I'd say there's a what, a handful, Kevin, of these protest of projects? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Chad Dillard : Got it. And then switching over to the B&I segment, can you speak to where this business is in terms of utilization today? And just given that you have a pretty healthy backlog, where you expect that to go as we look towards 2018? And just how to think about the margin comps over a year-over-year basis? Steve Demetriou : Yes. So what we love about the B&I business, it's very diverse. And so the things that we see, backlog growth opportunity, aviation continues to be strong across the globe. And we're in the mix of many of the projects. We just won a major one in the U.S. that we haven't formally announced yet, but we'll \u2013 is clearly helping our backlog. But we \u2013 so aviation is one. The whole transportation sector for us clearly helping our backlog. But we \u2013 so aviation is one. The whole transportation sector for us, rail, highways, as we take on the CH2M acquisition, will broaden that obviously with water capability, ports and marines and many other parts of the business. And then the Buildings side, we continue to see strength across the globe in our Buildings sector in the U.S., the government sector on the Buildings side. K-12 is doing well for us. And data center opportunities are pretty robust. So it's pretty widespread. And then the geographic expansion for us is something that we still believe is untapped opportunity for us, where we're still very heavily focused in the U.S., UK, Australia. By the way, Australia continues to be extremely positive for us. A lot of the key projects we've been working on look like they're going to get funded, and hopefully, we'll have a winning streak in that area that will continue. But geographic expansion into the Middle East, we're looking at parts of Africa. Our overall Asia Pacific strategy, still in its early strategic days and other geographic expansion opportunities. So we're not overly dependent on one area and we're excited about the prospects. Chad Dillard : Thank you, guys. Operator : And Mr. Demetriou, would you like to offer some closing comments at this time? Steve Demetriou : I just want to thank everyone in the investment community for listening to the quarterly call today. Happy holidays and look forward to talking to you soon. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after this date of this presentation to confirm to actual results, except as required by applicable law. Please now turn to Slide 3 for a review of the agenda for today\u2019s call. I would like to note a few items in regards to our presentation and remarks today. Our results reported today include a two-week stub period from CH2M, which closed on December 15. During the presentation, we will be referring to Jacobs-only and CH2M-only results, which describes the stand-alone performance of each business for December quarter to provide transparency into periods and trends when comparing prior periods.  We have previously announced that we\u2019ll be moving to three segment lines of business reporting structure as part of our integration of the CH2M business. These three segments will be; Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear; Buildings, Infrastructure, Advanced Facilities; and Energy, Chemicals and Resources. We expect the transition to this new line of business structure to be completed by the end of Q2.  However, today, we\u2019ll be discussing our segment results based on the current four lines of business structure. Our reported results in our press release and those included on Form 10-K filed this morning include the two weeks of CH2M operations in our overall financials.  Now turning to the agenda. Steve will begin with a recap of the first quarter results, including a market review for each of our line of businesses and provide an update on the CH2M integration. Kevin will then provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet, capital allocation strategy. Steve will then provide our outlook for the fiscal year, along with some closing remarks, and then we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. With that, I\u2019ll now pass it over to our Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Jon. Welcome, everyone, to our Fiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Earnings Call. Before discussing our financial results, I\u2019d like to begin by reinforcing the priorities that we have set for the company. These are to further demonstrate our winning culture of safety, integrity and client centricity, to continue to strengthen our industry-leading quality and delivery, to progress our diversification into higher-growth, high-margin programs and projects; and of course, relentlessly drive a successful integration of CH2M, combining the best of both organizations to achieve our committed earnings growth and cash generation targets. By achieving these objectives, we expect to further differentiate Jacobs competitively, retain and attract the industry\u2019s foremost talent and generate superior value for our stakeholders and society.  Now turning to our 2018 fiscal year first quarter results. We continued to benefit from strong end-market demand across both our Aerospace & Technology and Buildings & Infrastructure lines of business, and we experienced modestly improved fundamentals in our petroleum, chemicals and mining sectors.  First quarter Jacobs-only backlog was relatively flat at $19.6 billion, versus the prior quarters record-high backlog, but up $1.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. This reflects the fact that three out of four of our lines of business posted year-over-year backlog growth. It\u2019s also important to note that our quarter-end backlog continued to exclude the impact of close to $850 million of previous awards that remained under protest at the end of the first quarter.  From a P&L standpoint, Jacobs revenue, excluding CH2M, was up 3% versus the prior year. Total gross margin was solid at 17.7%, up over 100 basis points from last year\u2019s first quarter, as we continue to deliver on our strategy to drive improved project execution and shift our portfolio to higher-value business.  Adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 increased 13% year-over-year. Kevin will cover the components of EPS, including a bridge to GAAP EPS in his remarks. And of course, during the quarter, we closed on our transformational CH2M acquisition on December 15.  I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019re off to a solid start, capturing targeted cost synergies and positioning our combined company for additional revenue and earnings growth opportunities.  Turning to our first quarter backlog performance on Slide 5. We\u2019re pleased with our progress, following a record fourth quarter. Excluding CH2M, the mix of professional services backlog remain consistent with last quarter. We continued to win higher-value contracts as demonstrated by gross margin and backlog increasing by approximately 200 basis points versus the first quarter last year.  From a line of business perspective, Aerospace & Technology continued to post strong growth in backlog, while Buildings & Infrastructure also maintained a solid performance on a year-over-year basis. And our Petroleum & Chemicals and Industrial line of businesses improved their trajectory as certain end markets began to show signs of recovery.  We\u2019re also pleased to note that CH2M backlog grew over 18% versus prior year on an adjusted basis to $6.6 billion, with gross margin percentage materially higher than the Jacobs-only backlog. The main reason for this higher margin is that more than 80% of the CH2M backlog is made up of higher-value technology, environmental, water, transportation and advanced facility sectors. I\u2019ll now discuss each line of business in more detail, beginning with Aerospace & Technology on Slide 6. Our A&T business continued to demonstrate strong execution as first quarter backlog, excluding CH2M, increased 23% year-over-year and was up versus last quarter\u2019s record-high level. And this latest A&T backlog does not yet include two significant awards that cleared the protest process in early January.  The first one cleared is for enterprise operations and maintenance services for SITEC, which is Special Operations Forces Acquisitions, Technology and Logistics supporting the U.S. Special Operations Command. And the second award cleared was JITC, a contract that provide test and evaluation services to the Defense Information Systems Agency.  These two newly cleared awards will add approximately $450 million to our second quarter backlog. At that time, there will still remain nearly $400 million of awards from our previous wins at Army\u2019s Yuma Proving Ground and U.S. Corps of Engineering Shallow Land Disposal that will not be put into backlog until they, too, clear the protest process.  As we mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings call, we also have a large confidential contract renewal opportunity pending in 2019. For the remainder of this year, we\u2019ll experience a partial offset to backlog growth of approximately $100 million per quarter as we continue to burn revenue from this contract until the potential multiyear rebid award reenters our backlog in fiscal 2019. From a strategic standpoint, one of the key long-term growth drivers of our A&T business is the ability to capture adjacent opportunities in high-value technology systems development, security and operations. Through organic investments and bolt-on acquisitions that have added complementary capabilities and unique customer relationships, our A&T business has become a preeminent, multibillion-dollar technology solutions provider.  An example of this is the $4.6 billion win with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency that we announced last quarter. This mission-critical contract maintains the agency\u2019s enterprise-wide communications and IT infrastructure. It also includes modeling and simulation as well as systems integration for emerging technology. These wins are expected to be a major driver for profit growth as we progress through this fiscal year. Another key pillar of our Aerospace & Technology strategy is to become a Tier 1 nuclear and environmental services provider. The addition of CH2M\u2019s nuclear and environmental business catapults us into a leading position. In many instances, these nuclear opportunities are highly selective multiyear government contracts worth billions of dollars, often decades-long in duration.  In addition to major government programs, we are driving our digital expertise across the entire Jacobs portfolio, which we refer to as Jacobs Connected Enterprise. For example, within A&T, we\u2019re working with an automotive customer on cyber-penetration testing for its autonomous vehicles.  So in summary, the A&T business has built a solid foundation by executing against a focused strategy and is positioned well to deliver double-digit profit growth in fiscal 2018.  Now on to Slide 7 to discuss our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business. Our global B&I team delivered another solid quarter with operating profit, excluding CH2M, up over 30% versus last year, along with revenue and backlog increasing during the same period.  More importantly, the gross profit in our first quarter Jacobs-only B&I backlog continued to trend up on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, demonstrating success in our strategy to focus on high-growth, higher-margin opportunities.  Underpinning our success has been a strong focus on what we see as the big three infrastructure priorities; water, transportation and resilience. While the U.S. is front and center in the news with its infrastructure legislation priorities, we are seeing the same positive momentum globally to modernize and expand infrastructure. As a global leader across all sectors, Jacobs is well-positioned to capitalize on infrastructure trends in the coming decades. Water is fundamental to the global economy. And in many mature countries such as the U.S. and Western Europe, water infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life. And in emerging economies, we need to continue to develop new infrastructure to serve millions of people who lack access to clean water and sanitation. Together with CH2M, Jacobs is now positioned as a top global leader in all aspects of water, including designing, building and managing supply, delivery, treatment and reuse as well as initiatives to enhance excess waterways. For example, in the first quarter, we were awarded the design and engineering services for expansion of the South Fort Collins, Colorado sanitation district water reclamation facility where safely cleaned and treated wastewater is returned to the ecosystem.  This market is also one where, in addition to traditional engineering services, we are delivering total design build as well as operations and maintenance services for urban water systems. Additionally, we are in advanced discussions with clients in countries such as India where there are significant needs to provide the water infrastructure to ensure clean, safe resources to serve a growing population.  In the transportation sector, we continue to see strong demand around the world, especially in highways, rails and airports. Investments in transportation are viewed by governments as one of the most important drivers of unlocking economic investment and productivity.  During the first quarter, we had a number of key wins on the transportation sector. In Melbourne, Australia, we were selected to carry out the engineering design as part of the design build team for the West Gate Tunnel project, one of the most iconic programs in the country\u2019s history.  We landed significant wins for Highways England\u2019s Manchester Northwest Quadrant program and the National Transport Authority Ireland for the Dublin Metro North expansion. And in the U.S., we were awarded the program management for the third track expansion of the Long Island Railroad. In combination with CH2M, we\u2019re positioned as a leading force, delivering world-class solutions for global transportation requirements. We have a pipeline flushed with opportunities and are poised to capitalize on continued growth in the transportation sector globally. As we have seen recently in weather extremes and natural disasters around the world, the demand for resiliency program has never been greater, given the rise of urban population migration and the catastrophic impacts such events have on major metropolitan areas.  In addition to recovery efforts, this phenomenon also is driving investments in protective and sustainable infrastructure. We\u2019re helping governments around the world address these challenges, leading major efforts such as New York City\u2019s East Side Coastal Resiliency program, the Port of San Francisco waterfront project and delivery of a utility-scale, 200-megawatt solar plant that will provide sustainable energy in New South Wales, Australia. Our B&I team is also accelerating our strategy to bring digital innovation to clients globally for our Jacobs Connected Enterprise platform. We continue to see examples of success. Among them, we developed a proprietary geographic information system technology called ProjectMapper, which is a cloud-based subscription solution currently being leveraged at multiple transportation customers in the U.K.  In summary, our B&I business is performing extremely well, and we are squarely positioned in priority sectors and geographies for long-term profitable growth.  Moving to Slide 8. Our Industrial line of business realized a decrease in backlog compared to the fourth quarter as we continue to work off two sizable life sciences projects. Backlog was $2.6 billion, down approximately $200 million from the prior quarter, but up over $100 million versus last year, driven by increased field services work in the U.S. Based on improved operational and commercial execution, gross margin in our first quarter Industrial backlog is up year-over-year. In life sciences, as the wave of bulk biotech expansion ebbs, growth continues to shift to cell and gene therapy where we are capturing increased new business. We are also expecting capacity expansion in the immune disorder market, driven by the needs of an aging population. As we integrate CH2M, we\u2019re excited about the opportunities to leverage our combined expertise in life sciences, semiconductors and other advanced facilities to increase the pipeline of new sales prospects and drive accelerated profitable growth synergies. Our Mining & Minerals business continues to pick up with strengthening metal prices, particularly copper, driving modest increases in client investment. We have won several frame agreements and studies that we expect to convert to full execution in late 2018 and into 2019. A rise in activity by our field services team in the first quarter involved several large planned turnarounds as well as two significant emergency outages by core clients in the U.S. and Canada. Clients seeking to reduce overhead costs are bidding large multisite maintenance contracts. Our size and expertise positions us well for these opportunities, and we have achieved several strategic wins in the long-term maintenance category, specifically in North America.  And now to our Petroleum & Chemicals business on Slide 9. While our revenue in first quarter P&C backlog, excluding CH2M, was down slightly versus last year, the gross margin in backlog increased year-over-year. I\u2019m very pleased with how our P&C team have held backlog steady through the oil market downturn over the last several years. This is a direct result of our team\u2019s solid execution against our strategy to focus on improving project delivery and enhancing the mix of new business.  As we move forward, we\u2019re now experiencing what appears to be the beginning of modest improvements in industry demand. In summary, global upstream and midstream CapEx spend are expected to improve based on oil prices stabilizing at three year highs. Within refining, regulatory factors are continuing to drive client capital spending.  In Asia and Middle East, there are new greenfield refining projects. And in the U.S., we\u2019re seeing signs that some refiners will take advantage of the benefit from tax changes that allow for the immediate write-off of CapEx investments.  Overall, chemicals continues to remain a strong market. In the U.S., as the first wave of petrochemical facilities are commissioned, we\u2019re seeing clients discussing and moving forward on the next cycle of petrochemicals facilities. So our focus in Petroleum & Chemicals will continue to be on global downstream opportunities in refining and chemicals, on continuing to strengthen project execution and leveraging our digital expertise deep into our customer base.  Recent examples of our execution against this strategy include combining our strong consultancy, strategic sales groups and multi-office execution model to win global projects that leverage resources in other regions, such as our key wins with Saudi Aramco Zuluf and Canada Kuwait Petrochemical Corporation. We continue to progress our existing renewable energy projects. We recently signed a three year engineering services agreement with the energy arm of a company looking to build wind power generation capacity in Canada. From a Jacobs Connected Enterprise standpoint, we were successful in capturing the network and cyber infrastructure build-out for a downstream customer\u2019s project site that in the past would typically be considered adjacent IT scope of work handled by other IT contractors.  In another Jacobs Connected Enterprise example, at one of our projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast, we\u2019ve deployed network personnel and material tracking as well as digitized safety processes, which historically were pen and paper-based. We expect this infusion of digital technology to improve site efficiency, safety and provide us with further analytics when building and bidding future projects.  From a CH2M cross-selling standpoint, we are excited about the opportunity to now incorporate industry-leading water and environmental capabilities into our P&C client offering. As an example, just recently, a downstream customer in the U.S. awarded Jacobs the pre-FEED work for steam reliability and optimization project where we are bringing our new combined Jacobs expertise.  In summary, we\u2019re pleased with the way our global P&C team have weathered a challenging energy market by focusing on high-quality execution of our ongoing projects, continuing to strengthen client relationships and maintaining a strong financial profile. As the energy markets recover, we are well-positioned from both a strategic and from a financial perspective to drive operating leverage in our P&C business.  On Slide 10, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the very important integration of CH2M. Immediately after we announced the transformational acquisition of CH2M in August, we created an Integration Management Office, the IMO. By the time we completed the deal on December 15, the IMO was comprised of 125 employees from both organizations, working full-time alongside a leading management consultant firm to focus on all aspects of integration planning. The IMO working with joint leadership have focused on seamlessly combining legacy Jacobs and CH2M cultures and capturing synergies that we expect to create significant shareholder value. We know the difference between success and failures of mergers and acquisitions typically lies in the ability to get employees of both organizations aligned and excited, not only to ensure they understand our new combined company strategy, but also to get them actively engaged in delivering it.  To this end, over the last five months, our executive leaders have made a concerted effort to host town halls at locations across both businesses and around the world. We\u2019ve taken time to personally communicate about our strategy and the stronger new value proposition we\u2019re creating together.  Based on these efforts and regular surveys we\u2019re conducting, employees are responding favorably, demonstrating genuine excitement and motivation to contribute to a better future for our company and our stakeholders. We have made it our priority to maintain and build on this momentum in employee engagement, and our clients also are responding positively. A key metric for us is closely monitoring talent retention. And I\u2019m very pleased that since announcing and closing this major acquisition, voluntary attrition levels are actually trending below pre-acquisition levels. And our employees are driving a lot of excitement in the marketplace, including social media sharing. And today, we\u2019re attracting five times as many job views, supporting our talent acquisition efforts to meet client service requirements in our combined growing backlog.  On the financial side of the integration, Kevin will cover details associated with our cost synergy initiative and deal targets. I do want to note that we\u2019re solidly on track to achieve the cost savings we communicated at the announcement of the transaction. More importantly, we are seeing early-on evidence of maintaining strong focus on high-quality project execution around the globe in achieving sales bookings targets previously established by both companies.  Our teams have exceeded expectations on how quickly they are coming together to realize revenue growth synergies, leveraging unique capabilities that we now can cross-sell to new and existing clients. As our sales teams complete their assessment of prospects across our pipelines, their findings so far confirm our original expectation that we have minimal revenue dis-synergies, thanks to limited overlap in our businesses and more importantly, positive complementary potential for growth synergies.  From a top line standpoint, we\u2019re putting the framework in place to drive revenue growth opportunities. Some examples are cross-selling water capabilities into oil, gas and petrochemicals is already gaining traction, with growing opportunities identified in the pipeline for fiscal 2018 and 2019. In advanced facilities, we see specific opportunities to deliver full EPCM across the high technology and semiconductor sectors. And within transportation, building on recent wins, we believe our combined expertise and scale will result in higher win rates. So now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Steve. And moving to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 year. Before I start to review our results, I would like to reiterate what Jon said earlier that our reported results include only 15 days of CH2M in the quarter. Please note that we have also footnoted the stub period contribution to our reported metrics within our earnings slide presentation, all of which is posted to our Investor Relations website. So during the quarter, Jacobs legacy revenue continued to gain momentum, growing 3% year-over-year, driven by a strong 10% increase in higher margin professional services revenue. The increase in Jacobs revenue was driven by solid performance in our Aerospace & Technology and Buildings & Infrastructure lines of businesses, offset by some softness in our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business, which, as Steve highlighted, was driven by the continued challenges in their end markets. When including the stub period impact of CH2M into our results for the quarter, our revenue actually grew nearly 8% versus the year-ago quarter. Overall gross margins, including the CH2M stub period impact, were 17.7%. And Jacobs legacy gross margins continued to be strong at 17.6%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. While corporate Q1 G&A costs were up year-over-year, approximately half of the increase was driven by some discreet accrual adjustments, a partial lump sum pension settlement and increased legal fees. Our medical costs are also expected to be up year-over-year, which will put upward pressure on corporate costs for the balance of the year. While GAAP operating profit margin was 1.7% due to the CH2M-related acquisition and integration costs and a onetime noncash charge associated with the change in the U.S. tax law, our adjusted operating profit margin was 4.9%, up nearly 20 basis points year-over-year. When excluding the stub period impact from CH2M, adjusted operating profit margin would have been 5%, the fourth straight quarter of at least 5% for the Jacobs legacy business. GAAP EPS was $0.02, down year-over-year and driven by the onetime $0.23 charge related to tax reform and the $0.52 of CH2M-related restructuring charges to achieve synergies, professional fees and other integration-related expenses, including change in control costs. When excluding these discrete costs that are noted above, our adjusted EPS was $0.77. Included in the $0.77 is a negative $0.01 contribution from CH2M\u2019s stub period results, representing positive operational contribution, which was offset by the incremental interest and share count due to the transaction. The immature amount of CH2M earnings contribution was aligned with our expectation for the short stub period, given that the last two weeks of the calendar year typically include significantly less billable days than a normal two-week period due to the holidays. Our quarter also included a onetime charge of $0.02 associated with a partial lump sum pension settlement. These incremental charges were offset by a lower tax rate in the quarter of 25%, which was driven by the change in the U.S. tax law. Importantly, all of these items were included in our $0.77 result, effectively offsetting each other, leaving an underlying operational performance indicative of building momentum. You\u2019ll also see this later when we talk about our LOB results and their strong margin and profit results.  Before moving on to the next slide, I would like to quickly comment on the expected ongoing impact of the recent change in the U.S. tax law. We do expect that our effective tax rate will approach 25% now for the year, given the new law, and the result \u2013 and as a result, we expect that our EPS for the year will benefit by approximately $0.30 due to the change. Steve will comment on this later when he discusses our revised outlook for the year. The tax benefit, however, will be somewhat muted in our second quarter due to the timing of some planned discrete costs of approximately $0.10 in the quarter. To be clear, these discrete incremental costs are embedded on our outlook for the full year that Steve will talk to. Now let me turn to Slide 12 to discuss CH2M\u2019s fourth quarter and calendar 2017 results. As a reminder, CH2M\u2019s revenue and backlog year-over-year growth are impacted by the deconsolidation of their Chalk River joint venture and the adjustment of the MOPAC and Inpex projects. We have provided a reconciliation of the CH2M reported to adjusted figures in the appendix of our investor presentation. Excluding the impacts of these items noted, CH2M legacy backlog grew over 18% year-over-year and was driven by an increase in large multiyear U.S. federal program management and operation and maintenance awards. Adjusted revenue was stable for the December quarter and down 1% versus a year ago and was negatively impacted by the private sector oil and gas business and, to a lesser extent, the national government business. This softness was almost entirely offset by an increase in the state and local business, primarily water and transportation. For the full calendar year 2017, underlying operational EBITDA was in line with our expectations of $106 million on a GAAP basis and $320 million on an adjusted basis. It should be noted that during the December quarter, we took the opportunity to align the CH2M project portfolio to our risk standards, which did put some additional pressure on the results for CH2M in the fourth quarter. As such, we believe the CH2M business is positioned well from a backlog and profitability standpoint to successfully execute against our expected \u2013 expectations for the nine-month period \u2013 remaining period for our fiscal 2018. We are therefore maintaining our nine-month accretion expectation from CH2M of $0.30 to $0.35, excluding any impact from the lower corporate tax rate. Flipping to Slide 13. Let\u2019s look at the sequential trends in revenue and gross margin in more detail. As we have highlighted in the past, we continue to be focused on disciplined project execution, reducing write-downs and targeting higher margin opportunities throughout the cycles in our end markets. We have certainly communicated previously that we would be expecting a building momentum in our revenue in 2018. During the quarter, this trend certainly played out in our results as we again maintained strong gross margins approaching 18%, while increasing revenue versus year ago on a reported and organic basis. So turning to Slide 14, let\u2019s discuss the line of business sectors. To ensure the most accurate trend analysis, we have excluded the very short two-week stub period for CH2M from each of our lines of businesses and will only talk to the Jacobs line of business financials for the quarter. Consistent with our transition to growth in 2008, every line of business delivered absolute level of profit growth year-over-year. The improving performance, combined with the continued improvement in operating margin across three of the four lines of business, gives a clear indication that our disciplined and more focused profitable growth strategy is taking hold. Regarding A&T, while they showed a slight reduction in OP margin for the quarter, this was a result of their ramping up against the large federal wins that will build revenue momentum over the balance of the year. Throughout fiscal 2018, we expect A&T to maintain operating margins in the 8% to 9% range, while accelerating revenue growth from the recent strong backlog performance. This combination of profitable revenue growth is expected to drive meaningful improvement in operating profit. Operating profit for our B&I business increased 32.5% year-over-year to $51 million with margins of 8%, up 150 basis points from the year-ago quarter. We believe there\u2019s an opportunity to expand CH2M\u2019s state and local operating margins to be more in line with our B&I business both organically and additionally through cost synergies. Meanwhile, our Industrial line of business operating profit increased nearly 52% to $38 million, representing a significant increase of over 170 basis points to their current operating profit margin of 5.1%. This increase was driven by low single-digit revenue growth while expanding gross margins due to improved project performance. Lastly, our P&C business, Petroleum & Chemicals, saw a 24% increase in operating income to $28 million despite a year-over-year decrease in revenue as gross margins expanded by close to 200 basis points. As a result, margins again improved year-over-year by nearly 120 basis points to 4.9%. So before moving on to the next slide and while not shown specifically on this slide, I would reiterate our non-allocated corporate overhead increased $24 million year-over-year, which offset some of the impact of the LOB profit growth. As I\u2019ve previously stated, half of this increase was related to costs that we do not expect to be recurring on a go-forward basis. Regardless, our overall adjusted operating profit improved 8%, and adjusted operating margin increased nearly 30 basis points year-over-year for the legacy Jacobs business to 5.0%. On Slide 15, now let me provide an update on restructuring and acquisition costs. As Steve alluded to, we remain on track to achieve $150 million of targeted cost synergies we outlined, with an estimated cost to achieve of $225 million. Through the end of Q1, we have incurred approximately $37 million of the $225 million in cost to achieve these synergies. These initial costs are largely labor-related through the actions taken through the end of Q1. As of the end of Q1, we have achieved a run rate of just over 25% of the expected synergies of $150 million. By the end of the year, we expect to achieve a run rate savings of approximately 50% of the total $150 million of synergies. Given this ramp-up of the synergies over the course of the year, we project that we will deliver approximately $50 million of synergy benefits in our fiscal year 2018. As it relates to our expected $225 million of P&L cost to achieve these synergies, we expect that a bit over half of these costs will be cash-related and be incurred over the next couple of years in total. Finally, as it relates to our CH2M acquisition-related professional fees, change in control and other costs, we have realized approximately $80 million through Q1 on the P&L. So now on to the balance sheet and capital allocation strategy on Slide 16. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and debt of approximately $2.6 billion, leading to a net debt position of $1.5 billion. This net debt position after close is actually an improved position versus our original expectations. As a result, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter is 1.6x, indicative of our strong balance sheet at quarter-end, even after the recent incremental debt was put in place associated with the CH2M deal. Additionally, we continue to have $500 million of liquidity capacity on our existing revolving credit facility. So now moving to capital allocation. Our short-term cash deployment plans will be focused on paying down our current larger debt position as we continue to focus on maintaining our strong investment-grade credit profile. And we will maintain our dividend program. During the first quarter, we paid $80 million in dividends, and we recently announced that our board has declared a second quarter dividend of $0.15 per share. Finally, while we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and divestitures, our primary focus will be to reduce debt in the short term. So let me now turn the call back over to Steve for some closing thoughts. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. Finally, on Slide 17, in summary, we\u2019re executing well against our three-year strategy to maintain the culture of safety, integrity and innovation, while driving operational and financial discipline with a focus on profitable growth. Our first quarter was a solid start to fiscal year 2018, and we\u2019re optimistic that an improving macro backdrop is unfolding and we\u2019re positioned well to benefit from it. Finally, we remain confident in our previous outlook. And as a result of a lower expected tax rate, we are raising our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $3.85 to $4.25, which is up from last quarter\u2019s guidance range of $3.55 to $3.95. So operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Tahira Afzal : Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Tahira. Tahira Afzal : So I guess first question, Kevin, is for yourself. If I look at the cost savings you\u2019ve seen on an annualized basis and sort of break them down from what might have been in the first quarter, are we seeing sort of margin sort of flattish then outside of the cost savings? Any help on how to look at the underlying business and really scrub it for that would be helpful. Kevin Berryman : Yes, look, I think the margin profile associated with the synergies, there was very limited synergies in the first quarter. You might remember that we did some \u2013 took some actions at the end of the fourth quarter, our fiscal fourth quarter, which probably added $0.015 to the figures, which is embedded into that $0.77 figure. So I would say it wasn\u2019t material enough to really fundamentally change the margin profile. So I think the flattish numbers kind of remain in place as it relates to that margin profile you\u2019re alluding to. Tahira Afzal : Got it, okay. And Steve and Kevin, it seems like we\u2019re at a stage based on your bottoms-up commentary and really a backlog where we could potentially start seeing mid to high single-digit revenue growth into fiscal year 2019 or at least mid-single. To the extent we do, what is the margin profile? How much of that trickles in? Or was this \u2013 if you start to go into the high single-digit organic growth rate sort of range, do you need to make some more investments to keep that up? Steve Demetriou : Yes. Just, Tahira, I think a couple of points to your question, that we do believe that all four of our lines of business will, from a P&L standpoint, be seeing revenue growth this year versus last year, some more than others. And from a backlog standpoint, Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and even modestly on Petroleum & Chemicals, we\u2019re expecting positive backlog momentum through the rest of this year. The A&T situation will give us probably our biggest boost from a scale to be able to drive both profit growth and margin growth with these large projects that I described starting to move into execution as we get into the second half especially, third and fourth quarter. And so we do expect to see some momentum on both profit and margin growth there. But you did say it, we are seeing a strong profile, and therefore, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re hiring and training and putting in the investments to make sure that we\u2019re positioned for 2019 and beyond. But all in all, we think that there is still opportunity for margin improvement, but clearly profit growth as we go through the second half of this year. Tahira Afzal : Got it, thank you. Kevin Berryman : Let me also say, just on what Steve said, on the revenue side, there is going to be a ramp over the course of the year. And so we\u2019ll \u2013 our expectation is we go from low single digits up into the higher end of the single-digit range over the course of the balance of the year. So A&T will certainly be a part of that ramp-up in terms of revenue growth, too. Tahira Afzal : Okay, great. Congrats again guys. Kevin Berryman : Thank you. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning and nice quarter. I guess two questions. One, I was impressed with the margins within the \u2013 the margin improvement that we saw in the Petroleum & Chemicals sector. So can you talk about sort of the sustainability of those margins? And then, Steve, as you look to that market potentially improving, do you see Jacobs participating more in the OpEx cycle or big CapEx cycle within Petroleum & Chemicals moving forward? And then I guess, my second question. Kevin, you commented, I think, about the second quarter in $0.10 of sort of non-discrete items or whatever. Can you just talk about that relative \u2013 give more color around that? Are you implying that the street is too high, $0.10, just because the modeling gets a little funky with us trying to model CH2M? Hell, I just want to make sure we\u2019re not, better expectations are correct for the second quarter. Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Jamie. So on the Petroleum & Chemicals questions, we\u2019re very pleased with the focus on margin improvement. On both the year-over-year and sequential basis, the Petroleum & Chemicals team had clearly driven up the operating profit margin, which is critical to achieving our strategy. And as we get through the year, we\u2019re seeing a nice mix of everything from some selective large projects, especially overseas. We have some good things going on in the Middle East and some of the other locations, but also a good mix of sustaining capital and O&M. And so overall, that profile should allow us to continue to see year-over-year margin improvement as we get through the rest of this year and also start to see that sequential revenue growth in P&C, as they\u2019ve sort of cleaned up from the past and are now benefiting from the higher mix of backlog that they\u2019ve been winning over the last several quarters. Jamie Cook : And Steve, just to follow up on the \u2013 because obviously, there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s going to be happening in the Middle East, and you guys are well-positioned on one specific job that I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about. Can you talk about your willingness? Is this \u2013 is energy influx in particular work in the Middle East? Are you comfortable with taking on fixed price risk? Or \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to think about how you plan to participate in that market, which could potentially be higher fixed price work. Steve Demetriou : Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 we don\u2019t see a radical change unfolding in the Middle East and internationally on the projects that we\u2019re working on. So other than a couple of selective projects that we have out of our Houston office for U.S. chemical clients that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, everything that we\u2019re working on is very consistent with our risk profile. And so we\u2019re excited about some of these major projects that are involving both chemicals, some of the chemical derivatives, some large refining projects in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. And then what CH2M brings us with the water and environmental capabilities to add onto that to really put ourselves in a much stronger position to win these projects because of the wider services that we offer. All in all, Jamie, we just see well positioned with similar risk profile as we go forward. Jamie Cook : Okay, thanks. And then just, sorry, Kevin, clarification on the second quarter. Kevin Berryman : Yes, look, I think to reiterate Steve\u2019s comments, actually, we said in the past that this 80/20 split that we\u2019ve had historically and which is not too dissimilar given CH2M\u2019s portfolio, that we would effectively kind of adhere to that in general terms and that it wouldn\u2019t materially change. And as you know, the lump sum projects that we do, do are very, very strongly negotiated. So I think that\u2019s an important additional comment to make. It\u2019s not these blind bid lump sum projects, we don\u2019t go down that path, obviously. So that\u2019s just one comment. As it relates to the second quarter, look, specifically with the increase in the guidance that we have provided relative to the tax, I commented on the corporate G&A cost and that there were some kind of discrete items, the way I would characterize it, it\u2019s more of the same in Q2, which will then fall off in Q3. There are different costs that will be incurred in Q2 versus those that I outlined. And I just wanted to give you guys a heads-up that, that incremental guide on the tax benefits, we won\u2019t see some of that in the second quarter. And it was just prudent to do so, so you kind of model it correctly. Jamie Cook : Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Kevin Berryman : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Steve or Kevin, can you give us more color into the expected organic revenue growth at CH2 for 2018? You mentioned that last quarter, it was down a little as oil and gas was a drag, but it was up an underlying 2% in calendar year 2017. And you\u2019ve previously given us buckets of growth for CH2, water and environment expect to grow 4% to 5%; nuclear start to grow 2% to 3%. So as you close the deal, do you see any of these CH2 businesses going slower or faster than what you originally thought in 2018? Steve Demetriou : Yes. So maybe starting with CH2M because I think you\u2019re asking for both what we\u2019ve acquired but as well as the underlying Jacobs organic growth. But the strength that we have with the timing of CH2M is their state and local business, which is going to be predominantly integrated with our Buildings & Infrastructure to create this new BIF line of business. The backlog was up 18% in 2017 versus 2016. So that bodes well for now starting to see the P&L revenue and profit growth from that backlog start to get executed in 2018. And the national sector, which is going to be, for the most part, integrated with our Aerospace & Technology, was up 11%. The one soft spot was the private sector, but the benefit of putting their private sector now together with, especially the oil and gas side of it, with our Petroleum & Chemicals is really going to be the revenue synergies drive to win new business with the environmental and water capabilities we now bring to the Jacobs\u2019 much larger platform of Petroleum & Chemicals. The timing of that revenue organic growth into the P&L will probably lag a couple of quarters as we went and start to execute those businesses. But we feel very positive about the timing of the backlog growth and now starting to see that impact the P&L in 2018 for Jacobs on the CH2M side. Does that answer your question, Andrew? Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, I think it does. Actually, I was mostly asking about CH2. So let me ask you about CH2 in terms of free cash flow and your expectation there going forward. And then related to that, you\u2019ve mentioned that Jacobs\u2019 net debt post the deal close was $1.5 billion. I think you had suggested net debt would be closer to $1.9 billion. So did CH2 come over with more cash? Was it your higher stock price that helped you in closing the deal? Like maybe you could just talk about the particulars there? Kevin Berryman : No, we did have a little bit more cash than we had expected, Andrew, is the short answer to the question. And effectively, that translated into that $1.5 billion net debt. So we\u2019re \u2013 the good news is we\u2019re starting from a strong perspective as it relates to that. So look, it doesn\u2019t change our philosophy on how we go forward to delever. We think that\u2019s an appropriate thing to do, where we\u2019re really committed to this very strong position of being a good solid investment, strong investment-grade rating. Even though we don\u2019t have public debt, we philosophically want to have very strong investment grade kind of metrics, and so we\u2019re committed to that. So I think that bodes well. I would say, just additional comments maybe on Steve\u2019s comments on the growth. We certainly like the growth outlook in state and local for sure, I think, as well on the federal side, and then there could be some potential pressure on the side of private. So I think fundamentally, the things that we called out in terms of growth profile is where we think the growth can come from in CH2M. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Kevin, how do we look at the free cash flow profile of CH2 here coming in over the next year or so? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, we think that there is an opportunity to improve the cash flow profile. They have higher levels of DSOs, and we also think there\u2019s an ability, and that will happen through synergies and focusing on possible business, which they\u2019ve already started to do. The legacy CH2M team had really started that journey already. So I think there\u2019s an opportunity for the operational cash flows of CH2M to improve over time. It doesn\u2019t happen immediately. We\u2019ve talked about us being able to get to a conversion number of at least one longer term, and that will be muddied in the short-term because of our costs to try and get the synergies and all that kind of stuff. But we do fundamentally believe there\u2019s opportunities to improve it longer term. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, guys. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Your line is open. Andrew Wittmann : Great. Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to get some perspectives from you guys now that you\u2019ve closed on CH2M. Before the deal closed, there\u2019s a public filing where CH2M laid out kind of their view of their multiyear growth period. With your ownership of that now, how do you feel about that projection that they had out, recognizing that the 2017 number came in a little bit light of what the company has expected at the time? Steve Demetriou : So let me start and, Kevin, maybe build on it. 2017 ended up almost spot on to what we had modeled and therefore had used for our projections that we gave with regard to EPS accretion, et cetera. So we\u2019re pleased with the final 2017 number. We feel confident in our 2018 financials as well. As I mentioned, the backlog, very high backlog. So as far as what we need to grow and achieve our overall guidance that we just gave, we feel very confident in both the CH2M and Jacobs underlying outlook as well as some of the other benefits we\u2019ve talked about. And then we got super excited about 2019 and beyond because by that time, we\u2019ll have had the time to really leverage the revenue synergies that we\u2019ve been talking about. Obviously, in the early days, we\u2019re very heavily focused on delivering $150 million of cost synergies we\u2019ve talked about. But we\u2019re not \u2013 as the teams have now come together, there\u2019s a lot of excitement about what we can do in 2019 and beyond. Just as a couple of examples that we\u2019ve come to learn over the last couple of months. Bob Pragada, our President of the new BIF, was out in Asia Pacific and Middle East and India. And the things that he and the combined teams have been talking about are smart city work in India, that CH2M brings a much higher level than we were doing in our infrastructure side where we\u2019ve been heavily focused on Petroleum & Chemicals in India. They bring the Buildings & Infrastructure innovation side, putting those two together will be powerful. Singapore, deep relationships that the CH2M folks have with the government there, especially in utilities, transportation is combining now with our capabilities. And then the iconic programs that we\u2019ve talked about several times really showed in some of the Middle East activities they have working on Dubai Expo 2020 and the Qatar World Cup 2022, and now being able to put these capabilities together, and I just gave you just a small sampling of what excites us that\u2019s going to cut across all three of our new lines of business as it relates to growth. We remain as bullish as we were when we announced the deal and when we closed the deal. Kevin Berryman : So Andrew, just I guess relative to the CH2M model that was included in the S-4, look, that model was a robust model, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. That doesn\u2019t mean that we didn\u2019t have our own view of very strong financial performance, which was incorporated into our valuation of the deal. So maybe I\u2019ll leave it at that. And we\u2019re excited about how they finished in 2017 and how they were looking to drive the performance in 2018. Andrew Wittmann : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Jon, Kevin, Steve. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Steve, in your early remarks, talked about improved backlog margin 2017 versus 2016, and there\u2019s pretty impressive numbers. Could you maybe just explain a little bit on, is it more mix-driven? Is it more demand for your services is improving so you can generate better profit and negotiated margins? Or is it you\u2019ve been more disciplined in like chasing a certain project that the bid list get too high that you\u2019re now putting the time and effort in and be more focused on those margins? And to follow on that, looking at the projects you completed in 2017 versus 2016, how that conversion from the as-sold margin for the backlog to what you guys reported, how that trend\u2019s been? Steve Demetriou : Okay, thank you, Mike. And from time to time, we apologize for the sirens in the background. We\u2019re doing this call from our New York City office in Penn Station, and it gets a little loud out there. And so we hope it\u2019s minimal. But Mike, the answer is really all of the above. And you really laid it out very nicely because it is a combination of all three of those factors that you talked about. The biggest one, really going back to a few years ago when we launched our new strategy, and we talked about a more disciplined approach, but also a much stronger capability of understanding where we make our money, where we don\u2019t, which offices are driving the higher profitability. And just \u2013 and also really understanding ultimately as we are now going out and bidding and winning business, how we\u2019re going to upfront integrate that with operations on a much more seamless way that preserve the as-sold margin all the way to the end of the project. But equal to that and pretty impressive has been the added innovation that we\u2019re now bringing in the extended services. This whole Jacobs Connected Enterprise is a major contributor led by Aerospace & Technology. And when you look at what Terry Hagen and the team have won over the last 1.5 years, we\u2019re getting into \u2013 we\u2019re shifting away from these rebid projects that we had about a couple of years ago that were good solid margins but lower margins, to these impressive projects that we are bringing in more IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, additional elements that we weren\u2019t having in several years ago. And some of these are large projects, some of these are smaller niche projects, but clearly contributing to the type of margin growth. So it really is a combination of commercial excellence, project execution and just a much sharper understanding of the financial and business acumen around selling and delivering projects. Kevin, anything to add on the as-sold margin piece of Mike\u2019s question? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Mike, look, I think everything Steve said reiterate obviously. The second point is the project execution has dramatically improved over the course of the last three years. If you look at what we call write-downs, which is basically we give away $50,000 here, $100,000 there, $200,000 here, maybe a $1 million or $2 million now and again, those numbers have dramatically been reduced over the period 2015 to 2017. So gross margin improvement has been driven, to some extent, by that. But actually, those write-downs are down 50% versus the number of 2015. So it is all of the things Steve talked about and really this whole fundamental getting back to project execution, doing good work for our clients, being transparent, not surprising them and executing in a manner that allows us to protect more of that gross margin. Michael Dudas : Thanks. And Steve, don\u2019t worry about the sirens. There are a lot more sirens going on a Monday at Wall Street, so we\u2019re cool. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Hi, good morning, everyone. You folks spoke about the infrastructure market in your prepared remarks as, it looks like, as the strongest end market outlook. Can you just expand on what you\u2019re seeing from a feasibility study standpoint, where do you see the strongest momentum by region? And what\u2019s your sense on the addressable pipeline of opportunities for you folks to get awards from this end market in fiscal 2018? And how does that compare to last year? Steve Demetriou : Yes, from a Jacobs-only side, if we start there, clearly, the transportation, it really does come down to that big three that I talked about earlier, Jerry, is airports especially, just a tremendous amount of opportunities globally on airport opportunities. And we\u2019ve been winning, I would say, more than our fair share compared \u2013 the last couple of years compared to the past. And we\u2019re in the mix of some very major projects around the world. And so the whole global \u2013 globalization of that by our Buildings & Infrastructure team to be able to bring the best resources and win projects locally has just been impressive. But big highway jobs in the U.S., transit in Australia, some big waste treatment facilities especially in the U.S. are some examples there. The resiliency drive that I talked about really over the last couple of years, a tremendous focus and improvement at Jacobs in them being able to bring sustainable solutions, capitalizing on climate change and the things that our clients need. And then on the buildings side, health care, especially outside of the U.S., some big health care opportunities in Singapore and U.K. and really around the world, mission-critical on our buildings\u2019 data centers. We\u2019re in the mix of some data centers in Asia Pacific and India. And overall, when we look at our pipeline globally, it\u2019s up 20% year-over-year, the underlying pipeline of opportunity, and that\u2019s why I mentioned we\u2019re sort of flushed with opportunities. Obviously, we got to go out and win those. And so, Jerry, it really is across both the Buildings & Infrastructure platform. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m positive about now the timing of CH2M coming into the company because they would be saying the same thing if they were a standalone company of the state and local business up 18% and water being critical, environmental solutions needed by all of industries around the world. And we\u2019ve put that together with Jacobs, and we\u2019re really excited about the opportunities going forward. Jerry Revich : And Steve, what we\u2019ve seen for a number of companies in the U.S. infrastructure value chain, if you will, a relatively disappointing 2017, and considering how much visibility you folks have on the feasibility study side, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the cadence of the opportunity set in the U.S. specifically as well. So you mentioned, globally, the pipeline is up 20%. What\u2019s your read on data center pickup in the U.S. markets specifically based on what you folks are seeing? Steve Demetriou : Everything I said, we included the U.S. We\u2019re seeing the budgets improving in the U.S., especially on the state and local side. There was some data that came out yesterday from one of the sources that U.S. transportation funding in 2017 was up, I think, it was 6% or 7% versus prior year. And all the discussions we\u2019re having with clients, there continues to be that sort of more bullishness. Obviously, waiting to see what happens with the federal side and when and if our U.S. government is going to get together on both sides of the aisle and get this thing across the finish line. There\u2019s just a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of projects that are not only in the pipeline but appear to have the funding to move to the field, and we\u2019re in the mix on these things. So Jerry, I think it\u2019s consistent in the U.S. of what I said. Jerry Revich : Okay. I appreciate the color. And then separately, Kevin, you folks had a really strong 2017 in terms of improvement in line of business margins really across the portfolio. As you think about what\u2019s in the backlog over the next 9 months to 12 months, can you talk about where do you see room for the margin improvement momentum to continue by line of business versus where should we be thinking about products or projects in various stages of completion that might have a different margin profile as we head through fiscal 2018? Kevin Berryman : So Jerry, I think the overall picture is really, and part of the strategy that we put in place back in late 2016 calendar year, is really each of the line of business is focusing on trying to improve their profitability. And that strategy remains. So consequently, it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to invest in our businesses to ensure that, that growth is there. But we would expect that we would continue to have some ability to improve our margins longer term. Having said all of that, I do think the one kind of call-out, which could be a little bit different in 2018 specifically is Aerospace & Technology because of their very large enterprise contracts that they\u2019ve won. A good margin business, but they\u2019re not necessarily a higher-margin business. So as that kind of flows through, through 2018, as A&T ramps up, I would say that they\u2019ll stay in that 8% to 9% range, but may not see some fundamental improvements in operating profit margin. But each of the other organizations are looking to try and drive continued improvement. It won\u2019t all come at once. There will be a journey along that path. But ultimately, our expectations is the teams will continue to drive towards that. Jerry Revich : Yes, I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi, good morning, everyone. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Chad Dillard : Can you provide an update on what you\u2019re seeing in your UK defense? How big of a contributor is it to A&T? And has this customer indicated any change in spending? Kevin Berryman : Could you just repeat the question one more time? It wasn\u2019t coming through as clearly as the others. Chad Dillard : Sure. Yes. So can you provide an update on what you\u2019re seeing in your UK defense? How big of a contributor is it to A&T? And has the customer indicated any change in spending? Kevin Berryman : So look, if you look at our A&T business, it is largely a U.S.-driven business because of the large federal presence that we have in the various parts of the U.S. government, whether it\u2019s DoD, whether it\u2019s the intelligence communities, whether it\u2019s NASA, all of these initiatives, plus the DOE with environmental spend of the historical Jacobs. And now, especially with the new business coming at CH2M, it\u2019s even more U.S.-focused. So if you look at those numbers, I don\u2019t know with CH2M what the percentage is of A&T, but it is driven primarily by the U.S., and I would say it\u2019s probably at least 80% of the business relative to that. Well, don\u2019t hold me to that number, but effectively, it\u2019s a big chunk, especially more so now with CH2M coming into the picture. Steve Demetriou : Let me just add to that, Kevin. So we do work on some projects and programs for the Ministry of Defence. And I would say, overall, our outlook is stable from 2017 to 2018. Not as robust as the U.S., but still, I would say on a very stable front. Chad Dillard : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then since the signing of tax reform, have you seen a pickup in engagement with corporates expressing interest to deploy their tax savings on more infrastructure since the year started? Just trying to get a sense for whether we\u2019re actually starting to see actions come through in RFPs or just greater engagement rather than just companies signaling on spending more. Steve Demetriou : Yes, there\u2019s discussion, but I would say at this stage, sitting here, it\u2019s still very early. I think everyone\u2019s still trying to figure out their tax situation. And just like us, just in the last few weeks, we\u2019ve come to a really better understanding. So that\u2019s going to pick up, but let me just comment on that, that our hope is that certain industries, like the life science industry, that they\u2019ll use that benefit of being able to repatriate funds and use that to grow infrastructure and grow assets and expand in the U.S. rather than using it all to buy back stock. And if it\u2019s the former, then we\u2019re going to benefit. I think the industry consolidation is going to heat up as these companies get more sort of confident in investing. And we play a big part in industry consolidation with regard to the studies, master planning, but also helping facilitate the integration and facilities optimization, et cetera. So there\u2019s a lot refining. I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing a lot \u2013 we\u2019re hearing a lot of discussion in the U.S. But with regard to RFPs and real projects unfolding, I think we\u2019re a few quarters away from really understanding how that\u2019s going to unfold. Chad Dillard : Got it. Thanks guys. Kevin Berryman : So Denise, I think we probably, given the schedule here, we\u2019re going to need to cut the questions off at this particular point in time. But I would like to add one comment to those on the call. Just a note to advise everyone that Terry Hagen, our President of our Aerospace, Technology, Environment and Nuclear business, is going to be presenting at the Cowen conference tomorrow at the Lotte. And Steve was originally going to be presenting but has a conflict now, so I\u2019ll be joining Terry to talk about some of the specific and unique things that we do on our Aerospace & Technology business for the defense and aerospace industry. So excited about delivering some of the news there as it relates to the strengths and capabilities of our team. So just wanted to throw that out to the team. Steve Demetriou : All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I\u2019d like to end by saying we\u2019re excited and positive about the road ahead for Jacobs, but be perfectly clear that our top priority is the successful integration of CH2M, and we look forward to keeping you updated. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Please now turn to slide 3 for a review of the agenda for today's call. I would like to note a few items in regards to our presentation and remarks today. Our results reported today included a review by our three updated lines of business. For comparative purposes, we had disclosed revenue and operating income for this updated structure reflecting the current quarter and accordingly, the same quarter a year ago. We plan to provide historical segment level data on a rolling quarter basis. During the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current quarter results to Jacobs and CH2M's performance in 2017 calculated on a pro-forma basis. The 2017 pro forma figures are adjusted to exclude restructuring and other related charges, the deconsolidation of CH2M's Chalk River joint venture and CH2M's MoPac project. We believe this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business in comparing current performance against prior periods. Turning to the agenda, Steve will begin with a discussion of our core values, provide a recap of our second quarter results including a market review of each line of business and provide an update on our CH2M integration. Kevin will then provide some in-depth discussion on our financial metrics as well as review our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. Steve will then provide our outlook for the fiscal year along with some closing remarks, and we'll open the call for questions. With that, I will now pass it over to our chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Welcome to our fiscal year 2018 second quarter earnings call. Before we review our quarterly results by each of our new lines of business, I'd like to briefly discuss some key topics that align with our core values at Jacobs. This week, two very important industry-wide initiatives are taking place, which we're actively involved : Safety Week where Jacobs and approximately 60 other firms globally sponsor initiatives to raise safety awareness. Actually, at Jacobs, every day and all year, we persistently drive safety excellence with our best-in-class BeyondZero framework, which enables us to consistently achieve industry-leading performance. This week, we're also observing Drinking Water Week and are pleased to build on our commitment to improve water resources around the world, delivering the industry's most highly commended innovations gained with our recent CH2M acquisition. And to further differentiate Jacobs, we've extended our culture of caring in mental well-being and sustainability with our Plan Beyond strategy and in steps we're taking to lead our industry and diversity. We're building on an innovative inclusive culture to make Jacobs the employer of choice everywhere we compete. We are putting muscle behind these efforts to provide our clients big brain thinking, the kind that happens when scientists, engineers, biologists, architects, builders, and technologists tackle problems together. With the Jacobs-CH2M combination, we've grown to approximately 77,000 employees, and our commitment to our core values and employee culture positions Jacobs to attract the best and brightest. At Jacobs, we understand that a great culture makes a great company, and we're on a mission to create a new kind of professional services company, one that is like no other in the world today. Turning to slide 5, we're on track to deliver strong fiscal year 2018 results, reflecting the fact that we're executing well on our major strategic priorities to build a winning culture, to drive increased margins across all lines of business with differentiated client-centric solutions, and to profitably grow by focusing resources on higher-margin opportunities and executing our work with excellence. And with regard to the recent CH2M acquisition, our commitments are deliver targeted cost synergies and drive profitable revenue growth synergies and to accelerate deleveraging in this second half of fiscal 2018. We continue to benefit from strong end market demand across our Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear line of business and our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities business along with improving fundamentals in our Energy Chemicals and Resources sector. Revenue on a pro forma basis grew 16% versus the prior year. Notably, we saw the strong pro forma revenue growth across all lines of business. We continued to deliver on our strategy to drive improved project execution and benefited from the higher gross margin mix from the CH2M acquisition, now with total gross margin in the second quarter at 19.7%, up 140 basis points from last year's second quarter reported margin. As a result, I'm very pleased with our second quarter adjusted earnings of $1 per share, an increase of 28% year-over-year, which included an expected $0.09 charge for a legal matter. Kevin will cover the components of EPS including a bridge to GAAP EPS in his remarks. Second quarter backlog increased sequentially to $26.5 billion and is up 9% on a pro forma basis from last year's second quarter, with all three of our lines of business contributing to the pro forma backlog growth. It is also important to note that our second quarter backlog excludes the impact of approximately $400 million of previous awards that remained under protest at the end of the second quarter. Our second quarter is clear evidence that our transformative acquisition of CH2M is off to a great start. We're creating a lot of excitement with our clients with our new combined offerings, and the culture integration is surpassing my expectations, and cost synergies are on track in gaining momentum. Turning to slide 6, as I just noted, our second quarter revenue and backlog was strong at over $26.5 billion, a 9% year-over-year pro forma growth. Higher margin professional services backlog grew 10 % on a pro forma basis. From a line of business perspective, ATEN backlog on a pro forma basis was up 19% year-over-year, and BIAF backlog increased by 7%. We also experienced modest growth in our ECR business, which was up 2% year-over-year as commodity-driven end markets contributed to stabilize our business and are showing signs of recovery. More importantly, overall gross margin and our backlog is now up 100 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, demonstrating the higher margin mix from the CH2M acquisition. Turning to slide 7, let me discuss the performance by our line of business beginning with Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear, our ATEN business. We had a very strong quarter in ATEN as revenue grew 16% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, and operating profit was up more than 30%, excluding a onetime legal matter. With this growth trajectory, our ATEN line of business is on track to generate approximately $4.5 billion of revenue in calendar 2018, making it one of the largest government service providers in the industry. In Q2, ATEN posted strong backlog growth, up 19% versus last year's combined second quarter backlog with both legacy Jacobs and CH2M contributing to the growth. I'm also pleased that the gross margin in the ATEN backlog increased year-over-year. There remains approximately $400 million of previous awards under protest, which we expect will be successfully cleared and added to our backlog by early fiscal year 2019. This strong overall growth more than offsets the approximate $100 million per quarter burn-off associated with the previously noted confidential contract that is up for renewal later in 2019. We continue to feel confident in this rebid renewal opportunity. Strategically, our ATEN business is benefiting from two dynamics : an acceleration in end-market demand and strong internal execution that is resulting in organic market share gains. From an end market standpoint, we continue to benefit from key national government spending priorities such as the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and NASA that are seeing funding plus-ups. Within our commercial markets, we're also benefiting from an investment cycle in areas such as the 5G wireless build-out and high-tech areas of commercial automotive. Our organic market share gains are driven by a unique value proposition that combines strong technical expertise, a unique localized delivery model, and an industry-leading efficient cost structure. While on the surface this model seems intuitive, it is proven difficult by others to replicate. Looking forward, we're focused on driving continued market share gains and capturing adjacent opportunities in targeted areas of IT development, cybersecurity and operations, weapon system life cycle, and other areas. We're also focused on revenue synergy opportunities with a major emphasis on Tier 1 nuclear opportunities through our combination with CH2M. In many instances, these Tier 1 nuclear opportunities are highly selective multiyear government contracts worth billions of dollars. We recently commenced work on the management and operations contract with the Department of Energy at the Nevada National Security Site, an example of one of these multiyear contracts. Also last week, we were awarded an additional IDIQ contract with Special Operations Forces Information Technology Enterprise, SITEC, for $110 million over five years, which will be on top of the $778 million award that cleared protest in January. These new task orders are expected to be similar to the scope of our work with SITEC for IT and cyber support, providing comprehensive services worldwide for U.S. Special Operations Command. In summary, the ATEN business has built a solid foundation by executing against a focused strategy, and we're excited about key CH2M capabilities, which together position us well to deliver double-digit year-over-year profit growth in fiscal 2018. Now on to slide 8 to discuss our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities line of business, BIAF, which posted strong second quarter results. BIAF revenue increased 15% on a pro forma basis versus last year's second quarter and delivered a significant increase in operating profit. Additionally, revenue and backlog was up 7% versus last year with gross margin and backlog up nicely year-over-year. From a macro perspective, we're seeing strong demand in U.S. infrastructure, fueled by the recent omnibus spending bill and continued strength in state and local funding, which led to a double-digit growth in our pipeline of opportunities. The UK transportation market remains healthy despite Brexit, and across the Middle East and Asia, we're seeing accelerated demand. Around the world, we're seeing strong demand for the big three infrastructure priorities : water, transportation, and resilience. And we are very well positioned to benefit from this. We also believe the U.S. is in the early stages of a significant water infrastructure investment cycle. A recent EPA survey cited $473 billion of infrastructure needs over the next 20 years to improve U.S. drinking water. Our strong project pipeline in water aligns with an improving investment cycle. For example, we recently won a design-build wastewater project with the City of San Jose, California, and we have water opportunities in our sales pipeline for the next 12 months. Transportation also continues to show strong global demand. Within aviation, robust air passenger growth and overall economic expansion are driving investments in airports globally. We're leaders in airfield design and program management for some of the world's busiest airports and largest expansion programs. So, we expect to capitalize further on these opportunities. From a rail and highway standpoint, increased urbanization is driving solid demand worldwide. For example, we're a key partner to Highways England for design services as this client is entering a period of increasing spend. Additionally, we were recently awarded incremental scope with California High-Speed Rail and with the Network Rail in the UK. With regard to our built environment business, we're witnessing an increase in Smart City initiatives among Tier 2 cities. This is an area of strength for Jacobs as we combine innovative digital intelligent solutions for buildings with our deep relationships with local governments around the world. As an example, Jacobs was selected as the program manager overseeing the development of new greenfield industrial smart cities in India and Australia. And our Advanced Facilities business performed better than expected during the quarter driven by life sciences strength and semiconductor plant new builds. In life sciences, technology advances as well as reform tax legislation is driving potential U.S. investment. We're also seeing continued investments in Europe such as our recent win where we secured a construction management contract with a new biotech client in Switzerland and a contract in Ireland for a large-scale cell culture facility. Consumer electronics, cloud computing capacity, vehicle automation, and edge computing are driving increased investment in the electronics market. So, in summary, the BIAF business is making significant progress on our strategic plan and poised well for continued growth. From an integration standpoint, we're starting to see the velocity of the combined Jacobs and CH2M infrastructure business manifest as the teams are working together in lockstep, and large profitable revenue synergy opportunities are entering the pipeline. And now to our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business on slide 9. In the second quarter, our revenue in ECR increased significantly, up 17% on a pro-forma basis, and bottom line performance was strong with both operating profit and operating margin increasing significantly. And while I'm very pleased that on a pro-forma basis, ECR revenue and backlog grew by 2%, more importantly, the gross margin in backlog increased more than 100 basis points, demonstrating strong execution against our strategy to focus on pursuing and winning high-value business. I want to reiterate that our strategy in the ECR line of business will continue to focus on highly recurring lower-risk segments of the energy, chemicals and mining value chain with a high percentage of our revenue aligned to our clients' OpEx spend. This proved to be successful during the recent downturn as our ECR backlog weathered the weak energy and commodity markets better than our peers with a weighted average backlog decline in the low-single digits compared to the rest of the industry, which witnessed a much deeper decline in the 2014 to 2017 downturn. We're definitely now seeing signs of improvement across this business, but we will maintain the discipline to prioritize this low-risk, highly recurring revenue with a relentless focus on driving margin improvement and superior project execution excellence. The refining segment is providing opportunities globally as many large clients are beginning to move forward with initiatives to increase capacity utilization and expand logistics infrastructure. Specifically, we're seeing several opportunities across Asia, India, the Middle East, and the Latin America as the industry drives to expand refining capacity and make local regulatory requirements. MARPOL 2020 regulations require that shipping vessels reduce their sulfur emissions. To comply, we expect shippers to shift higher-grade fuel, which will require refiners to invest in upgrades. We're well positioned to benefit from this. Also in the downstream sector, we're involved in several opportunities for crude oil to chemicals across the Middle East and Asia. And as the second wave of U.S. ethane cracker projects move forward with six U.S. crackers planned, we expect to benefit from derivative chemicals both domestically and across the globe. In our mining, minerals and technology business, mining studies and early engineering work are up significantly year-over-year as supply is tightening, mainly driven by copper and iron ore, a great leading indicator that we will continue to see growth in this market as well. From a CH2M cross-selling standpoint, we're starting to build a robust pipeline of global opportunities for industrial water solutions. We've already secured work on multiple opportunities with our hydrocarbon and mining clients including a large steam upgrade project with an energy major. We are now working on converting several FEED opportunities to EPC or EPCM solution. On slide 10, again, I'm very pleased to report the integration of CH2M is going well. We have fully implemented the new organizational structure worldwide. As we have previously stated, a key metric for us is closely monitoring talent retention. Overall, global attrition levels are stable, and importantly, we're retaining CH2M employees at a higher rate with voluntary attrition levels in the lines of businesses below pre-acquisition levels. In fact, since the acquisition, we've actually increased net head count by 3,000, which is a testament to our growth trajectory. I'm very pleased that all major cost synergy work streams are on track to achieve targets, and Kevin will provide more detail associated with our cost synergy initiative and deal targets. As I stated earlier, we're beginning to see profitable revenue synergies being identified across the organization with large opportunities entering the 2019 pipeline. So, in summary, the industrial logic for this acquisition was predicated on creating a better combined company that does not exist in the world today. The impact of our combined scale is clearly being felt throughout the industry. Jacobs is now ranked the largest design firm by revenue according to the Engineering News-Record. I'll turn the call now over to Kevin. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. And moving to slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the second quarter of our fiscal 2018 year. Again, during my remarks today, I will sometimes discuss comparisons of current quarter results to Jacobs and CH2M's performance in 2017 calculated on a pro forma basis. We believe this information will help provide additional insight in the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against those prior periods. So, second quarter pro forma year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 16% from our pro forma year-over-year growth of 2% in the first quarter. This improvement of growth is consistent with our prior messaging that the fiscal 2017-2018 period would, in fact, be the inflection point to strong organic growth as our strategy gained traction. Organic revenue growth was broad-based with an increase of 19% and 10% year-over-year for both Jacobs and CH2M's legacy businesses, respectively. Gross margins were 19.7%, up 140 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and 200 basis points sequentially. Regarding G&A, we realized good growth leverage on our G&A spend as pro forma G&A as a percentage of revenue fell 110 basis points in the current quarter versus the year-ago pro forma figure. Please note that this comparison adjusts for the legal matter in Q2, incremental CH2M acquisition-related depreciation and amortization, and the discrete benefit of the India Welfare Trust restructuring in the year-ago figure. While GAAP operating profit margin was 3.7% due to CH2M-related acquisition and integration costs, our adjusted operating profit margin was 5.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.34, down year-over-year. CH2M acquisition-related restructuring charges to achieve synergies, professional fees, and other transaction-related expenses including change in control costs impacted EPS by $0.38. Additionally, a charge resulting from the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the U.S. tax reform impacted EPS by $0.28. When excluding these costs, our adjusted EPS was $1, which is up 28% versus the year-ago figure, with a $0.09 headwind from a legal matter included in that $1 figure. With this performance, we remain confident that we will deliver against that EPS accretion targets that we outlined for the CH2M acquisition at the time we announced the transaction last August. Turning to our bookings during the quarter, our adjusted pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 time for trailing 12-month period and for the second quarter period, respectively. Flipping to slide 12, let's look at the sequential trends in revenue and gross margin in more detail. As we have previously stated, we are focused on disciplined project execution, reducing write-downs, and targeting higher margin opportunities throughout the cycles in our end markets. In Q2, our gross margin reached 19%, as earlier stated. The strong performance is due to a combination of solid project execution, improvement in Jacobs' gross margin, and a higher value CH2M gross profit mix. Turning to slide 13, please note that I will cover both historical performance and additional guidance into our expectations for second half growth and profitability by our updated lines of businesses. We trust this will provide additional insight and support regarding the outlook for our revised segment reporting structure. So, let's begin with ATEN. Revenue on a pro forma basis grew 16% year-over-year with growth being most pronounced in the Jacobs legacy portfolio with approximately 22% organic growth. Looking forward, we expect mid-single sequential growth off of our Q2 numbers, resulting in double-digit year-over-year pro forma growth as we continue to ramp newly awarded contracts. While operating margin percentage for the quarter was down year-over-year, there was 160-basis-point impact from the legal matter in the current second quarter results. Excluding the impact of this item, our adjusted operating margin was 7.1% above the year-ago pro forma figure. We expect ATEN margins in the second half of fiscal 2018 in the 7% to 8% range with the ability to further expand above 8% longer term. BIAF revenue grew 15% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, driven by strong growth in the Americas, Middle East, and Asia Pacific. Operating margin of 7.8% was up 80 basis points from the year-ago quarter and 40 basis points on a pro forma basis. While we expect our pro forma revenue growth to continue to be solid over the balance of the year, we do not expect the year-over-year growth to continue at this robust of a level in the second half of the year. As for margin, BIAF margins are expected to be in the 8% to 9% range in the second half of fiscal 2018. We see room for margin expansion in BIAF as we continue to drive strong project delivery metrics and benefit from the scale of the combined businesses. Lastly, our ECR business also grew 17% year-over-year on a pro forma basis as growth was driven by construction, maintenance, and turnaround projects as well as a pickup in front-end mining studies. The year-over-year growth was driven by the Jacobs legacy portfolio. Operating margin ticked up slightly to 5.3% even though the Jacobs' year-ago margin included the benefit of the restructuring of the India Welfare Trust, which added 110 basis points to Jacobs' ECR margins a year ago. Excluding that benefit in the year-ago figures, operating margins were actually up 120 basis points on an underlying basis from the pro forma year-ago period. So, before turning to the next slide and while not highlighted on the slide, our non-allocated corporate overhead increased to $36 million but was in line with our expectations and down from our pro forma figure of $44 million in Q1. For the second half of the year, we expect unallocated corporate overhead to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million per quarter excluding large discrete items. Overall, we are pleased with the strong Q2 financial performance across each line of business as revenue grew in the mid-teens on a pro forma basis for each with all realizing continued strong underlying improvements in profitability. Turning to slide 14, now let me provide an update on our restructuring and acquisition-related costs. We certainly remain on track to achieve $150 million of targeted net cost synergies we outlined with an estimated cost to achieve of $225 million, and we have realized $15 million in net synergies in Q2. Through Q2, we have incurred approximately $106 million of the $225 million in cost to achieve these synergies. These initial costs are largely labor and real estate related. Approximately two-thirds of these costs have been cash related. As of the end of Q2, we have achieved a run rate of approximately one-third of the expected synergies of $150 million. We expect to achieve a run rate savings of over 50% of the total $150 million of synergies by the end of our fiscal year. As a result, we are confident we will deliver $50 million in net synergy benefits in our fiscal year 2018. In fact, we actually believe there is potential upside to our synergy estimates although we are also considering additional investments that could mitigate the bottom line impact of these incremental synergies. Regardless, to reiterate, we are confident that we will deliver at least the net $50 million of cost synergies in 2018 and the net $150 million of run rate synergies by the end of our fiscal 2019. As it relates to our expected $225 million in P&L cost to achieve these synergies, we continue to expect that a bit over half of these costs will be cash related and be incurred over the next couple of years. Finally, as it relates to our CH2M transaction and change in control costs, we have incurred approximately $85 million through Q2. We are largely completed with these discrete onetime costs. Before we move to the balance sheet, let me provide an update on Impex (00:31:06) matter, also referenced as the Icathus (00:31:09) matter. There is no change in our expectations relative to when we conducted our original due diligence on the project as part of the acquisition of CH2M. We continue to be very early in this process, and we expect that any potential resolution of this matter will be approached well into the future. So, let's turn to slide 15 and now on to the balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter with cash of $800 million and a gross debt of approximately $2.5 billion. Our gross debt level is down modestly from our Q1 level. Additionally, we have previously announced a $500 million private placement, which we expect to fund this month, with the proceeds to be used to pay down a portion of our revolving credit facility. In line with our previous commitments, we will continue to use cash to pay down our planned larger debt position as we focus on maintaining our strong investment grade credit profile. Regardless, our gross debt leverage fell to 2.2 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 versus the 2.5 times at the end of Q1 as calculated per the terms of our credit agreements. We are also maintaining our dividend program. During the second quarter, we paid $21 million in dividends, and we recently announced that our board has declared a third quarter dividend of $0.15 per share. As we deleverage to our target net debt ratios near the end of our fiscal year-end, we will again have degrees of freedom to consider additional growth opportunities, reinitiate our return of cash to our shareholders via stock repurchases, and continue our dividend program. Now, let me turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our second quarter performance across all of our lines of business and the progress of our integration of CH2M. As such, we're raising our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $4 to $4.40, which is up from last quarter's guidance of $3.85 to $4.25. So, operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning and nice quarter. I guess, my first question, I was impressed with the gross margins this quarter, understanding that CH2M was accretive and helped the gross margin. I'm just trying to think about the sustainability of the gross margins in that level and was there anything unusual in there. And in that context, it's hard to not think there's upside to the back half of your year if there's nothing unusual in these gross margin numbers. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: No. No real fundamental. There's always puts and takes in the quarter, Jamie, but we feel good about the gross margin figure. And we think that these levels are sustainable, and you know that that's really fundamentally part of our strategy is to really go after work that we believe has the right risk profile, with appropriate and improving margin profiles. So, aligned with our strategy longer term, that's certainly what we're looking to do in terms of driving the gross margin profile. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then I guess my second question, you sort of alluded to potential upside opportunity on the CH2M savings. And you obviously said you might reinvest some of that business. But can you just sort of give us some color in terms of where you're ahead of schedule relative to what you would have thought and sort of what could be the degree of upside surprise and then where we would reinvest? Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yes. Look, I think the over-performance are potentially as we continued to peel away the onion relative to the duplication of resources throughout the organization, that certainly has implications for potential labor improvements, but it's not just there. We're continuing to aggressively go after real estate, and that real estate can sometimes be tricky because it takes a while to move people and relocate offices and so on and so forth. So, real estate is really an opportunity as well. The final piece is a little bit more longer term, and it's really related to our system configurations and getting together in a combined organization. I think that those three things are all offering upside to the potential opportunity. I will say that as we think about combining our two companies \u2013 and maybe Steve might want to make some comments as well \u2013 we really are looking to become an employer of choice. And as we're thinking about the consolidation of our benefit programs and so on and so forth, there may be some investment back into the business from that perspective. And the other point is we will continue to invest in our system environment, and there can be some upfront P&L investments as it relates to that as well. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Kevin, I think you summarized it well. Jamie, I think what you'll see with us is as we progress through this year and into next year, the most important thing is as we claim synergies that we'll all be able to see them hitting the bottom line. And so, that's the rigor we're providing, and we'll just keep everybody updated on a quarterly basis how that's creating value. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi and congrats in the quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thanks, Tahira. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Steve, if you look out, I know you're talking more and more about water. I know it's still early months, but can you kind of frame maybe the scope and size of what you're seeing in context of perhaps what you're seeing in some of your other businesses? In terms of revenue synergies, is this the area with the most opportunities or would you point to one of the other segments? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, there's a handful of things that come to mind, Tahira, when we think about the building revenue synergy pipeline, clearly the water opportunity across our commercial sector, so what CH2M can now bring to our mining and petroleum and chemicals footprint, so the ECR business as well as other parts of the company, Advanced Facilities, et cetera. I'd say you hit on that one. The environmental side, similarly, we're getting excited about now being able to bring CH2M's early-stage environmental permitting capabilities to our ECR business. As another example, CH2M brought the electronics semiconductor business. And now, with the horsepower of Jacobs, we're clearly seeing an increasing pipeline of opportunities for a lot of the major programs that are unfolding in that sector with some pretty exciting things going on there. And on the Nuclear side, clearly, the combination of our deeper, more comprehensive capabilities as a combined company and what looks like a very big demand for environmental cleanup opportunities are another area that comes to mind. So, we're pretty excited. We've been heavily focused on the cost synergy side early on. And as Kevin said, we've got significant opportunity there, but I think you're going to hear more and more now over the next several quarters about a building pipeline of revenue synergies across the two companies coming together. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you, Steve. And as a follow-up and maybe perhaps this is more for Kevin, as you look out beyond fiscal year 2018, you seem to be hinting of opportunities for margin expansion partly just because the macro environment and revenue synergies seem to be shaping up well but also perhaps from more visible appearance of some of the cost synergies. As you look into fiscal year 2019, which would you identify as the more prominent driver of potential margin upside, the cost synergies or the business itself or maybe perhaps they're equal? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, let me just start. Our ECR business, I think I focused on my comments there that we're very confident that we're going to be able to continue to drive margin improvement in that business, and that will be all sort of centered around the type of business that we're winning, the project delivery excellence that has been demonstrated over the last couple of years as part of our new focus on our center of excellence capabilities in project delivery and the whole cost synergy opportunity there as well. So, I think you're going to see ECR continue to be an area of opportunity for us there. But as we do benefit from the scale of combining these two companies, as we grow aggressively in ATEN and BIAF, we're also going to see the benefit of that more efficient, productive cost structure showing the benefits of operating profit margin improvement in those two businesses as well. Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you, Steve, and congrats again on a good quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Good morning. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Morning, Chad. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I just wanted to focus a little bit on your commentary about share gains in the ATEN business. Can you just talk about what you've changed to unlock this growth and how sustainable you think this is? And then relatedly, do you think you can keep the ATEN backlog growing as you exit this year on a pro forma basis? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, there's several things that have contributed to the share gains. I think it does start with sort of the business model that Terry Hagen and his team have developed over the last several years as the outcome of the strategy, and that is it all starts with an industry-leading program and project execution. It's clearly a leader within Jacobs, and it's a leader in the industry. And specifically, the cost base that we've been able to develop, which is not only low cost but flexible to align with what the client needs program to program, so it can be tailored specifically to whatever client opportunity we're working with especially in the government side. And as I mentioned, that's proved to be a differentiator versus the rest of the industry. But the other piece is the organic and inorganic strategy that's unfolding. The acquisitions that we made over the last couple of years in cybersecurity and IT all started with the FNS acquisition several years ago and then Blue Canopy and others that have given us a growing footprint in the whole IT sector, cybersecurity, which we didn't have at Jacobs five years ago. And so, when you look at the share gains we made in that sector, I think we've only just scratched the surface of the opportunity because we'll not only be able to use that in this specific government services sector of ATEN but be able to take that as part of our Jacobs connected enterprise offering across our BIAF and ECR sectors, which is already unfolding. So, I think those are examples of how we're getting share gains, and there's several other factors that go into it as well. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: I think the other point, Chad, to augment Steve's comments, if you think about the businesses that have come into Jacobs from the CH2M of very strong nuclear and environmental work where we're now poised and positioned to be having access to projects that are the most complex in the world where prior to the acquisition, we didn't have as much of that pedigree. So, we've not only, as Steve was highlighting, augmented and solidified our strategy going forward on the legacy Jacobs ATEN stuff, but the environmental and nuclear parts of the portfolio are also positioning us well to compete at a higher level in those businesses too, so we feel really good about that. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then switching over to mining, can you talk about just the visibility in that space? If you could hit on the competitive environment and what you're seeing in terms of available capacity from the contractor side, your expectations for just awards and the timing and just the nature of these awards, is it going to be more greenfield versus brownfield, and then just like the share of like the total mining project that you can actually go after. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. When we do look at the ECR business, I'd say it's the area that we're starting to gain more and more optimism across the whole commodity sector. The mining side is clearly starting to demonstrate real improvement. Still at a stage where we characterize it as it a lot of work that was previously canceled or postponed is now coming back on the table. So, we're involved in a lot of the front-end work on consulting, studies, pre-FEED, and we are now building more and more confidence that these are going to convert to full CapEx projects probably as we enter the first half of 2019. It's still what I would say \u2013 fiscal 2018 is going to be a ramp-up on these smaller FEED studies and fully expect that this is now going to start to give us some opportunities for bigger projects as we convert those FEEDs to EPCM and other services for the client. Our focus remains in copper and iron ore and a few other of the mining opportunities. And I'd say it's the same message as last quarter, very, very focused around the Latin America and Australia markets and a few other areas around the world, but those are where we're seeing the biggest opportunities. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann of Baird. Your line is open. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. Maybe, Kevin, to start out, just to really boil it down, can you just comment on the guidance? You beat the consensus number by $0.11 or $0.12 here, and the raise is about $0.15. Are you thinking about the balance of the year as essentially mostly unchanged from your prior guidance with the outperformance just being passed along, or is there a real operational tangible improvement that you expect to contribute to the balance of the year? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Well, I think there's a little bit of both actually. Clearly, we saw improving dynamics in the back half of the quarter, Andy, which was good to ultimately deliver the performance, and we'll see how that plays out in the balance of the year. But I would say there is a slight uptick as it relates to the balance-of-the-year figures versus where we were before. Look, we've got a lot of moving pieces right now, and we're focused on driving the delivery of all of the things that we're working towards in creating a single company that's focused together, aligned with culture being a big part of that. So, we'll continue to be focused there. I would say it's an appropriate guidance level at this particular point in time. I think you know that we don't go overboard on our guidance by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it's an appropriate and prudent step to have taken. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: You made a couple of comments in ATEN and the BIAF segments about kind of your outlook. It sounded like there's some optimism generally in ECR, but could you just give us a sense of what you're expecting there in the margins recognizing that they were up if you adjust for the India Welfare item? And I just want to get your sense on specifically what you think that margin can do in terms of organic revenue margins for the balance of the year. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Look, that was a good number for Q2 on the ECR business where it was above 5% for the quarter. We think we'll be in that range in the plus 5%, hopefully, kind of range or thereabouts. So, we do feel that there's opportunities there. I do think it's going to be important for us as we look to 2019 to start to see some incremental growth, and that will certainly position us to be able to get growth leverage off of the gross profit that would come into play. So, I think we feel good about the improvements that the line of businesses made since we initiated our strategy. We're at a much different position than we were historically, and we're feeling good about how they can end kind of near those levels in the back half. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And my final question is some text in the deck here, but you didn't comment specifically, but I think you said that you continue to evaluate the portfolio. I just wonder if you could give an update on that. And maybe specifically like given that there's a lot of changes happening inside the organization right now as you integrate CH2M, would you be willing to undertake another portfolio evaluation with so much going on right now? Is it the time because there is so much changing or do you have to wait till the dust clears a little bit before you'd optimize the portfolio? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: We're going to always say we'll continue to evaluate the portfolio, but the majority of the organization \u2013 when I say majority, I'm talking about 99% \u2013 are focused on continuing the successful integration of CH2M and Jacobs. We have a few corporate folks that their job is to continue to monitor the market and evaluate how we're doing and think about the future. But at this stage, we have nothing to discuss about further portfolio initiatives, and it's got to be all about, for the next several quarters, demonstrating a successful integration, driving the cultural success, demonstrating the cost synergies, and getting the accretion that we expect from this acquisition, and deleveraging occurring in the second half as we've discussed. And that's what we're all focused on. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Corinne Jenkins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Corinne Jenkins on for Jerry. So, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment across your bid pipeline. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: The competitive environment as always what we're battling in this industry, and I hope you get a sense that we're winning that battle across really, I think, all three of our lines of businesses at an extremely high level. And they're different. In the government services side where our ATEN predominantly competes, as you know, that's a huge market where we still have a very small share of. And so, I think our team there is doing an excellent job of continuing to gain share across the last several years and we project through the next several years, chipping away in many cases at competitors that we had not previously competed against, companies that we hadn't previously competed against. And I think that ATEN model I've talked about it and we're pretty excited about it. In BIAF, I think the key here is the combination of Jacobs and CH2M has, to some extent, started to narrow the competitive field because we bring a scale and a portfolio offering that you can bring. And we're definitely seeing it as part of our synergy pipeline. That's not to say that it's not intense out there from a competitive situation at specific initiatives. But overall, when you take a step back, we've clearly created a tremendous opportunity with the combination, the power of those two companies. And then in ECR, again, what we try to do is stay away from competing against those high-risk projects with onerous terms and conditions and really stay focused on our partnerships with our focused clients and differentiating ourselves, in many cases, getting sole-sourced awards and being in these clients for decades, just continuing to renew these relationships in a bigger way because of the broader offering we can bring now with CH2M with water and environmental and also the Jacobs Connected Enterprise opportunities with digitization and other innovation into that area. So, I think what I'm trying to describe here is that we're trying to stay away from the traditional commodity-competitive profile and really hone in on those areas where we can provide clients with solutions and really be focused on that rather than trying to win a bid. Corinne Jenkins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And you've talked a lot about the gross margin in your backlog being up. Can you just talk about how far along you are on implementing this strategic focus and how much of the current backlog reflects that strategy versus maybe something that was booked before you'd really gotten there on it? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: What we try to do in these quarterly calls is to not only just talk about the revenue backlog but to talk about the gross margin and backlog. And again, we're very excited that this quarter, as we have been the last several quarters, have demonstrated as we're building the backlog, the gross margin in that backlog is incrementally improving. And so, we're just going to remain focused. We're not going to sort of put out a projection on that other than we fully are driven by each of these three lines of businesses continuing to win business of higher margin and then executing better and better every quarter to the point where we keep that margin that we've been awarded to hit the bottom line and to demonstrate it ultimately in operating profit as a percent of revenue. And we're going to remain focused on it. Corinne Jenkins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anna Kaminskaya of Bank of America. Your line is open. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Maybe I can start off just talking about free cash flow. Any color on why we had such a big receivable cash outflow? I do realize organic growth has been very robust. So, any targets you can set for leverage by the end of the year? And if we continue growing at such rates, will a lot of cash be eaten by working capital? Just any more color on moving parts for the free cash flow for the year. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. Anna, this is Kevin. So, just real briefly, as we saw the business trend over the course of the quarter, we actually saw a very, very large chunk of sales come into play in March. So, given the fact that many of our businesses have 30-day terms, that the bulk of the growth came in March, there really was a tick up in DSO because of that fact. Our expectation is that we're not going to see that kind of going forward where it all comes always at the end of the quarter. But that certainly was a player there in terms of the accounts receivable picking up a little bit. But you know that that's part of our metric in terms of incentives. And while we don't adjust for the fact that all the sales, revenue or the revenue came in, in March, we got to go get that cash. So, we're focused on that to be able to try and drive that figure down obviously over the balance of the year. We'll be less than satisfied relative to our compensation payout. The other point is that we did have sizable one-times as it relates to the acquisition-related expenses and synergy-related costs. That was well over a couple hundred million dollars. So, we think that this is the one quarter where we would have a lot of noise. And as we position for Q3 and Q4, we expect that we'll be able to get back to where we're seeing a more substantial de-leveraging in the back half of the year. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then maybe just going back and summarizing your comments on your backlog outlook for the rest of the year, if I take some of the moving parts on the large project in your government business and maybe your comments on energy and chemical outlook, should it be steady from here on? Can we see sequential growth through the end of the year? Just trying to put all of the comments together, kind of what implied for the outlook in the next quarters. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Generally, we would say we're driving for sequential growth in the second half on our backlog. ATEN has had a significant increase in backlog when you go back to a year, over the last couple of years. And so, from an ATEN standpoint, part of that is timing as awards come in. But again, we expect over the course of the next 6 to 12 months to continue to see improvement in ATEN backlog. I mentioned the power of Jacobs and CH2M together on BIAF, and that business unit, legacy Jacobs and now combined has demonstrated over the last, I don't know, 8, 9, 10 quarters nice growth in backlog, and we expect that to continue. And ECR is where we're going to continue to stay focused on benefiting from this upcycle that appears to start showing early signs of unfolding. But I think you should expect that over the next, again, 6 to 9 to 12 months to be modest growth as we selectively pick out those areas which are low to prudent risk and long-term recurring revenue rather than getting out ahead of ourselves and getting into some projects maybe we'll regret a couple of years from now. So, I think overall, that's a positive message around our expectation for backlog growth over the next 6 to 12 months. Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Great quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Steve, there's been a lot of talk in the industry and calls about risk of backlogs and business mixes going forward. So, looking at your presentation, I noticed just especially in ECR and in the Buildings, not as much into design build or any like kind of construction mode. Is that something that are you willing to do a little bit more given the combined size and the opportunities you have with CH2M, what the clients want from you, or is it still going to be kind of measured on keeping it design, billable-hour, O&M work through those end markets? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. I think your latter comment is more of where our mindset is. We've got a rich pipeline of opportunity in what we describe as professional services. And with the combination of CH2M now, we're really seeing a pipeline starting to build on high-end consulting work as an example around transportation planning and urbanization and bringing the whole water and environmental solutions. And so, that's where our focus is. We have selective areas where we've proven strong capability to do some design build or EPC work, but those are very selective there with clients that we've had proven success with or very focused markets, for example, on the water side where we're a global industry leader in project delivery excellence and those kind of projects. So, at this time, you shouldn't expect to see Jacobs try to extend ourselves into other areas of risky construction or that sort of area and stay focused on our strategy. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good that you confirmed that. My follow-up, Steve, would be with 77,000 employees and the business and the opportunities that you have and the ability to get more diverse and upgrade the talent, given your growth expectations over the next three to five years, do we anticipate a modest growth? How is the employee base going to change? And do you have enough to fulfill and achieve the order and backlog opportunities that you see in front of you not only in the second half this year but well into 2019 and 2020? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Our line of business structure that we put in place now almost two years ago, which we've refined with the three lines of business for the new combined company, I think, is set up to be able to benefit from a large-scale Jacobs now. That's one of the largest firms in our industry and growing, but to bring that down to the line of business level where we maintain the entrepreneurial flexibility, innovative approach that tailors to our clients' needs and get the best of both worlds. And you're hitting on a point that is our total focus now on how we create a culture in this company that benefits from that combination that other companies haven't yet proven to be successful. And we're getting excited about what's unfolding at Jacobs from that standpoint. And so, our goals are aggressive. We're clearly a growth company focused now with regard to the CH2M acquisition, and we don't have specific targets that we're going to set or quote now from that standpoint. But as I mentioned, I don't think we've seen anywhere near the benefit of what the potential is from a revenue synergy standpoint with these two combined companies. So, as we get through the next year around the whole cost synergy side, I fully expect you're going to hear more about what we expect from a top line standpoint of these combined companies. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Jackson - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. This is Erika Jackson on for Steve. I just had a quick question about the cash flow profile of the combined Jacobs and CH2M business. I know that you're going to start accelerating the deleveraging in the second half of this year. Do you also expect to start hitting the full potential free cash flow of the combined business in the second half this year or will that be more of, I guess, 2019 story once you kind of finish up all the cash restructuring cost? Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, this is Kevin. Just a quick comment. I think that it really boils down to how much traction we start to get on the DSO and accounts receivable efforts with the integration of the CH2M organization. We do expect that we're going to start to gain traction. Exactly the timing of that and whether we see our end result that we want to see by the end of the fiscal year or not, I'll hedge a little bit on that comment. But it's very clear that we need to improve our accounts receivable from the mere fact that we got to do it to hit our incentive comp targets that we've established for ourselves. So, I can assure you, we're after it. And whether or not we get to kind of those target figures or not, we'll end up seeing how it's going to play. You guys have heard me say about how this is pick-and-shovel work, which is a lot of day in, day out, rigor and discipline, discussing with customers, negotiating new terms and contracts that are appropriate as it relates to receivables and so on and so forth. So, we think we're well on our way. The exact timing of it, I'm going to hedge on it. But clearly, it's going to be an important part for us personally in this company to be able to get to our incentive targets we've established for ourselves. Erika Jackson - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good quarter. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, look, obviously, a big acceleration in your businesses with revenue on mid-teens pro forma, and Jacobs legacy business was up higher than that. I think, Steve, you talked about market share gains. What's interesting here is it just seems like a sudden acceleration in the Jacobs legacy business, probably bigger than I've seen for you guys maybe ever. So, maybe talk about that. Is this the inflection we've been waiting for? Because you guys tend to be, I guess, on the earlier cycle side when customers start to spend again. So, you mentioned the March orders/sales. Is it just an uptick as your customers respond to tax reform and the higher commodity prices? Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: There's several factors that, as you're asking that question, is coming to mind about what's happening with our revenue and now the growth is, if you go back to our strategy that we started unveiling a couple years ago, we explained that we probably were going to start to see some revenue decline as we shed unprofitable business or low-value business and really focus on margin. And then we committed to as we did that and started to grow again, we would sustain those margins for the most part and pivot to growth. And I think that's what's unfolded here is that we went through that clean-up phase. We ended up on a Jacob's legacy side with a richer mix of business focusing on what we said were two-thirds of the company that had higher value. We started the whole organic shift even before the CH2M acquisition started. So, yes, you're correct. When you look at legacy Jacobs from a year, two years ago to this quarter, we've clearly demonstrated organic growth. And then you tack on CH2M, which from the data that I'm looking at, also showed organic growth from \u2013 second quarter revenue growth from second quarter last year to second quarter this year. And so, you put the combined companies together and start to now drive the benefit of the portfolio strength that we have as one combined company. We fully expect that this growth track is going to continue to benefit us from a from a P&L revenue standpoint over the next several years. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Just a quick other comment too, Andrew. As you may recall, Q2 of year ago was the point that we reached the lowest kind of level of revenue, and that's when we were talking about this pivoting to the growth factor. So, if you do look at the year-ago figures, it is that point where we kind of said okay, now it's going to start sequentially growing, which is what happened. So, part of this acceleration that's been building over the time, it's just comparing to that last quarter a year ago, which was quite low. And so, look, I don't think we're going to be growing at mid-teen numbers necessarily over the balance of the year because now we're starting to be comparing to figures that started to see some growth inherent in them last year in the back half. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Kevin, and then just some clean-up questions, I think you mentioned for ATEN margins, 7%, 8% margin for the rest of the year. I think last quarter, for the old A&T business, you were talking about 8% to 9%, and it may be apples and oranges, but maybe you could just comment on that and versus that 7.1% that you reported in the quarter. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah, so the restructuring of our lines of businesses into now ATEN where the legacy Jacobs has been 8% to 9%, the legacy CH2M pulls it down to that 7% number. So, we now believe we're in the 7% to 8% range with the new CH2M pieces of the portfolio. So, yeah, you're right it's apples and oranges, and we still feel like there's opportunities to try and drive that forward in a more positive way. So, we'll look to see how that plays out. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Yeah. And just to build on Kevin's point because I think that's important is if you go back and look at second quarter last year to second quarter this year and take out the legal matter this year that is onetime, the Jacobs side and the CH2M side, when you're analyzing them on a stand-alone basis, both grew their operating profit margin. And so, I think that you'd put that with what Kevin is talking about, I think the whole margin story is continuing to track what we've talked about over the last couple of years with growth in ATEN. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And just one more clean-up from me, Kevin, if I could, you mentioned the $259 million in cash used in Q2 for CH2M-related payments including a final deal consideration payment. Maybe you can tell us what that is, and I don't know if you want to sort of break out CH2M cash versus Jacobs cash, but if you can, I'm just curious how you're progressing on that CH2M sort of cash generation potential that we know you have over the medium term. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: Look, I would say \u2013 look, kind of I would call it clean up as it relates to the consideration items. So, there was, for example, international shareholders and change of control-related activities, all of these kinds of things were ending up being not executed in December in that two-week stub period that we actually had. So, there's probably of the $250 million, maybe half of it was relative to that, and then the other half was on these other onetime-related transaction-related costs, whether they be legal costs, whether they be investment banker fees, whether they be internal investments we're making as well. So, look, this was a high point. That's a high point. I think it's great that ultimately, our gross debt actually went down a little bit in Q2 with the uptick in receivables that we talked about earlier with Anna's question and with this $250 million. So, I think that that shows you the power of this portfolio and how we're going to be able to de-lever it once these things are behind us. And certainly from the \u2013 I would call it the onetime transaction-related costs and the consideration costs, those things are behind us effectively. So, now, we're really talking about the investments to get out the synergies. So, that in itself will allow us to start to see the leverage that we're looking to see over the back half of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Kevin C. Berryman - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: All right. Very good. Steven J. Demetriou - Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.: So, thanks for joining our call today. And I just want to reiterate that we remain fully committed to executing on our strategy and delivering the promises that we've committed to on the CH2M acquisition. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone, to the Jacobs to hold its fiscal Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to your host, Jonathan Doros from Investor Relations. You may begin. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning and afternoon to all. Our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we'll reference in our prepared remarks. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is summarized on Slide 2.

We are under no duty to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this presentation to conform to actual results, except as required by applicable law. Please now turn to Slide 3 for a review of the agenda for today's call. I would like to note a few items in regards to our presentation and remarks today. Our results reported today include a review by all 3 lines of business. For comparative purposes, we have disclosed revenue and operating income for the updated structure reflecting the current quarter and accordingly, the same quarter a year ago. We plan to provide historical segment detail on a rolling-quarter basis. During the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current quarter results to Jacobs' and CH2M's performance 2017 calculated on a pro forma basis. The 2017 pro forma figures are adjusted to exclude restructuring and other related charges, the deconsolidation of CH2M's Chalk River joint venture and CH2M's MOPAC project. We believe, this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods. Turning to the agenda. Steve will begin by discussing our focus on driving a high-performance culture, a recap of third quarter results, including a market review for each of our lines of business and provide an update on the CH2M integration. Kevin will then provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. Steve will then provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks, and we'll open the call for questions. With that, I'll pass it over to our Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou. Steven Demetriou : Thank you, and welcome to our fiscal year 2018 third quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver fiscal year 2018 adjusted earnings per share results at the high-end of our previous outlook and well above the guidance we shared last November shortly after announcing the CH2M acquisition. Our year-to-date performance reflects strong execution against our major strategic priorities, to further strengthen our winning culture, including an increased focus on inclusion and diversity; to transform our core by executing our work with rigor and discipline; and to profitably grow by capturing higher-margin opportunities in growing end markets and delivering differentiated client-centric solutions. And with regard to the recent CH2M acquisition, we are exceeding the major cultural and financial integration commitments we made a year ago when we announced this transformative acquisition. I will discuss the Jacobs and CH2M combination in more detail later in my remarks. On a pro forma basis, third quarter revenue grew 14% versus prior year with each line of business posting growth. Adjusted SG&A cost decreased sequentially and was also lower versus the pro forma year-ago quarter, demonstrating significant progress on achieving cost synergies associated with the CH2M acquisition. Our third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.35 per share, an increase of 71% year-over-year. Kevin will cover the components of EPS, including a bridge to GAAP EPS in his remarks. Free cash flow generation was strong in the third quarter, and we demonstrated our ability to delever with gross debt down from the second quarter. I'm also very pleased to report that the third quarter backlog increased sequentially to $27.2 billion and is up 8% on a pro forma basis from last year's third quarter, with all 3 of our lines of business contributing to the backlog growth. Looking forward, we continue to experience strong demand across both our Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear line of business, ATEN; and our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities business, BIAF. In addition, supply-demand fundamentals are strengthening in our Energy, Chemicals and Resources, ECR sector, where we are taking a disciplined approach to capturing opportunities in an improving market. Turning to Slide 5. As I highlighted earlier, culture is a key component of our strategy, and our people are the heart of our business. To that end, we believe, inclusion and diversity are critical to enhancing employee engagement, retaining and attracting industry-leading talent as well as creating a framework for cross-business collaboration, all necessary for achieving profitable growth. Our employee network groups are an important driver of inclusion and diversity and offer our employees an opportunity to connect with others around the world. This picture is from an inaugural global employee network group summit, where 7 employee networks of Jacobs and CH2M came together to charter their purpose and business objectives going forward. The summit was an important step to further accelerate our journey of creating a differentiated professional services company. More than 25,000 Jacobs' employees around the globe identify with one of these network groups, and I could tell you that their enthusiasm is infectious. Before turning to the next slide, I would like to note that when the recent wildfires drove some of our employees and families out of their homes around our Redding, California office, our employees setup an emergency fund contributing tens of thousands of dollars within just 1 week, showing just how authentic our culture of caring is at Jacobs. Turning to Slide 6. Our third quarter revenue and backlog was strong at $27.2 billion, up approximately $700 million versus last quarter. On a pro forma basis, total backlog increased 8% or approximately $2 billion, compared to last year's third quarter. We saw an acceleration in field services backlog, which was driven by an increase in major water infrastructure and life sciences design-build projects. From a line of business perspective, on a pro forma basis, ATEN backlog was up 12% year-over-year, while BIAF increased by 8% and ECR up 3%. Gross margin and backlog is up more than 100 basis points year-over-year, on a reported basis, driven by the higher-margin mix from CH2M. Our Jacobs and CH2M sales teams are now integrated and capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities to leverage each other's strengths, evidenced by our strong bookings and gross margin and backlog performance across the company. Turning to Slide 7. Now let me discuss the performance by line of business, beginning with Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear, ATEN. We posted a strong quarter in ATEN with revenue reaching $1.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and operating profit up more than 22%. The successful ramp-up of our previously awarded major wins, including the Missile Defense Agency and Special Operations Command, are key drivers to this double-digit revenue and profit growth. Backlog was up 12% versus last year's combined third quarter with both legacy Jacobs and CH2M contributing to the growth. And I'm also pleased that the gross margin in the ATEN backlog increased year-over-year. From an end market standpoint, we are benefiting from plus-ups across our major government customers such as the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, intelligence community and NASA. Within our commercial markets, the 5G wireless build-out continues to provide a robust opportunity for growth with another AT&T win in the quarter. From a competitive standpoint, we believe, the highly-fragmented nature of the government services market plays into our strategy that combines strong technical expertise, a unique localized delivery model and an industry-leading efficient cost structure in order to gain market share. On the back of posting strong double-digit growth in fiscal 2018, we are encouraged that our ATEN pipeline supports further growth over the next several years. Within that pipeline, some of the major opportunities include large-scale nuclear cleanup projects, incremental space opportunities with NASA as well as overall demand for IT, cyber and analytics capabilities. During the quarter, we were awarded a scope increase at West Valley nuclear remediation site, and the DOE announced the extension of our plateau remediation contract at Hanford. Our nuclear strength positions us well to capture incremental opportunities during the upcoming DOE nuclear procurement cycle. Within our Environmental business, we were awarded a contract to provide the Defense Threat Reduction Agency solutions for sustainable chemical, biological and other threat reduction capabilities. This win demonstrates the technical expertise and differentiation that CH2M brings to Jacobs. While CH2M integration growth synergies are a clear focus at this time, I'm pleased to also note that our previous acquisitions in the cybersecurity and analytics market such as Blue Canopy and Van Dyke are also driving revenue synergies. For example, across all of Jacobs, our commercial, private and other public clients are seeking ATEN's unique and deep expertise in areas such as at-scale network vulnerability assessments, cloud-based security operations management and organically developed software solutions to solve many complex cyber and AI initiatives. In summary, the ATEN business is executing well against its strategy and positioned to deliver a double-digit year-over-year profit increase in fiscal 2018 with continued strong growth into 2019. Now on to Slide 8 to discuss our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities line of business, which posted another solid quarter of results. On a pro forma basis, BIAF revenue increased 5% versus last year's third quarter and delivered an 80 basis point increase in operating profit margin on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, revenue and backlog was up nearly $1 billion versus pro forma last year. Overall, we are experiencing strong demand, driven by population growth, aging infrastructure and increased urbanization with robust growth in the U.S., Middle East and Asia markets. The U.K. is holding steady in spite of uncertainty in that region. Specifically in the U.S., which makes up over half of our BIAF revenue, we are seeing particular strength in the West Coast, Texas and in the southeast. Our combination with CH2M is driving increased value for our clients, and it is clear that we have elevated our leadership in many of the most crucial global spending priorities. Water is one of these key priorities and as you recall, was a major component of our 2016 strategy that drove the acquisition of CH2M. In July, I met customers and presented at the Singapore Water Conference, which is a premier event in the water industry. There were over 20,000 participants from more than 100 cities globally in attendance. Our conversations with customers at the conference reinforced our thesis that we are in the early stages of a significant positive water investment cycle that is driven by several factors, including climate change and an increased need for clean water. Our clients are prioritizing upgrades to water filtration, wastewater treatment, conveyance and distribution that have been delayed far too long. We are not only a leader across these traditional water projects, but we are now bringing next-generation technology to our clients by leveraging data analytics into our end-to-end solution offerings. During the quarter, we were awarded multiple water projects such as San Diego Pure Water and design-build projects in Arizona, Oregon, Northern California and west Texas. And very importantly, the pipeline over the next 12 months for water projects is strong. In the coming months, BIAF President Bob Pragada and his key leadership will be hosting an investor webcast to provide a more in-depth look into the water market. Another key priority is transportation, which includes aviation, rail and highways. Within aviation, we're seeing strong demand, coupled with industry analyst expectation that $450 billion will be needed by 2020 to keep pace with a record passenger growth outlook. Virtually every major airport and many of the smaller regional airports are undergoing significant capacity expansions. For example, Heathrow is moving forward with their third runway, LAX and LaGuardia in the midst of expansions and Singapore, Denver and Dubai are all planning to expand their operations. Our leading position in aviation was recently highlighted with a #1 global ranking by Engineering News-Record, and we believe, we are positioned well to further capitalize on this opportunity. From a rail and highway standpoint, urbanization continues to be a major driver globally. During the quarter, we were awarded a significant program for Etihad Rail in the United Arab Emirates to design what will be one of the world's largest freight and passenger rail lines. We've also had domestic wins with the New York City Metro Transit Authority and San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit System. Highways continues to show steady performance from both new construction as well as continued operations and maintenance investments. During the quarter, we were awarded 2 major highway projects on the East Coast of the U.S. and renewed our 15-year O&M contract with the Cheshire East Council in the United Kingdom. With regards to our built environment business, we continue to see solid demand across a variety of verticals, including the U.S. government, health care, education and sciences. Specifically, we are excited about the investments being made in the K-through 12 schools as advances in technology within the classroom are spurring state and local government funding to create tailored learning environments. Finally, our Advanced Facilities business performed better than our expectations during the quarter, driven by an upside in electronics and strong performance in life sciences. From an electronics standpoint, we continue to see strong underlying demand for more data center capacity. Semiconductor and chips are being driven by secular growth factors such as artificial intelligence, emerging chip technologies, edge computing and vehicle automation. In life sciences, we're seeing pipelines build as U.S. tax legislation is driving potential investment and cell and gene therapy advancements continue to progress. And we're seeing substantial revenue synergy opportunities in the Advanced Facilities pipeline that combines CH2M's design expertise with Jacobs' strength in large-scale EPCM delivery. In summary, the BIAF line of business is positioned for strong growth across a variety of end markets and regions. The combination of Jacobs and CH2M is surpassing our expectations as revenue synergies are beginning to materialize. And now to our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business on Slide 9. In the third quarter, our revenue in ECR increased 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, a further acceleration from the second quarter growth of 17%. The double-digit increase in revenue was driven by several factors, including increased activity in refining maintenance turnarounds and continued strengthening in our mining business. On a pro forma basis, ECR revenue and backlog grew by 3%, year-over-year. Consistent with our ECR strategy, we're increasing our sustaining capital footprint, which we view as highly recurring revenue with a more attractive risk posture. I want to reinforce that our strategy in the ECR line of business will be to continue to focus on sustaining capital lower-risk segments of the energy chemicals and mining value chain, with a high percentage of our revenue aligned to our clients' OpEx spend. That said, given recent higher commodity prices, we do see incremental client capital budget opportunities that fit within our risk profile across our ECR business. For example, we're seeing an increase in greenfield refining CapEx globally as well as integrated refining and chemical complexes. Currently, we're delivering the front-end engineering design for a number of these major projects and expect to convert many of these into a larger EPC or EPCM role. There are handful of ethane cracker projects that are moving forward. We participate both delivering the front-end engineering design of crackers and the derivative chemical complexes. In the second wave, we are involved in FEED work for one of the largest crackers as well as several global opportunities for investments in derivative chemical plants. The MARPOL 2020 regulations that require shipping vessels to reduce their sulfur emissions has reached a tipping point whereby refiners are now investing in upgrades. We are currently working on multiple upgrade early engineering works across the globe. As I previously mentioned, our mining business had double-digit revenue growth, mainly driven by studies in early engineering work. We are seeing our customers move forward with major projects in iron ore and copper. We expect a handful of the studies to convert to larger projects in fiscal year 2019. As it stands today, our mining business is approaching $550 million in run rate revenue, which is still well below its previous peak of over $1 billion, indicating potential upside in the business. From a Jacobs Connected Enterprise standpoint, we continue to make progress leveraging our operational domain expertise to capture adjacent digital opportunities within our core ECR customer base. For example, we were awarded follow-on work that is 4x the initial engagement from a major chemical customer to remediate vulnerabilities found in their cybersecurity attack surface. Overall, we're pleased with the continued progress of our ECR strategy to drive profitable opportunities. We are confident there are multiple drivers that are likely to translate into further backlog growth in fiscal 2019 and '20. Turning to Slide 10. Just 1 year since we announced our transformative acquisition of CH2M, we are on pace to exceed our commitments to shareholders, employees and clients, delivering a stronger value proposition resulting from our combination, which is being very well received in the marketplace. This is reflected in our leading position in industry rankings for major end markets like water and transportation and in Jacobs capturing the top spot among global design firms now ranked #1 by ENR. Specifically with regard to our commitment to successfully merge the Jacobs and CH2M cultures and businesses, we are very pleased that CH2M voluntary attrition is in line with preannounced levels, we are exceeding projected cost synergies, and we are delivering strong growth. As a result, we expect to outperform the 15% adjusted EPS accretion target in the first 12 months since closing the acquisition in December. And our robust combined backlog points to further growth synergies materializing in our sales pipeline. Although we have more work ahead, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made to date and extremely excited about our future. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Steve. And moving to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the third quarter of our fiscal 2018 year. Please note that during my remarks today, I will sometimes discuss comparisons of current quarter results to Jacobs and CH2M's performance in 2017, calculated on a pro forma basis. We believe this information will help provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods. Third quarter pro forma revenue grew 14% year-over-year, in line with our strong second quarter growth of 16%. We had organic revenue growth across all of our business, with an increase of 17% and 8% year-over-year, for Jacobs' and CH2M's legacy businesses, respectively. This growth was supported by a greater than $175 million increase in pass-through revenues versus the second quarter of 2018. Gross margins of 18.7% are in line with our strong margin performance year-to-date, as we continue to benefit from the higher gross margin mix from CH2M. I will discuss underlying trends in gross margin later in my remarks. Regarding G&A, we realized a good growth leverage on our G&A spend as pro forma G&A was down on an absolute basis both year-over-year and sequentially versus the second quarter, driven by increased momentum in the delivery of our expected cost synergies. As a percentage of sales, adjusted G&A was down approximately 200 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis and 160 basis points sequentially. As a result, while GAAP operating profit margin was 5.1%, due to CH2M-related acquisition and integration costs, our adjusted operating profit margin was 6.4%, a year-over-year increase of 80 basis points on a reported basis and up 60 basis points on a pro forma basis. OP as a percent of revenue was also up 80 basis points sequentially, again driven by the building momentum in cost synergies. GAAP EPS was $1.05, up 42%, year-over-year. CH2M acquisition-related restructuring charges to achieve synergies and some professional fees and other transaction-related expenses impacted EPS by $0.27. Additionally, a charge resulting from the reevaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the U.S. tax reform impacted EPS by $0.04. When excluding these costs, our adjusted EPS was $1.35, which is up 71% versus the year-ago figure. The $1.35 includes $0.07 from discrete tax benefits and a $0.01 benefit from our partial reversal related to a legal matter that we previously discussed in the second quarter. Excluding the impact from tax reform, we are on track to exceed the 15% accretion target that we estimated for the first full year benefit associated with our acquisition of CH2M. We also gained some momentum in DSO, as we reversed the Q2 negative trend we saw last quarter. Importantly, we saw sequential DSO improvement during Q3, given our increased focus on cash flow and accounts receivable management. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x for the trailing 12 months and 1.2x for the third quarter period. On Slide 12, let's look at the sequential trends on revenue and gross margin in more detail. As we have previously stated, we are focused on disciplined project execution, reducing write-downs and targeting higher-margin opportunities throughout the cycles in our end markets. In Q3, our gross margin was 18.7%, which is up year-over-year on a reported basis. Importantly, the Q3 gross margins were impacted by higher pass-through revenues during the quarter when compared to Q2. When adjusting for the impact on margins through the incremental increase in pass-through revenues, underlying gross margins were actually more in line with our Q2 figures. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 13 and begin with ATEN. Revenue on a pro forma basis grew 24% year-over-year, with growth again being most pronounced in the Jacobs legacy portfolio with strong 36% organic growth driven by recent large new wins. For the fourth quarter, we expect mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth off of Q3, resulting in double-digit year-over-year growth, as we continue to ramp the newly awarded contracts. Operating margin for the quarter was 7.3%, down year-over-year due to ramp-up of large contracts. In addition, there was a minimal 10 basis points benefit from a partial reversal of the Q2 legal matter that we discussed last quarter. Excluding this impact, our adjusted operating margin was 7.2% and in line with our 7% to 8% expectation. Longer term, we continue to expect operating margins to improve. BIAF grew revenue 5% year-over-year on a pro forma basis with growth across all regions and strong double-digit growth from CH2M. This growth was partially offset by an expected decline in Advanced Facilities, given the difficult comp we saw in the year-ago period. Operating margin of 8.5% was up 150 -- 115 basis points from the year-ago quarter and up 90 basis points on a pro forma basis. For the fourth quarter, we continue to expect both sequential and year-over-year growth in BIAF with margins expected to be in the 8% to 9% range. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we see room for margin expansion in BIAF, as we continue to drive strong project delivery metrics and benefit from the scale of the combined businesses. Lastly, our ECR business grew revenue 19% year-over-year, on a pro forma basis. Growth was driven by construction, maintenance and turnaround projects as well as a pickup in front-end mining studies. Operating margin was 5%. While we continue to make good progress driving margin expansion in our ECR business, we are currently evaluating an update in a project estimate. While this impact has been accounted for within our full year updated outlook, it is expected to have a modest impact on Q4 ECR margins. Longer term, we expect ECR margins to continue to expand as we focus on lower-risk, higher-margin opportunities and benefit from a recovery in the energy and commodity end markets. Before turning to the next slide, a note to let you know that our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $33 million, in line with the year ago. We continue to expect our unallocated corporate overhead cost to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million per quarter, excluding discrete items. We are certainly pleased with the overall strong Q3 financial performance across each line of business. On Slide 14, now let me provide an update on restructuring and acquisition costs. We made great progress in cost synergies in the quarter, and we have now realized a total of over $50 million in cost synergies year-to-date with nearly $30 million realized in Q3 alone. As a result, we now expect that our updated level of synergies for the 2018 fiscal year will approach approximately $75 million. As a result, we are raising our estimate of net cost synergies to $175 million from our previous estimate of $150 million. We still expect $150 million in run rate synergies achieved by the end of fiscal 2019 with the incremental $25 million to be gained in 2020. To achieve these additional savings, we also believe our estimated P&L cost to achieve the incremental benefits, will grow to $265 million from previous estimate of $225 million. A couple of other key points. At the end of Q3, we've achieved a run rate of approximately 60% of the revised synergy target of $175 million. By the end of the year, we now expect to achieve a run rate savings of nearly 70% of the total $175 million estimate. Also through Q3, we have incurred $153 million of the now-expected $265 million in cost to achieve these synergies. As it relates to our revised $265 million in costs, we continue to expect that a bit over half of these will be cash-related and be incurred over the next couple of years. Finally, as it relates to our CH2M transaction and change in control costs, we have incurred $91 million through Q3. We are largely completed with these discrete onetime costs. Before we move to the balance sheet, let me provide an update on the Inpex matter, also referenced as the Ichthys matter. There's no change in our expectations relative to when we conducted our original due diligence on the project as part of the acquisition of CH2M. We continue to be early in the process, and we expect that any potential resolution of this matter is well into the future. So now let's get on to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 15. We ended the quarter with cash of $800 million and a gross debt of approximately $2.3 billion. Our gross debt level is down $172 million from our Q2 level, supported by a strong underlying cash flow from operations of $215 million during the quarter. We will continue to use excess cash to pay down the planned larger debt position, as we focus on maintaining our strong investment-grade credit profile. Regardless, our gross debt leverage fell to 1.9x adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3, as calculated per the terms of our credit agreements. We are now within the high-end of the range of our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1 to 2x. We are also maintaining our dividend program. During the third quarter, we paid $21 million in dividends, and we recently announced that our board has declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.15 per share. As we further strengthen the balance sheet through the end of the year, we will look to continue to consider additional growth opportunities, continue our dividend program and reinitiate our return of cash to our shareholders via stock purchases. Now turning it back over to Steve, for some closing thoughts. Steven Demetriou : All right. Thank you, Kevin. We believe our third quarter performance is strong evidence that we are delivering upon our 3-year strategy. We're excited about the profitable growth opportunities for the company across all lines of business as well as the trajectory of obtaining the remaining CH2M cost synergies. As such, we now expect our fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share outlook to be at the high-end of our previous range of $4 to $4.40. We're also providing an initial outlook on fiscal 2019 earlier than its normal cadence, given the lack of historical pro forma results and seasonality of the newly combined organization. At this time, we expect fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5 to $5.40. Operator, we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : One, Kevin, I was surprised obviously that you guys provided guidance already for 2019. If you could just walk us through your assumptions by segment and just the level of visibility you have for 2019, so we know how much you have to actually book? I mean, to get to that number. I guess, that's my first question. And then my second question, obviously, some nice progress on the cash flow side. How do we think about the opportunity to lower the DSOs at CH2 in 2019? Kevin Berryman : Jamie, I'm not going to provide a lot of incremental details, as it relates to the 2019 preliminary guidance we gave. We decided to do that just given the fact that we got these two large organizations coming together and the seasonality of the business and the fact that we're not yet fully performing out. We thought it was a good idea to just give you a preliminary perspective. We feel good about that. We're actually in the midst of our planning process right now. So we got some more work to do before we provide some incremental guidance on 2019. As it relates to the cash flow, as you recall, we discussed in the call on second quarter that we were a little disappointed in the lack of traction that we had been seeing on our DSO performance. And we had a real full-court press in the organization and got the business leaders focused, and they've been doing a great job on starting to get some traction on that. We saw that kind of negative trend reverse in Q3, that was great to see. We still think that there's opportunities to continue to deliver improvements in our DSA -- DSO going forward and that would be into 2019 as well. So more to come on that, but clearly, we continue to believe, there's opportunities to improve on that metric going forward. Jamie Cook : Okay. So because you wouldn't answer my first question, let me just ask a follow-up. On ATEN, you talked about 7% -- margins improving from the 7% level, but you didn't say the 7% to 8% level. Am I splitting hairs here or is the higher end less achievable? I guess, I'm just trying to understand the commentary there. Kevin Berryman : No, we still have the general range of 7% to 8% for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : This is Sean on for Tahira today. So I understand it's preliminary and you guys don't want to provide too much further guidance around fiscal '19 assumptions, but just hoping to get a little bit more color, maybe just around how you guys are thinking about the top-end, maybe just qualitatively, particularly around how you guys are thinking about the commodity-oriented end markets, for example, the meaningful upside potential in mining you guys are sighting? Any kind of added color on the real key swing factors to get to that top-end would be helpful. Steven Demetriou : I think the good news is that -- as evidenced by our backlog performance over the last couple of quarters, is that we're expecting profit growth across all three lines of business. And again, we're not prepared to go into detail, but ATEN is benefiting -- will benefit next year from the full ramp-up of all the major wins that they've begun to ramp up in the second half of this year. So the two that I mentioned in the earnings call, SOCOM and the missile defense, but also the [indiscernible] and the Nevada nuclear win that we had announced earlier this year. So that coupled with additional expected bookings, ATEN is positioned well for profitable growth next year. BIAF, as I mentioned, very strong backlog growth recently and the margin's improving in the backlog, and a very robust global demand profile gives us confidence that we should see profit growth there in 2019. And on the ECR business, as you mentioned, commodities are strengthening, but where we're focused, first and foremost, is continue to drive margin improvement with performance excellence and some of the process improvements and new tools that we've implemented that are specifically going to benefit the ECR business and gain higher margins with existing business and continue to focus on sustaining capital growth. But clearly, we're seeing demand growth in certain markets more than others. I'd say the Middle East for us is starting to show some good prospects for 2019 on some of the major projects. And so we should benefit there as well. Sean Eastman : Okay. And secondly for me, I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks that the U.K. has remained stable for Jacobs thus far. I was just hoping you guys could provide a little bit of color on the size of the U.K. business right now, and what we should expect over the next 12 months, say, as the Brexit impact starts to flow through, anything you guys are planning around there? Steven Demetriou : The comments I made about uncertainty are sort of -- are statements of caution, just because it is uncertain, and we don't -- we have a lot of political negativity going on now in the U.K. But from a Jacobs' standpoint, things are pretty solid. I mean, we have excellent prospects. We have a good pipeline of opportunities. It's across all the major sectors that we talked about, water and transportation and climate change and even the energy side on some transmission opportunities. And so we're just trying to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves and claim that as equally exciting as everywhere else, just because of the Brexit and political uncertainty. But as we sit here today, we believe, that's potentially just short term, and we're extremely excited about the prospects. U.K. is our -- what Kevin, our second largest market for the company, specifically in BIAF. And so it's extremely important. We mentioned that the U.S. is more than half, but clearly, U.K. makes an important part of the other remaining size of the business along with a few other key regions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Steven Fisher : I wonder if you could talk about the pro forma revenue growth trend here. It was feeling strong at 14%, but ticked down just a couple of points. And I know, again, you don't want to provide a lot of color into 2019, but just really wondering about the trajectory here, if we should be thinking that this is going to start to trend into these single digits sooner than later? Or if that going to be still pushed off a while, because I'm just looking at the differential between the, let's say, ECR backlog growth at 3% and I think last quarter, it was 2% versus the revenues at '19. So just kind of wondering how all this converges and the trajectory of pro forma revenue growth? Steven Demetriou : So let me just start and then I'll turn it over to Kevin. As I've said, for the three years that I've been at Jacobs, revenue is important, but it's -- but overly focus on it becomes very difficult to really predict and project this business, because of pass-through revenues, especially in the area of some of the businesses you mentioned like ECR. And so I think for me, it's the bottom line guidance we gave you is really a combination of our revenue growth, our gross margin and our revenue backlog that we're gaining, the synergies and cost efficiencies that we're driving across the company, our tools that are giving us the opportunity to preserve higher margins for wins that we get going forward compared to the past. And you really just got to look at it across all of those. And I think from an ECR-specific standpoint that you've mentioned, I think equally important to revenue is the whole strategy execution of driving a higher quality of earnings business that we've been proving over the last 18 to 24 months. Kevin Berryman : So Steve, just some additional commentary. In the Q3 figures, I noted $175 million incremental pass-through for the third quarter. That's 5% of growth effectively. So just note that. And pass-through revenues kind of fluctuate, and they were a little bit higher than they normally are in the -- so I'll just make that comment and you interpret as you wish. I do believe, especially given the mix of the profile of ECR, for example, since you pointed that out, when you win these contracts and you do the turnaround, it's pretty quick-burn stuff. So you win it and it happens pretty quickly. And so you can get some of this disconnect as it relates to the -- how the backlog is trending versus how the revenues kind of come together. So I think, look, what's important is that our gross margin and backlog continues to be positive, and we think that, that is leading us to be able to ensure that we have that kind of lower risk profile in our total portfolio with an ability to continue to expand our margins longer term. And there will be some fluctuation around the top line just because of the things that Steve said as well. Steven Fisher : Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe could you just give us a little more color on the specific project that you called out in ECR that I think is going to have an adjustment in your fourth quarter? Just how far long is it? How comfortable are you that you're going to capture all the cost headwinds in 2018? And how material is it? Kevin Berryman : Yes, look, I think I'd characterize it appropriately that it's a modest impact on margins. I'll leave it there. We're very comfortable that we have the situation and we're evaluating it and hopefully, it'll even be lower than what I'm suggesting. But ultimately, we're very confident. And it can't be that material given what I just described. Steven Fisher : Okay. And when will the project be done? Kevin Berryman : It's near the end of this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann from Baird. Andrew Wittmann : I just had a clarification actually. In the footnotes to your segment operating profit reconciliation, Kevin, footnote 3 talks about a $15 million charge associated with a certain project in the quarter. But when I look at the value that you put up, like $33 million is -- seems like that's kind of in line with the range that you've been talking about. So can you just talk about what that is and help us understand a little better? Kevin Berryman : Yes, no problem, Andy. Look, we had -- yes, we had that, but we also had a little bit higher-than-normal fringe kind of true-ups, given actuarial work that was performed over the Q3, which largely offset that. So you kind of see that number, there's a plus in there and there's a minus in there, which netted to kind of the number that you're looking at. So that's why you're not seeing a big change. Andrew Wittmann : What was the other corporate charge? It seems like a pretty decent amount there. Steven Demetriou : Fringe. Kevin Berryman : Fringe, it was fringe. Andrew Wittmann : The fringe was the $15 million? Steven Demetriou : No. Kevin Berryman : No, no. It offset the incremental $15 million. It was a benefit. Andrew Wittmann : Right. I'm just saying what was the charge related to? Kevin Berryman : Project, a project that's being evaluated. Andrew Wittmann : Okay, all right. Just -- and then just also here on some of the numbers, it looks like some of your purchase accounting has moved around a little bit. It looks like it's all contained on the asset side of the balance sheet, Kevin. But goodwill is up, intangible is down. Can you just talk about what some of the drivers of that are? I guess, it's a good thing that we're not seeing the liability side increasing, but just given some investor sensitivity to this and other deals in the past, I thought it'd give you a chance to talk about some of the purchase accounting migration that's happened in the last couple of quarters. Kevin Berryman : Yes, look, the largest percentage of that is really related to our -- the preliminary estimates of customer list and PP&E fair value, which ultimately went down versus what ultimately we had in the original estimate. Certainly, some of that was in our -- in the ECR business, which we got from CH2M, and that's a big chunk of it. There's some other moving pieces in it. We do have some project accruals that are in there in terms of some potential risk. But if you look at the first two that I mentioned, the PP&E fair value and customer list values and customer -- and brand values, that kind of stuff, that's about $200-plus million of the incremental changes in the opening balance sheet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Steve, in your prepared remarks, you talked about current backlog at 100 bps, I believe, greater than a year ago. Just to clarify that, what are some of the drivers in that change relative to the CH2 backlog you brought on? Is it the mix issue relative to just the better disciplined bidding or a better environment on grabbing a little bit better incremental margins as you're being more disciplined in putting projects in the backlog? Steven Demetriou : So as we've mentioned that it's up 100 basis points based on Jacobs' standalone reported or Jacobs' standalone backlog margin last year and because of the CH2M side. We've talked about the fact that the water business is a higher-margin business and so that's a major contributor. But I'm also pleased that when you look at the overall backlog performance from third quarter last year to third quarter this year, on a pro forma basis, both the Jacobs and the CH2M side of the business from last year have grown the backlog on the revenue side. So it's really a combination of good sort of combined performance, but especially some of the higher-margin businesses that we acquired with the CH2M business. Michael Dudas : Excellent. And Steve, following up on ATEN. Of the 5 delineation markets that you put through on your presentation, what 1 or 2 -- you'll have to get through this big bump in transition on the positive side on the backlog of revenues, what 1 or 2 look more promising than some of the others? And is there a mix benefit or detriment relative to where you see the growth in new revenue contribution and new business in that segment going into 2019? Steven Demetriou : I'll just answer both regionally and sector-wise. Clearly, regionally, we see the strongest pipeline moving into 2019 in the U.S. with our core A&T business, as and evidenced by obviously some major wins, but also pipeline of opportunities. The nuclear -- as you know, the nuclear business, especially what we acquired from CH2M goes in certain cycles and where the 2019, '20 is expected to be an up-cycle on several large projects coming on the board. And so that's going to be important to us, as we go forward as well. I'd say those are 2 specific opportunities. The weapon sustainment area is important to us, as we mentioned in our strategy. And also because of the successful acquisitions and the Jacobs Connected Enterprise focus, we're expecting strong growth in cybersecurity and digital analytics, et cetera, as mentioned in my prepared remarks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : You folks have had really strong win rates in ATEN over the past year. Can you just talk about as you ramp up the revenue on those projects, as you mentioned earlier, how does the prospect list look in terms of your ability to continue to grow backlog in that business? Can you just give us a sense for the bookings outlook relative to the revenue ramp that you've laid out earlier in the call? Steven Demetriou : It's a great question, Jerry, one that I ask every quarter when we're sitting in our business reviews. And the good news is that in spite of the unprecedented or historical high win back in 2017 and '18 time frame, we still have an extremely strong pipeline of opportunities in the ATEN business. And I'm just kind of repeating what I said, especially in the U.S., as it relates to all of the different military sides and the cybersecurity side, NASA opportunities, both plus-ups as well as expanding our presence across all of our existing clients. So it's -- we -- the pipeline is strong, and so we're not just depending upon the ramp-up of the previous wins, but we're confident in continuing to put wins on the board with new business. Jerry Revich : And so just for context, does that translate into backlog growth? Can you just maybe put a finer point on that? Steven Demetriou : Yes, we're still -- we're expecting continued backlog growth in ATEN as we move into '19. Jerry Revich : Okay. And can we just circle up into the CH2M accounting so how much of the brand adjustment is greater integration? And did you get any benefit in the quarter from the accounting change in terms of the way it flowed through the P&L, Kevin? It's just a little counterintuitive considering how well the business is performing to see goodwill adjusted higher. Can you just flesh that out more in addition to what you mentioned in an earlier question? Kevin Berryman : Jerry. No real fundamental change, and let's call the incremental noncash charges associated with our business in Q3 versus Q2. Now look, we're continuing to evaluate it. We'll look at it, again, in Q4. But if there's any material change, we'll be providing that insight to you. As of right now, as of Q3, Q3 was very similar to Q2. Jerry Revich : Okay. But in terms of just the business context, I mean, what's driving a negative adjustment to brand values when the business is performing well, the trade main values, et cetera? Can you just give us more context considering the business is performing well? Kevin Berryman : The value of Jacobs is a huge number. The value of CH2M and how we're integrating it into our company and driving holistic view what the new Jacobs organization looks like has actually reduced the value of the CH2M offering. So this is a discussion about the CH2M brand. I don't want to make a comment as if it wasn't important historically for that company, but within the construct of what we're doing about it and with the value proposition it has for us, it is a very different picture. So as you -- if you were to go to Denver, for example, to the previous headquarters, you won't see very much CH2M there, you'll see Jacobs. And that's because we're driving against an aligned one Jacob entity, which is reducing the value implications associated with CH2M. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Chad Dillard : I just had a question on earnings seasonality. Historically, if -- you see sequential earnings growth in the fourth quarter, but the implied guidance suggest that, that's not the case. So I was just curious whether it's a big project winding down or differences in seasonality related to the CH2M side? I ask because if I apply the typical seasonality, the fourth quarter exit rate would suggest 2019 guidance is pretty conservative, and especially if I factor in the cost savings and the pro forma 8% growth backlog. So just hoping to get some color there. Kevin Berryman : Well, first thing, $1.35 had some discrete benefits in it, so you got to recognize that. You take the tax and you take the balance out for those items, you're really getting closer to $1.25 figure. And then ultimately, our view is our taxes will be up a little bit more as we finalize the figures for the full year. So there'd probably be a little bit higher tax rate than what we've seen in the balance. And if you look at all of those numbers, we think we're targeting a pretty respectable underlying operating result that is actually quite attractive. Chad Dillard : And just a question on ATEN. Can you just talk about when missile defense and the SOCOM projects hit the full run rate? Steven Demetriou : All of our projects end up having stages, because these are multiyear projects. So -- but I would say the majority of the ramp-up is going to be completed in -- by the first half of next year, probably more heavily weighted to the next 6 months, but through the first fiscal year next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anna Kaminskaya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Anna Kaminskaya : I was hoping to get, maybe some color about revenue synergies that you highlight in your press release on -- whether they're coming from a regional upside, any particular markets you want to highlight here. And any metrics on, I don't know, employee engagement or assumption ratios, how that has an impact year-to-date. Steven Demetriou : Right. We've clearly had some preliminary or early-on wins that we attribute to the combined company. But the biggest impact so far is in the pipeline, which is exciting, because we see the bigger opportunities for revenue synergies ahead of us. And it's really coming in all the other areas that we talked about. Clearly, bringing CH2M's water and environmental capabilities across all of Jacobs, not only in the Infrastructure side where the combined strength is winning business and more business in water and environmental, but bringing those capabilities to the industrial side like our mining business and east oil and gas business and same thing with environmental. And so we're seeing it across the globe. Nuclear, the combination positions us well for the big nuclear jobs going forward, and so that's kind of in the pipeline as well. So again, I think we'll spend more time over the next year talking about actual wins and better attributable to revenue synergies, whereas these first 6 to 9 months has been more about the cost synergies. With regard to the culture and the people, it's going extremely well. As I mentioned, attrition rates are stable, which is always a concern and challenge during a merger of this size. And so we believe that the whole integration process, the IMO, Integration Management Office, that we put in place, which we believe, is a best-in-class process, is paying dividends. We're clearly keeping the momentum up on getting out in front of our people across the globe, not only communicating, engaging, but understanding where issues are and adjusting to those quickly and, again, there's a lot of excitement within the hallways of Jacobs' offices, but also at the client level, which is equally important. So it's early. We're -- this is only our second full quarter of reporting. And we're not going to let up on the focus to just really drive the right best-in-class culture going forward on a combined basis. Anna Kaminskaya : Great. And I just wanted to get more color or commentary on your note on Page 15, kind of, you continue to evaluate portfolio. Does it relate to your existing portfolio, do you find noncore asset or is that in relation to you redeploying cash into incremental acquisitions? Or is it both? Steven Demetriou : I think it's everything. If you look at the 3-year history of the company, back in 2016, Jacobs' standalone was less than 5% operating profit margin. We finished 2017 over 5%, closer to 5.5%. And we just put on the board a third quarter that has ramped up throughout this year over 6%. And so for us, it's not only to drive earnings growth, but to continue to demonstrate that we're going to have higher quality of earnings. And so it's to focus on the high -- the best end markets to make sure that we continue evaluating our existing portfolio to make sure that those -- everything we do, everything, is going to deliver margin growth. And if there's anything that we believe is not going to achieve that, we're going to assess alternative strategies. But clearly, the acquisition side of it as well will continue to be part of our strategy moving forward. And I think we've reiterated -- we've mentioned several times, we want to demonstrate our success capabilities on merging CH2M and Jacobs, and the more we do that, the more confidence we have on pulling the trigger on other things that will drive similar performance and margin improvement and earnings growth going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Steve, maybe you could talk just a little bit more about your conversations you're having with EC&R customers. Obviously, a lot of noise out there with the threat of trade wars, but oil prices are relatively high, it does seem like you've turned the corner here in ECR. You tend to be a little earlier cycle than some E&Cs, given your sustaining model. So you said you're seeing an increasingly strong inflection of business projects, and you could see continued nice step-up in the EC&R backlog? Or is the inflection more on catching up on turnarounds, environmental spend, more of the sustaining type work? Steven Demetriou : It's both. But first of all on the trade war, I mean, clearly, that's giving some of our clients, especially on the mining side, copper, for example, some concern as they're anticipating what's expected to be a supply-demand situation that's going to be very positive for that business over the next couple of years, but yet concerned about all the trade war noise in the short term. But what we continue to hear from those clients are that they believe it's short term, that it's not causing them to significantly slow down any of the conversion of studies into full projects over the next 12 to 24 months. And the same thing I would say from the oil and gas and chemicals side. The -- for us, I think the key is that we're going to stay committed even as the market starts rising to our -- our strategy to demonstrate that we can have sustainable growth and steady performance through the ups and downs of this industry. And I think we've proved that over the last 3 years, 4 years during the down market where Jacobs' backlog reduced significantly less than the rest of the industry. And now as we go forward, we want to make sure that what we put on the board for backlog growth not only has good low risk sustaining capital, maintenance and turnaround growth, which we expect, but that as we do participate in some of the larger projects that projects that we won't regret winning and we'll be able to preserve the margins and deliver the performance as we've done in the past and even in a better way with our new strategy of performance excellence. There are -- there's clearly an appetite for more risk out there that our clients are pushing on our industry, and so we're being careful and we passed on certain initiatives in the ECR business, because we didn't feel like it met our risk profile, but there are other opportunities emerging now that do meet our risk profile that we're going to attempt to win, and we think the balance of that coupled with the sustaining capital maintenance focus is going to be a successful strategy over the next several years in an improving market. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Kevin, since you and Steve got there, you guys have done a really good job on the execution side. Maybe you could evaluate EC&R execution in general, as we sit here today. You gave -- you already gave us color on the charge and the potential modest issue in Q4, but could you tell us of the charge in Q3 was a CH2 project or a legacy Jacobs project? And you think EC&R margin could dip below 5% for a while before it comes back up? Kevin Berryman : Look, I think there's been tremendous improvement in execution across the entire portfolio, probably mostly in ECR and BIAF, because ATEN actually has -- had already had a pretty high level of execution performance prior to, but ECR and BIAF, both of those organizations have done a wonderful job over the last couple of years in improving our potential loss margin versus as-sold margin. That's kind of how we think about it. And as you and I have talked in the past, we -- there's always things that are happening. We get a little bit of a pickup, because we get an incentive payment or we get a little bit of a knock and we lose a little bit versus the as-sold margin. But the key is we want to protect that as-sold margin and go after the incremental incentives. And the amount of activity that we're seeing in terms of that -- those tickdowns versus the as-sold margins becoming smaller and smaller and smaller. Now look, we never want that number to be zero because I think that, that means that we're being too safe in terms of how we grow the business. But it's getting almost to a level where we continue to try and look for benefit absolutely. But we've gotten substantially reduced in terms of those potential ongoing aggravating kind of losses on a margin basis. And so the ECR business, I think, we'll continue to be able to have this 5-plus percent margin, I think, going forward and the expectation is we want it to be higher longer term. Could there be a blip here and there? Of course. if in fact the $15 million that we talked about, that was a Jacobs, but within the context of the holistic view of write-downs or losses versus as-sold margin, an extraordinary reduction where we're probably 1/3 of the numbers that we were back at our high point in 2015. Steven Demetriou : But Andrew, maybe -- just specifically, I think building on what Kevin said is that this is not something that we're expecting to drag into 2019, so it's a one quarter commentary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : Just a couple of quick follow-ups on ECR. The backlog, 80% reimbursable. Understand the appetite for a little more risk here going forward, but is it your desire to sustain the portfolio that's still majority reimbursable there? Steven Demetriou : Yes. No change to our strategy there. Brent Thielman : And then I guess, also in that segment as you think about going after your some of these capital project opportunities when they come to fruition, what -- I mean, any sense what the margin opportunity is relative to that 5% that the segment's been running at? Steven Demetriou : Modestly higher. I mean, we're -- as Kevin kind of outlined, we've had success in that business that is -- if you go back to 2016, we're up about 100 basis points in that business from low 4s to a 5% or 4% to 5%. And our ECR team has certain strategies to take that higher. Steven Demetriou : Okay. Thank you. Thanks again for joining our call and would like to end the call by reiterating that we're well on our way to our mission to create a new kind of professional services company, and we like to describe it as like one that doesn't exist in our industries today. So thank you again, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs to hold its fiscal fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Doros. Jonathan, you may begin. Jonathan Doros : Good morning,and afternoon to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is summarized on Slide 2. Certain statements contained in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and such statements are intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provided by the same. Statements made in this presentation that are not based on historical facts are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on management's current estimates and expectations and our currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and you should not place undue reliance on such statements, as actual results may differ materially. We caution the reader that there are a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected, or implied by our forward-looking statements. The potential risks and uncertainties include, among others, the possibility that acquisitions of the ECR business of Jacobs by WorleyParsons will not close, or the closing may be delayed, the ability to recognize the benefits of the ECR disposal, an outcome of legal proceedings and the risk of Jacobs future performance may not achieve its estimated earnings. For a description of these and other risks and uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 29, 2017 and our subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018 when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2018, as well as our other filings with the SEC. We are not under any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this presentation to conform to actual results except as required by applicable law. During the presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to Slide 2 of this presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we'll discuss our current results to Jacobs and CH2M performance in 2017 calculated on a pro forma basis. We will also discuss pro forma financials that exclude the ECR business in light of the pending divestiture. See Slide 2 for more information on the calculations of these pro forma metrics. We believe this information helps to provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business and comparing current performance against prior years. Turning to the agenda. Steve will begin with a tribute to our former CEO of Noel Watson and discuss our focus on driving a culture of inclusion and diversity, provide a recap of our fiscal year results, including a market review for each line of business and provide an update on our CH2M integration. Kevin will then provide more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. Steve will then provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks and we'll open the call for your questions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, our Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : Thanks you. So turning to Slide 4, before I discuss the results of the quarter, I'd like to honor the memory of former Jacobs' Chairman and CEO, Noel Watson, who passed away in August at the age of 82. A great mentor and friend, Noel was a larger-than-life leader, a man of character who brought tireless passion, perspective, and wisdom to Jacobs, particularly around safety and integrity. During his tenure as CEO, Noel speared the Company's growth sevenfold from $1 billion to $7 billion in revenue with corresponding profit increases. Recruited by our company founder Joe Jacobs, Noel served the firm for more than 50 years, including more than 25 years at the helm of the Company. Foremost, Watson was a dedicated and loving husband, father and grandfather. He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, their two children, and five grandchildren. In honor of Noel's legacy we've created the Noel Watson Integrity and Values award to be presented annually to Jacobs' employees who embody the upmost standards of ethics and integrity. Now moving to Slide 5. Our strong performance over the last few years has been supported by a relentless focus on culture, including safety, positive mental health, integrity, and leadership accountability. Building on the solid foundation, we are also concentrating on inclusion and diversity, along with innovation to further strengthen our culture. Recently, we held our first Annual Inclusion Week to increase the velocity of inclusion and diversity within our organization. I am personally co-chairing our Jacobs Women's Network and each of our senior executive leaders are sponsoring one of our other employee network groups. Throughout the year, our PRISM network, which represents our LGBT PLUS community, participated in pride celebrations globally. Similarly, our Harambee network which celebrates people of color is actively engaged internally as well as externally with our local communities. These are but three examples of the diverse networks within our global Jacobs family. We believe inclusion and diversity will be a key determinant of our success as it drives engagement and empowerment of all Jacobs employees, creativity to solve critical challenges, and attraction and retention of the brightest talent, which together accelerates our efforts to be the employer of choice in our industry. It is proven that companies that achieve broader levels of inclusion and diversity consistently outperform. And to demonstrate our commitment, we are instituting culture-based leadership metrics into annual executive compensation which will include inclusion and diversity goals for each senior Jacobs leader. Now let me turn to Slide 6 to review our results. We delivered strong fourth quarter and total year 2018 results that exceeded expectations. Our results are a testament to our employees disciplined focus on operational execution, while delivering a successful year one integration of CH2M, one of the most transformative acquisitions in our industry. This has translated into financial performance levels above our expectations. Our 2018 revenue grew 9% pro forma including CH2M. Our Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear business was a major driver of that growth with a 15% pro forma increase. And gross margin increased over 100 basis points and adjusted operating profit margins were up 60 basis points to 6%. As a result of the strong performance, our adjusted operating profit grew double-digits in all three lines of business. This growth led to adjusted earnings of $4.47 per share, an increase of 38% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. This strong performance combined with our proactive portfolio transformation provides us the opportunity to invest in innovation and drive continued profit and margin growth. Now turning to Slide 7 to discuss backlog performance. Our fourth quarter revenue and backlog was $27.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year on a pro forma basis with underlying trends much stronger as large upcoming ATEN renewals of approximately $425 million are not currently in backlog. Furthermore, all lines of business contributed to a pro forma backlog growth. Gross margin and backlog was up more than 100 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by the higher margin mix from CH2M and a continued focus on winning high value business. Upon completion of the sale of our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business, our pro forma gross margin and backlog will further improve by more than 150 basis points from the higher margin mix of the remaining ATEN and BIAF portfolio. Before I discuss the performance of our ATEN and BIAF businesses, I'd like to outline the significant improvement of ECR on Slide 8. With the recent announced divestiture of our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business to WorleyParsons which is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2019, I would like to take a moment to recognize our ECR team. I am very pleased with the team's ability to drive substantial value creation over the last few years. During the recent challenging industry environment, the team successfully shifted resources to capture refining and chemical opportunities and expanded our footprint into new geographies. This was achieved while maintaining a healthy risk posture of mainly reimbursable work and a significant reduction of write-downs, driven by improved project execution. As a result, ECR drove a strong financial performance over the last two years with a 42% increase in 2000 operating profit versus 2016. And most recently, the business returned to growth with 2018 pro forma revenue up 7% and operating profit margin expanding 60 basis points versus 2017. I'm incredibly proud of the entire our ECR team's passion and commitment. They are strongly positioned for future success as they combine with WorleyParsons to create a preeminent leader in the energy and resources industry. While this divestiture is bittersweet, consistent with our strategy, we believe it's the right time to make this change to our portfolio, which allows Jacobs the opportunity to focus 100% on our ATEN and BIAF businesses. Slide 9 highlights our transformed business portfolio as we move forward post the sale of ECR. This newly focused portfolio reflects a stronger sustaining revenue mix and higher value end markets aligned to growth trends where Jacobs has a leadership position, including national government priorities, sustainable infrastructure, and digitally enabled solutions. We intend to leverage our full complement of differentiated capabilities across our ATEN and BIAF portfolios to drive revenue synergies. This is forming the basis of the next phase of our strategy, which we plan to further discuss at our upcoming Investor Day in February. Turning to Slide 10. Now let me discuss the performance of Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear, ATEN. During the quarter, our ATEN business continued to significantly outpace the growth of the market and our public government services peers with 19% year-over-year pro forma growth. Key to this performance were a number of long-term enterprise contract wins with the U.S. government, including the Missile Agency and Special Operations Command, which have created a strong base of recurring revenue. Backlog was up 2% versus last year's combined fourth quarter, which more than offset the impact of the burn off by a few large programs that will be rebid soon. Together, these renewable opportunities account for approximately $425 million of annual revenue not yet reflected in our backlog. Gross margin and backlog increased 50 basis points compared to 2017. The upside to this dynamic is that the nature of these long-term large-scale enterprise contracts create strong financial stability. From an end market perspective, we are well positioned against U.S. federal government's high priorities within the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Intelligence Community, and NASA. Contributing to the stability of our portfolio, many of our large contracts are aligned to mission critical areas within the federal budget and are less discretionary in nature. Furthermore, given the highly fragmented nature of the government services market, we believe that our strong technical expertise, unique localized delivery model, and an industry-leading efficient cost structure will allow us to continue to gain market share over time. During the quarter, we were awarded [Audio Gap] transactions and personal information of the U.S. Student Financial Aid program. They also provide predictive cyber analytics to modernize FSA's security operation center and protect against threat actors seeking to infiltrate government information systems. A five-year sub-contract for the U.S. Air Force was awarded to provide software development and sustainment for the Air Force Financial Systems Office, bringing our software engineering capabilities to three core applications. We were also awarded a 10-year sole-source classified contract for continuity of senior government officials communications, which attest to the capabilities of our telecommunications, IT, and cybersecurity teams. And turning to the commercial part of our ATEN business, we continue to see strength in telecom. The business is mainly professional services such as consulting, engineering, and program management of communications infrastructure development. The 5G wireless build-out provides a significant opportunity for growth over the next five years. During the quarter, we had another key win with AT&T, continuing the expansion of our geographical footprint in the United States. We are also seeing accelerating opportunities to leverage ATEN capabilities into our BIAF client base, such as smart infrastructure solutions. We believe that leveraging these technology capabilities across the rest of our portfolio will drive additional revenue synergies. So, in summary, the ATEN business had outstanding performance in fiscal 2018 and we are encouraged by the opportunities we see going forward, including continued profitable growth in fiscal 2019. Now on to Slide 11 to discuss our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities line of business, BIAF, which posted yet another solid quarter of results. On a pro forma basis, BIAF backlog increased 3% year-over-year with gross margin and backlog up 70 basis points. From a macro standpoint, we continue to see a robust pipeline of global opportunities driven by the major trends of urbanization and population growth, leading to an increasing need to invest in upgrading supporting infrastructure. The results of the U.S. midterm elections were favorable for infrastructure spending and state ballot measures such as the California gas tax. In the UK, we are aligned to well funded multi-year programs such as the Environment Agency's TEAM2100 and we recently won Highways England's Routes to Market, a six-year program to transform England's motorways. Asia Pacific demand is underpinned by strong public investment in rail and other infrastructure investments. As outlined in our recent Water Investor conference call, we see multi-decade demand drivers for our water business, including in the near term being on the front end of a major water upcycle in the U.S. We recently were awarded several major water opportunities such as program management with the City of Chicago, O&M with the City of Waterbury, Connecticut and a more than 10-year program for California WaterFix. Water is one of the areas where we are driving innovation. As a great example, the City of Atlanta has selected Jacobs to develop the digital transformation and smart water utility action plan to define how best to align technologies to address goals such as infrastructure resilience, operational efficiency, and cybersecurity. Within transportation, aviation continues to be strong in the United States and Asia. And we recently closed a contract for design of a major terminal renovation at Baltimore Washington International Airport. Transit and rail are strong globally and during the quarter, we closed a significant consulting engagement with Melbourne Metro. With regards to our Built Environment business, healthcare, education, and federal buildings are clearly a beneficiary of the broader demand drivers. During the quarter, in education, we won a program management opportunity with the Omaha Public Schools District. We're also seeing a trend unfold for more mixed use infrastructure, which is allowing for potential revenue synergies between our Buildings Group and other infrastructure teams. Financially, our Advanced Facilities business continues to perform above our expectations, driven by our life science and electronics businesses with major wins during the quarter in both sectors. We had a sizable win with a U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturer and, in October, we closed a $400 million EPCM project with a confidential life sciences customer. In summary, our BIAF line of business has shown a track record of consistent strong performance. Revenue and margins have increased from both higher value engagements, improving project execution. Before I turn the call over to Kevin, let me make a few additional comments about CH2M. We are clearly demonstrating that the CH2M acquisition has been a strategic and financially accretive use of capital. The cost synergies that underwrote our valuation are well ahead of our original plan and our revenue synergy pipeline is gaining strong momentum. From a culture standpoint, the teams are now fully integrated and focused on delivering to our profitable growth agenda. Kevin? Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Steve, and good morning and good afternoon to all. Let's move on to Slide 12 where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Fourth quarter pro forma revenue grew 7% year-over-year. We have pro forma growth across all businesses with ATEN leading the way at 19%. Fourth quarter gross margins of 19% were up 130 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from the higher gross margin mix from CH2M. We had another quarter of reduced G&A spend as pro forma G&A was down on an absolute basis year-over-year and flat sequentially versus Q3, again driven by our continued success in attaining our expected CH2M cost synergies. This benefit was partially offset by higher incentive accrual true-ups in the quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 5.8% and was impacted by CH2M-related acquisition and integration costs. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 6.8% for the quarter, up 130 basis points. Operating profit as a percent of revenue was also up 40 basis points sequentially, again driven by the building momentum in cost synergies. GAAP EPS for the quarter was a negative $0.16, included in the GAAP figure is a $1.18 per share charge materially associated with the tax reform impact on our CH2M opening balance sheet and this charge comes as a result of our full year-end review procedures of CH2M's historical deferred tax asset and liability positions. There was another $0.18 from CH2M acquisition-related restructuring and other transaction related expenses. And finally, another $0.10 charge resulting from the sale of our Guimar joint venture in Brazil, most of which was non-cash. This JV was previously part of our ECR business. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.31, up 34% year-over-year. Our Q4 DSOs improved sequentially as we tightened our focus on cash collections from the uptick we saw in the first half of the year. This helps support solid cash flows for the quarter, but we still certainly have more work to be done in this regard. Turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 times for the fourth quarter period. Let me now review our results for full year performance on Slide 13. Our results clearly demonstrate our focused execution against our profitable growth strategy. Revenue increased 9% on a pro forma basis. GAAP operating profit margin was 4.3% and adjusted op margin was 6%, which is 60 basis points versus the year-ago figure. Operating profit for both Jacobs and CH2M legacy businesses grew double-digits and when combined, pro forma growth was 13%. GAAP EPS was $1.28 and when excluding the same items as referenced for the quarter, adjusted EPS was $4.47, up 38% versus a year ago and above both our initial outlook as well as the high end of our current guidance. Our continued successful execution against our CH2M integration plan has certainly led us to outperform against the original accretion objectives for the acquisition. Regarding DSOs for the year, we certainly did not meet our internal targets that we established for ourselves, but we continue to see opportunities and our focus to improve our performance going forward. Finally, for the year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 times. Before I turn to the next slide, we plan to file our Form 10-K in the coming days. Please note that we continue to finalize our year-end audit processes with a specific focus in the area of income taxes. As you know, this is a complex area this year given U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of CH2M. At this point, some final audit adjustments may be possible in our final reported U.S. GAAP results that would be reflected in our Form 10-K. Notwithstanding any potential adjustments, we do not expect changes to our adjusted results at this point in time. So, regarding our LOB performance, I'll turn to Slide 14 and begin with ATEN. In addition to the strong top line performance, as Steve already highlighted, ATEN delivered strong operating profit growth for the quarter and full year of 14% and 12%, respectively. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 7.3 %and 7.5% for the year when excluding the legal matter that we had discussed previously in Q2. This figure remains in line with our 7% to 8% expectation and longer term, we continue to expect operating profit margins to improve in ATEN as we move up the value chain to higher value engagements. Fourth quarter BIAF revenue grew 1% year-over-year on a performance basis. As you may recall, our revenue growth from prior quarters has been higher than our backlog growth due to the timing of backlog burn. The fourth quarter revenue growth has now corrected that differential. From a full year standpoint, pro forma revenue growth was 8%, which is more indicative of the LOB's overall momentum. On a pro forma basis, fourth quarter and annual operating profit was up 5% and 11%, respectively. Operating profit margin was 8% for the quarter, up 30 basis points on a pro forma basis. For the year, operating profit margin was 7.8%, up 20 basis points on a pro forma basis. We continue to see further room for margin expansion in BIAF from a combination of executing against our higher gross margin in backlog, strong project execution, and targeting higher margin opportunities in our pipeline. In fact, based on our early wins in fiscal 2019 and the continuing progression in our pipeline, we are expecting an acceleration in gross margin and backlog by the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2019. Lastly, our ECR fourth quarter and full-year operating profit grew 19% and 23%, respectively, on a pro forma basis. In the fourth quarter, operating profit included a $9 million charge related to the fixed price projects that we accrued in corporate expense in Q3 2018. As Steve stated, we are very pleased with the strong financial performance of our ECR business since we embarked on our strategy in 2016. In fiscal 2019, we expect our ECR businesses to be reported as discontinued operations and assets held for sale in our financial statements. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $3 million for the quarter and benefited from a $15 million reversal of the project reserve noted earlier, $9 million of which is now reflected in ECR's operating profit. For the full year, unallocated corporate expense was $116 million and at the lower end of our expected range due to continued good performance against our synergies and lower-than-expected fringe-related costs. These reductions were somewhat offset by higher incentive accruals given our strong performance. In fiscal 2019, we would expect fringe-related costs to return to more normalized level and especially so in Q1, given that we are coming to an end of our medical plan calendar year and that's when medical costs tend to be at their highest level. Now turning to the synergy numbers. Please note, on Slide 15 -- please note that given the pending divestiture of ECR expected in the first half of calendar 2019, we will now adjust our synergy commentary to exclude any one-time costs and synergies associated with the ECR component of the CH2M integration. All following figures now exclude these impacts. So, we achieved $85 million in synergies for the year. This amount is above our previous estimate of total synergies for the year of $75 million which included ECR. Clearly, we outperformed. Going forward we still anticipate achieving our previously increased synergy target of a $175 million even without ECR. So, on a like-for-like basis we are once again raising our synergy estimate and we expect our run rate in synergies to approach $175 million as we approach the end of our fiscal 2019. We also estimate the P&L cost to achieve these savings to be $265 million, with a bit more than 60% of our P&L related one-time costs being cash related. A couple of other key points. Through Q4, we have incurred a $171 million of the expected $265 million in cost to achieve these synergies. These figures exclude the ECR-related one-time costs. Finally, as it relates to our CH2M transaction and change in control costs, we have incurred $91 million through Q4. This figure has not materially changed versus our previously communicated figure in Q3. Now onto the balance sheet on Slide 16. Before reviewing the balance sheet, I want to provide an update on Inpex, a contingent liability we assumed as part of the CH2M acquisition relating to our project in Darwin, Australia. As you know, we have discussed this item since announcing the acquisition of CH2M. In Q4 2018, we have updated our opening balance sheet reserves for Inpex, which remains in the early stages of arbitration. We continue to pursue our affirmative claims against the counter party and defend ourselves. Regardless, we felt this adjustment was prudent as we further evaluated this matter over the course of this fiscal year. Importantly, as we evaluated the CH2M transaction, we modeled a variety of potential outcomes and when including the amount of this reserve, our financial model remains materially consistent with the expected overall returns of the transaction. As a result, we do not expect that this reserve, if in fact it becomes an actual cash cost, to materially impact our original internal rate of return expectations associated with the transaction. In line with our previous disclosures, a resolution of this matter is not expected to occur until our fiscal year 2020 at the earliest. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $800 million and a gross debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Our gross debt level was down $194 million from our Q3 level, supported by a strong underlying cash flow from operations of $212 million. Included in our cash flow from operations during the quarter was a voluntary $50 million pension payment we proactively made to reduce our cash taxes and pension and insurance fees. Including that discretionary contribution, our underlying cash flow from operations for the quarter was more than $250 million and represented an improving cash flow trend as we progress through our integration efforts. Consequently, our gross debt leverage improved to 1.7 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 as calculated per the terms of our credit agreements and within the high end of the range of our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1 to 2 times. Importantly, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 1.1 times. Turning to the right side of the slide, when considering the $2.6 billion in expected net proceeds from the sale of ECR, which for the purposes of this slide assumes WorleyParsons share valuation at time of announcement, our pro forma Q4 net cash position would be approximately $1.2 billion. This clearly sets us up well to deploy capital in a manner that focuses on incremental value for shareholders as outlined on Slide 17. As you know, we have a track record of disciplined value driven capital allocation, which has created strong returns for Jacobs' shareholders. As we stated when we announced the ECR transaction, our capital deployment strategy will consider organic and external growth opportunities as well as returning capital to shareholders. We'll have more details for you at our February Investor Day and as we get closer to the completion of the transaction. Now, turning it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Kevin. Turning to Slide 18, we finished fiscal 2018 on a strong note and ahead of the goals we set in our three-year strategy. Our transformed portfolio has now positioned the Company to accelerate its growth agenda in a more focused way. We reaffirm our previous fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $5 to $5.40, assuming a full year of ECR operations. For Q1, consistent with our annual guidance and incorporating the seasonality of our business, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $0.85 to $1.15, including ECR. Until we close the sale of ECR, we will continue to provide EPS guidance on a quarterly basis. Consistent with the announced transaction, we continue to expect fiscal 2019 adjusted pro forma EBITDA excluding ECR on a full year basis to be in the range of $920 million to $1 billion. We continue to work on the next phase of our strategy and we look forward to sharing this with you at our Investor Day in February. Operator, we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lucy Guo with Cowen and Company. Lucy, your line is open. Lucy Guo : First question is, if you maybe talk about the new Jacobs segments ATEN and BIAF and where your early thoughts may be for the FY19 outlook. And also, if you could address the free cash conversion characteristics for the new Jacobs going forward? Steve Demetriou : Good morning, Lucy. Thanks for the question. So we're very positive about both our lines of businesses that you mentioned ATEN and BIAF as we go into fiscal year 2019. ATEN, we've got a very strong sales pipeline that we're confident will drive profitable growth in both fiscal year '19 as well as into fiscal year '20 that we believe we're in all the right areas with regard to that business, long duration recurring revenue contracts. Over 90% of that business are these long-term contracts and also our pipeline is significantly stronger as we enter 2019 compared to 2018. And so, whether it's intelligence community, defense, cyber, SOCOM, Missile Defense, we've got a rich pipeline as well as military infrastructure and, as I mentioned, some of the commercial activities around 5G et cetera. On BIAF, similarly, we're very excited about the pipeline of our business. What's come out of the mid-term elections is extremely positive for this business and we see a very robust pipeline of opportunities in the Americas around transportation, both rail and highways. Aviation continues to be extremely strong in the U.S. Water, as a result of all the drivers of aged infrastructure, climate change, resilience, is extremely strong in the U.S. And on the advanced facility side in the U.S., both life sciences and electronics, we have a pretty rich pipeline of activity going forward. Outside of the U.S., Middle East is extremely strong, almost across the board similar to the U.S. story. We've got tremendous opportunity in aviation in the Middle East as well as Australia and India. And even in the UK with its Brexit uncertainty, the scope and scale of all our UK programs continues to move forward and we're penetrating broader Europe and so we're pretty positive about the outlook for 2019 in BIAF as well. Kevin, on the free cash flow conversion? Kevin Berryman : Yeah. We talked, Lucy, when we did the announcement on the ECR transaction is that, fundamentally, there's two things that are going to help us going forward with kind of our new portfolio after the transaction closes. First one is that the ECR business, while having done a great job in improving its margin profile over the last two or three years, is still the lowest margin business that we have. The operating profit margin is in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred basis points lower than the rest of the portfolio. So clearly when that exit -- that business exits, we will have a higher margin profile, which clearly will translate into a higher level of cash flow conversion going forward. The second piece is that the DSOs for the ECR business tend to be higher than the rest of the business, and certainly there are some structural issues associated with that business, obviously, very competitive in nature and consequently,as we think about our cash flow conversion, both of those items will translate into our results in cash flow actually improving versus where we are. Having said all of that, unlike the numbers that we were able to put up in the back half, this is kind of a messy year on our cash flow, because we've got a lot of things going on the integration efforts with CH2M, but the back half of the year, we are approaching $500 million of operating free cash flow in Q3, Q4 when you adjust for the one-time -- exclude the adjustment or exclude that one-time pension contribution we made. So we're developing into as we progress through the integration process of really strong picture as it relates to our cash flow dynamics going forward. Lucy Guo : Very helpful color. Thank you. And just follow-up question is probably on top of everyone's mind which is, your capital deployment plan is maybe with a focus on ATEN and under a couple of underlying context to that is, one, your -- the budget priorities in areas such base, intel, cyber cloud and secondly, perhaps, if you're looking for the margin accretive transactions where you can kind of both serve as 7% to 8% target. Steve Demetriou : Yeah. So we're going to spend some more time in February on our Investor Day, outlining our strategy and I think we're going to want to wait there to kind of discuss more about how M&A fits, because, as you know, it's important for M&A to be consistent with strategy. And as we finalize our next phase of that strategy, we want that to be cohesive. But you just mentioned the federal budget. I talked about the positive nature of that on our infrastructure, and we're also net positive on our Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear business. There's a lot of talk about what's going to happen with defense spending, but we believe based on our discussions on the Street as well that the major focus is going to continue to be on both parties around cyber security, around mission -- the intelligence community around the SOCOM which we're a big player, Missile Defense, also base military infrastructure where that's a big market for us. So we believe that the federal budget will be there for us to continue to grow our backlog, but also, as I mentioned during my remarks, our strategy in ATEN and our unique approach to going to the market, we're continuing to be positioned to gain share in this environment going forward as well. So to kind of finish it off, we will come back to around capital deployment and more specifics around the topic I just mentioned, across both our BIAF and ATEN businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie, your line is open. Jamie Cook : I guess two questions, probably more to Kevin. Kevin, I mean, when you guys talked about or announced the sale of the ECR business, you had some commentary regards to doing whatever you could to sort of offset the dilution associated with the sale. And I didn't really see much in terms of, when we're thinking about the guide, how to think about that for 2019. So, any update there? And then my second question, I appreciate the update on it because when you talked about opening up the balance sheet reserve. I don't think you quantified. So I don't know what type of color you could provide on that. And then also some of the partners that are finishing up various case projects are obviously having some balance sheet issues. So how that sort of -- how you're thinking about the potential risk to Jacobs with regards to that, in particular, Chiyoda? Kevin Berryman : So a couple of things, Jamie, to respond to the questions. First one on kind of the opportunity for our go-forward elimination of stranded costs. I think the way that we're thinking about this and we've already started the process is that as we look to finish and execute the final transaction close and again, we're expecting that to occur sometime in the first half of calendar year, by the time we are able to get to that point in time, we will have had very clear outline as it relates to what are the costs that will be going with the transaction to help support the ECR business and what costs will not and we will have taken actions to fundamentally largely offset any stranded costs that remain. And so our view is that that's what we're going to be able to do. So if you think about the dynamic associated with our reported results, while we are going to have a lower base versus the corporate overhead allocation, certainly the corporate allocations that are embedded into the business, we assume, we will be largely able to exit without really a lot of fundamental challenges associated with, let's call, the remain co-business. So that hopefully provides a little bit of incremental color. As we work through that with WorleyParsons, as we get to the final transition services agreement and understanding what costs we need to provide to them and how that works, we'll provide more updates, but it's true, it's a little bit too preliminary about that particular issue. In terms of the buyback, certainly the opportunity, we will continue to explore buyback on a short-term basis and take actions at minimum to offset the share creep from incentive comp that happens on an annual basis and we will continue to evaluate a share buyback in the near term associated with that. And potentially more to come as it relates to that as we work through the strategy update, clearly. The final thing on Inpex matter. Look, I think you'll be seeing the K come out in the next day or so and you'll see some incremental probably details versus what we have here. But let me make a couple comments. The total kind of purchase price accounting, the reserves that were established for the quarter incrementally versus Q3 was approximately $300 million increase, OK. Not all of that is associated with Inpex. While a chunk of it is, not all of it is. So I'll leave it there because we're in the midst of the arbitration process, the preliminary stages of that. So, certainly you can book-end it and say, it's certainly a number that's below that incremental amount that we put on in Q4. So hopefully that provides a little bit additional color for you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven, your line is open. Steven Fisher : Kevin, you mentioned and expected an acceleration in gross margin and backlog by mid-fiscal '19, I think it was. What gives you that confidence? Is that based on some bookings that you already have now in backlog after we're into Q1 and how quickly could you see that translate into reported margins? Kevin Berryman : Thanks, Steven. I think the -- it's kind of two things. One, the preliminary wins that we've seen in October, so far in our fiscal 2019, and the pipeline, which is transitioning from a pipeline opportunity to a win, which fundamentally is getting to the point where it might not close in October or the first quarter of this year, but certainly in the second quarter of next year. So the developing pipeline as well as wins to-date are creating a pretty bullish view that we have as it relates to BIAF going forward into 2019. Steven Fisher : Okay. And the second half of that was, how quickly could that translate into the reported margins, it that like a second half of the year? Kevin Berryman : Certainly the second half would be the expectation. If some of those larger things happen in Q1, which we're not exactly sure of the timing of what might happen, certainly could happen a little bit sooner than that, but I would say for purposes of just being conservative, I would say more second half than second quarter related. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then could you just talk about the expected trajectory of the pro forma revenue growth in ATEN? Certainly still strong double digits this quarter. Do you anticipate that that would moderate to the single-digit growth over the course of fiscal ' 19 and, if so, should we expect really the offset to be in higher margins there, maybe getting to the closer to the 8% of your 7% to 8% range? Kevin Berryman : So, a couple of things. First, as you know, the very strong double-digit revenue growth that we saw in 2018 was a ramp -- was largely associated with the ramp. But the underlying business was strong as well and so we fundamentally believe the benefits of the large project ramp ups is going to dissipate as we enter into 2019, but still the underlying business is strong and solid. And consequently, we're not going to see those large mid double-digit teen kind of increases in revenue, but we do expect good revenue growth. And so I think the overall kind of outlook for '18 continues to remain good solid growth. Probably more in the single-digit range obviously, and of course margin profiles continuing to improve over time. I think that's very much aligned with what our original strategy was that we outlined in 2016. And I would say, if anything, ATEN and their ability to drive innovation, not only into their own portfolio, but creating cross-sell opportunities with the remaining parts of our portfolio are going to be a driver to our ability to kind of grow margin profile longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Steve or Kevin, can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing in BIAF? Last quarter you mentioned that sales would improve sequentially, margin will be the 8.5% range and our backlog was still up sequentially, sales were down a little, margin was at the bottom of the range in the quarter. You mentioned UK is pretty solid for you guys, but obviously the geopolitical situation is pretty unstable. So did you see anything that was a little weaker than you thought? And then I think, Kevin, you also mentioned that the 8% growth you saw in FY18 was more representative of that business. Is that kind of what we should be thinking for '19 sort of mid to high single-digit growth for BIAF? Steve Demetriou : So why don't I just give a little more color on BIAF and then Kevin maybe wrap up with the trend that -- the question then was about. So on BIAF, I think sequentially if you're looking at -- if you were talking about operating profit margin, there were a couple of dynamics in the fourth quarter that had some one-time -- it was some cleanup of some past project work and that was -- that created a little noise versus last year and sequentially. And then when you look at also the strong performance in the business, there were some compensation accrual that got put in there. And when you normalize that, sequentially, our -- we had sequential profit growth and strong margin performance. As we go into fiscal year '19, as I mentioned, the opportunities are significant, and in fact, a lot of wins that we've discussed today came in October. And so those wins are not yet on the backlog when we talk about the Highways England or talk about the confidential life science or the City of Waterbury and California Waterfix. We highlighted those as recent wins, but are not on the backlog, and several of those are very significant. And the pipeline is rich when we look at what we're doing around BIAF globally. And I mentioned this, the strong U.S. I just want to reiterate, when we look at our electronics business, significant opportunity there, driven by unprecedented growth in data storage and cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, et cetera and that's carrying through not only in the U.S., but in Europe and Asia Pacific, specifically in places like Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China for us. And then when we look at the water business, the significant opportunities in the U.S. and the funding is there. One of the positive things that came out is not just the hype around infrastructure, but specifically around the mid-term elections that $40 billion of ballot measures were approved, 272 specific ones that really give us optimism around funding around transportation and water across the United States. So we are very bullish on the first half as far as building backlog. The question is just timing between our fiscal year first quarter and second quarter, but the wins of pipeline are there. Kevin? Kevin Berryman : Yeah. I think we are feeling good about both ATEN and BIAF in terms of the growth profiles for next year. The one comment I would make and it was kind of covered in some of the remarks on the call is that we have been seeing these, for BIAF, some pretty large growth levels in the first part of the year, which was -- comparing to our backlog growth, which was good, solid, sustainable growth. But the growth was stronger. I think as you look at the fourth quarter numbers, you can kind of see that we've settled back to an annual number that's probably more in line with kind of the underlying momentum. So to that point, yes, we're probably back into the mid single digit kind of growth profile as it relates to the revenue growth, I think longer term. I think the piece that will certainly accelerate our benefit to improve our margin profile again is the gross margin and backlog, which we also will assume given the earlier comments that we are going to be seeing acceleration in that. Steven Fisher : That's helpful, guys. And then just asking you a little bit more color on ATEN backlog in the sense, this was the first quarter it was down a little sequentially, obviously still up year-over-year and still good result. But last quarter you sounded confident that backlog can rise in 2019 in ATEN. Steve, I think you mentioned the $225 million of renewables will be bid out soon. So, do you still have confidence in the backlog increase and assuming that it will, should we think it's more back-end loaded or are your projects more sort of piled up toward the end of fiscal '19 or are they sort of available throughout the year? Steve Demetriou : So just a little more color beyond what I said earlier is that, specifically, the pipeline and as we dissect them, analyze the pipeline, the bottom line is that it's up 20% year-over-year which is a pretty significant number and even more specifically, we now have in the pipeline 17 opportunities valued at $100 million or more compared to 11 last year. So a 50% increase in larger programs and you know we have a pretty strong win rate in this business. So that gives us confidence around the ramp up of our backlog. So lot of that is just based on timing and also the whole rebid discussion, but we expect to be putting some of that back into our backlog as we progress through the year. So I would say, as I sit here today, we just see a sequential growth going through the year. Nothing that I can point to a spike in one quarter versus the other, just because we can't predict when these things will close. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael, your line is open. Michael Dudas : As you look at your mix of public sector versus private sector clients, maybe more primarily in BIAF, do you see any differential in growth rates or opportunities, international versus domestic? It sounds like there's a little bit more interest excitement as you mention in the Middle East and even in the UK that could help lever that growth rate outside the U.S. relative to your business here. Steve Demetriou : Well, it's tough to sort of pinpoint a specific answer to -- into that, Michael, but when we look at our advanced facilities business which is heavily on the commercial sector, we've got strong opportunities as I mentioned earlier in the U.S. and as well as in Europe, UK, Europe and some specific opportunities in Asia Pacific, but the electronics business is strong across the board. And so that gives us some pretty strong bullish outlooks as it relates to the commercial sector. And then I go back to the remarks I made earlier around whether it's federal, state or local funding as well as P3 funding, we're just -- we just feel like we've got a strong pipeline across the board on transportation, water, environmental, services et cetera. So it's -- I don't think we sort of specifically differentiate growth rates just across the board. We see a strong outlook in BIAF in all those markets. Michael Dudas : And follow-up maybe for Kevin. As you're looking through the M&A pipeline, you have the February Investor Day, the close of the transaction sometime in the first half of calendar next year, is timing of those events' milestones impactful to what opportunities that might be ahead of you relative to capital allocation, whether it's a smaller M&A, larger M&A or thinking about accelerating some of that to offset the creep up in repurchase? Kevin Berryman : Yeah. I think there's not an absolute there, obviously. Michael Dudas : Sure. Kevin Berryman : And I think that we're continuing to work hard on the CH2M integration. Clearly, we've got more work to be done. We are very excited about the work that the teams have done to-date. And the profile of the margins, the profile of the cost synergies, all of the things that we were committing to at time of acquisition are going very, very well. But we can't take our eye off that ball, obviously. But, nonetheless, it's the strategy of, as we're developing it and the update to that, it's clear that there are going to be opportunities that could become available, whether it is smaller acquisitions or whatnot and we will obviously consider those. So there isn't an absolute heartbreak that nothing will happen until which time that we do some of these things. The other point is, depending upon what's happening as it relates to the overall market, certainly we will be considering share buybacks and those kinds of matters prior to our Investor Day in February. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Josh, your line is open. Josh Sullivan : Just within aerospace and defense exposure and given that the change in the House leadership here, some comments out of the current leadership about 2020 defense budgets, how does Jacobs continue to move up the value chain in defense and maintain that cost leadership position? Is that dynamic a challenge to get up the chain or is an opportunity for you to gain share? Steve Demetriou : Yeah. Just again wanted to just reiterate that we see a lot of support and that even the changing government profile in the U.S. on the core programs that we're focused on going forward. Intelligence, Missile Defense, Special Ops, cyber, base military infrastructure and I think we've demonstrated that we've been expanding and gaining market share over the last couple of years with our model, which includes cost efficiency compared to other government service contractors and so we are continuing to believe that we are not only going to see the funding for the programs we are in, including NASA, but also that we're going to be able to continue to gain share as we go forward across the ATEN spectrum. Josh Sullivan : Okay. And then, just as you look at the two segments, what are some of the significant synergies or overlaps between the two? Do capabilities in ATEN allow you to win projects in BIAF? Maybe things like cybersecurity in ATEN for something like smart cities in BIAF or can these two segments win as stand-alone operations? Steve Demetriou : Well, clearly, we've set up the line of business structure originally in 2016 with the three lines of businesses, as we go forward with the two lines of business. With a global focus, it is setup as two lines of businesses because we believe that the size and scale of these global structures will position us to win in the marketplace going forward. And we still believe in that and that's the priority. But as we progressed and we look at just data solutions and the whole technology and innovation spectrum, we do see a connectivity that's very important and it's the reason why we created a new Head of Technology and Innovation. That individual, Darren Kraabel, comes from the ATEN organization. He was one of the senior leaders there and his mission with our senior leadership across the Company, including Terry Hagen and Bob Pragada who run the two businesses is to drive revenue synergies. And you mentioned one of them, that we think is a great opportunity is cybersecurity with the acquisitions and organic capabilities we've built in ATEN is to drive that across both ATEN and BIAF. The whole IT enterprise management success that we've had in both ATEN and BIAF which has been doing the same thing, we see the ability to further strengthen that. And so whether it's organic strategies or potentially even inorganic opportunities, we see a really a parallel focus of continuing to drive these two line of businesses forward with their individual strategies, but revenue synergies associated with connecting the two as you outline. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry, your line is open. Jerry Revich : Steve, I'm wondering if you could just put a finer point on timing of bid opportunities across the two remaining businesses over the course of fiscal '19, how balanced is the large project bookings opportunity over the course of the year that you described in ATEN? And also can you comment on any major upcoming renewals or contract rollovers you have? I believe the Hartford contract is coming up. Can you just comment on any other moving pieces we should keep in mind from a rebid standpoint as well? Steve Demetriou : Yeah. From an ATEN perspective, I think the message today around rebids is, they almost across the board move to the right, which I figure is a testament to our relationship and performance across the board. And as a result, we don't see -- we actually see stability around that as we go into 2019. And we believe that some of the rebid opportunities may start to progress in the second half, which would then come into play for 2020, but right now I would say that just move into the right and we feel pretty stable profile over the next 12 months, which means we'll put some of that back on the backlog as we get confirmation on those across the next couple of quarters. Now on which -- then I think the exciting part is, this rich pipeline of opportunity I mentioned 20% up year-over-year is really all new business opportunities and it's all part of that expansion that we've been talking about today, both market share as well as just growing in our core sectors. So I can't give any more specifics around quarter by quarter timing just because the nature of the businesses that it could happen tomorrow or may take three or four more months, but we feel very confident on continuing to ramp our backlog in ATEN steadily over the next 24 months. And then on the BIAF front, I've been very excited about what that team has been pursuing across the board as I continue to mention and some of those wins, we've already announced, but are not in our backlog. And so that creates a near-term dynamic of backlog growth in BIAF and there is just numerous opportunities across the built environment. Energy distribution is becoming a nice opportunity for us in outside of the U.S., specifically, there's opportunities in Germany to distribute renewable power and post nuclear era there that we're involved in. We're in Middle East as well around energy distribution with some significant opportunity. So that just becomes another add-on to the buildings opportunities, the life sciences, water across the globe as well as our major transportation play in highways, rail, and aviation. Aviation continues to be very strong for us. So I can't say anything other than I just expect to see it throughout the next several quarters a nice ramp up in backlog and BIAF as well and we'll see how the timing ends up. Jerry Revich : Thank you. And then separately, Kevin, just on the litigation arbitration process annexes obviously a lot of concern in the market today. Can you talk about, in the worst case scenario -- and obviously you have very strong case in your favor, but in the worst case scenario, what would the after-tax cash considerations paid be if the other side is successful because the stock value is down $1 billion today and I think the worst-case scenario after tax impact on Jacobs would be significantly less than that? So maybe you could address that head on because it's tough to get the contract structures, since they are not publicly available. Kevin Berryman : Well, look, this is -- we're in the early stages of this arbitration. I can tell you that we feel we've been very prudent as it relates to the incremental reserves that we've put on the books as it relates to this matter. So, it's hard for us to even think about something that would equate to the numbers that you're alluding to. I think that there is we've done a very deep dive on this issue during our diligence. We've done -- been doing additional deep dives over the course of this year and we believe that the matter at hand and the view that we've put on to the opening balance sheet is prudent and not aggressive from a Jacobs' perspective. So I guess I would leave it there. Look, there is a variety of ways that the folks may be interpreting this, but I'm telling you, we view this as a prudent step to take and we haven't been -- I don't think we are underestimating the position that we have to bring to the party as it relates to this matter. Jerry Revich : Okay. I guess, based on Jacobs share of the project, it's tough to get to an after-tax number that would be above $400 million, is that fair? Kevin Berryman : If you look at the reserve that's been established, as I've already said on this call, it's well below $300 million and that's a pre-tax number. Operator : Your next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Anna, your line is open. Anna Kaminskaya : So maybe to wrap up the discussion on cash deployment, can you remind us of your return hurdles on acquisitions and the timeline for those returns? And if you do find a big strategic acquisition, would you be willing to push some of those hurdles, kind of, how do you think about it internally? And maybe we've seen some of the companies in the E&C coverage and industrial coverage moving to cash EPS, if it's, I don't know, GAAP EPS dilutive, how do you think about moving to cash EPS if it is a strategic deal? Just provide a framework as we go into your Analyst Day in February. Steve Demetriou : So thank you, Anna. Let me start here first and then turn it over to Kevin. As we -- I think the two words that are going to dominate our M&A decisions going forward are strategic and disciplined. And I think we've proven that. We don't feel under any pressure to go out and buy things. We clearly want to get through our strategy work that we have another few months to go and will outline it in February. And as we did with the CH2M acquisition, which if you recall, ticked off like six out of our eight key strategic conclusions back in 2016, that's the kind of strategic focus we're going to have going forward, whether it's small bolt-on acquisitions or whether there would be a larger acquisition that would fit. We'll see. But it's going to be clearly focused on strategic fit and then disciplined around our financial hurdles, which are all about shareholder value creation, all about accretive EPS growth and improving our return on invested capital and driving margin improvement. And there is no one specific financial metric that we can tie to because -- but we believe that anything we do organically or inorganically needs to continue to drive to the collection of a financial discipline that we've been demonstrating over the last couple of years. But, Kevin, beyond that? Kevin Berryman : No, I think you answered it pretty well. Our disciplined approach to this effort in driving shareholder value, especially as it relates to potential transactions that might be considered, this is a cash return team that looks at and evaluates in a disciplined manner the amount of cash that could be expended and the expected return profile associated with it. And so to Steve's point, we have a view as it relates to how we are going to want to drive our business going forward. And there are certainly some opportunities that we believe are out there, but we don't feel we have to do it. And consequently, we'll be very disciplined when we execute and determine what the implications for our portfolio is, what the value creation opportunity is, and that ultimately will translate to an incremental return from a cash flow basis. Anna Kaminskaya : That's helpful. And then just -- Kevin Berryman : Go ahead. Anna Kaminskaya : No, I'll let you finish. Apologies. Kevin Berryman : No, I was just going to say, you also asked a question about the cash EPS. Certainly, there is noise in our figures right now as it relates to the CH2M acquisition and the amortization, and then what happens when we divest. And certainly, we will provide an update as it relates to that at our Investor Day coming in February. So certainly there are some benefits associated with that because it gives us greater clarity on that underlying cash flow, which I was fundamentally just talking about. Anna Kaminskaya : Great. And maybe just given what's happening in the market and it's a new Jacobs, have you thought internally about what the Company will look like in the next downturn, what levers you have to pull, what kind of margin profile can we see, let's say, if there is a downturn tomorrow? Kevin Berryman : Well, look, as we've talked about, the ECR sale, which again is going to be scheduled for the close -- first half of the calendar year 2019, there is a greater degree of volatility associated with that. And we fundamentally believe that our remaining businesses are poised against long-term secular needs, both for the U.S. government and governments across the world, as well as the infrastructure needs across the globe as well. So we fundamentally believe there is an underlying positive kind of secular trend that we should be able to benefit from. So we don't see that at this particular point in time in terms of there being a very large kind of change as it relates to the go forward momentum behind each of these businesses that we are talking to. So certainly, the secular trends that we've seen in the past, especially when you talk about the commodity side of our business will be eliminated. And consequently, we believe that there is a greater stability associated with our business. And when you combine that with the innovation efforts that are going to be embedded into our portfolio, which are already happening and which will continue to be accelerated, given our focus on it, that further will provide an ability to mitigate versus any kind of overall slowdowns relative to specific businesses or industries in which we are serving. So we're very robust as it relates to that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Tahira, your line is open. Tahira Afzal : Thanks. Hi, folks. I apologize, I got disconnected. So I apologize if I'm asking questions that might have been asked before. Kevin, just in terms of quarterly cadence of EPS, you've been very helpful in the past, is there more of a back-end loaded profile going forward? Is it kind of spread equally among the quarters? Anything would help. Kevin Berryman : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Clearly, we provided some preliminary guidance for the Q1 figures. You will note that if you take that number and multiply by four, it doesn't get to the $5 to $5.40 that we provided as guidance. There's a couple of things I think that are important to note. First one is the kind of cadence of EPS over the course of our year, the lowest quarter in the year is our first quarter. That's driven by a couple of things. Certainly it's driven by the kind of holiday period where we tend to have a little bit lower revenues, revenue burns associated with what's going on. Clearly, the winter aspects associated with our first quarter, the October to December time period also impacts that. So that is one thing. So the seasonality of Q1 is always a lower number and we tend to basically see when you look at a number, which is Q1 versus kind of how we've ended a quarter of the previous quarter, typically, we can range from 15% down to maybe even as high as 20%, 25% down sequentially versus our fourth quarter. So, know that our guidance for the first quarter has that embedded into it and the first -- and the other thing which I alluded to on our call was, we saw some really good performance through the last half of our fiscal 2018 relative to our fringe rate performance. And that's really driven by our actuarial teams and they do the full analysis and we've seen really good performance on medical, on workers' comp, in insurance claims and all of those things, which has been really positive. We're not assuming that that continues to the rate that it is. So you take those two things combined and effectively, that translates into a more muted Q1 figure. The other point that I would make consistent with 2018 is our ramp in synergies continues. And so at the end of the year, the synergies are larger than at the beginning of the year, and as we saw this year, clearly the margin profile was changing over the course of the year where the margins continually got bigger on a sequential basis and our Q4 numbers of 6.8% for the quarter were clearly an indication of that. And we would expect a similar dynamic, maybe not as pronounced in 2019 because of the large successes we had in synergies in 2018. So clearly, yes, just like last year, our back-end is stronger than our front-end and clearly Q1 is seasonably the lowest EPS quarter for the year. Tahira Afzal : Got it, Kevin. And a quick follow-up to that. If I look at the margins you've guided to that embedded in backlog, clearly higher. Can you give us an idea of how much of the savings going forward you're baking into them or if it only reflects really the type of efficiency gains and productivity gains you've gotten to-date? Kevin Berryman : No, I'm not quite sure I followed the total question, but let me rephrase and make sure I understand. Are you suggesting that whether or not we're assuming that our productivity gains are included into our gross margin and backlog is that what you're suggesting? Tahira Afzal : Yes. If not, I assume they are incremental as you realize them next year? Kevin Berryman : Well, look, I think, our backlog gross margin expectations include both, right. So to the extent that we are bidding on projects and we have a clear understanding of what our cost structures are, which creates some level of productivity that we have been able to realize, plus, in fact, perhaps an incremental margin profile associated with our innovation or the project itself, both of those are embedded to that gross margin kind of expectation going forward. Now, having said that, more to come as it relates to our continuing opportunities on the integration of the CH2M portfolio and I would say the one thing that remains out there is our continuing investment in our system environment which is not yet really done. We've started that process to integrate the two companies together on a single ERP platform. That is really hard work. There is some pluses and minuses, and that's a hard thing to work through when you've got the moving pieces we have as an organization but we would feel like that will start to generate some incremental benefit as we go over the course of the year as well. And certainly as we go into 2020, we'll have an ERP suite of applications, which is going to be much better than it is today. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Steve Demetriou : So as I said when we announced our portfolio transformation, we are building a stronger Jacobs that presents a compelling proposition for our employees, clients, investors, and superior value for our shareholders. We believe this transformation creates inspiring opportunities for employees, while driving a high performance culture that reflects accountability and inclusion, bringing together diverse people, capabilities, and perspectives. And amid the conversion and acceleration of significant global challenges, we are capturing attractive long-term growth opportunities and uniquely positioned to compete and win. So thank you very much and we look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in February. Kevin Berryman : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note please limit to one question and one follow up. Thank you. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference. Jonathan Doros : Good morning and afternoon to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we'll reference in our prepared remarks. I'd like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclosure, which is summarized on Slide 2. Certain statements contained in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided by the same. Statements made in this presentation that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on management's current estimates and expectations and our currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. We caution the reader that there are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of these and other risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 29, 2018, and our subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. We are not under any duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this presentation to conform to actual results, except as required by applicable law. During the presentation, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to Slide 2 of this presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results to Jacobs' and CH2M's performance in 2018 calculated on a pro forma basis. We will also discuss certain pro forma financials that exclude the ECR business in light of the pending divestiture. Please see Slide 2 for more information on the calculation of these pro forma metrics. We believe this information help to provide insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Kevin will begin with a discussion of our recent financial reporting changes. Steve will then discuss our recently updated sustainability strategy and a recap of our first quarter results, including a market review of our business. Kevin will then provide some more in depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as review our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy. Finally, Steve will provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks and we'll open the call up to your questions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Kevin Berryman, Executive Vice President and CFO. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Jon, and welcome to our fiscal first quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin the review of our results, I would like to discuss several financial reporting changes that are summarized on Slide 4 and which have been highlighted with additional disclosures in the appendix of our investor presentation. I will walk through each one individually. Number one, as a result of our recent strategy update, we transitioned our global environmental services business, or GES, which was part of our Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear, or ATEN line of business as we believe the business, will have a more synergistic fit with our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities line of business. We are pleased with the performance of the GES business, which has significantly improved its operating profit and bookings performance since the time of the CH2M. Number two, consistent with our transition effective Q1 2019 for the bulk of CH2M\u2019s legacy business to Jacob's ERP suite of applications, we have aligned CH2M backlog reporting to Jacob's methodology. We have provided a recast backlog for all of 2018 periods to provide revised comparable data consistent with this change. The adjustment is primarily related to Jacob's policy that backlogs the first two years of large multi-year contracts on a rolling basis while CH2M have included all contract years in their backlog. Number three. Additionally, we have made several changes regarding aligning CH2M to Jacob's cost allocation methodology, again, consistent with the transition to Jacob's ERP suite of applications effective Q1. The alignment results in an approximate $18 million increase in Q1 unallocated corporate costs with an offsetting benefit in the line of business operating profit. This change is neutral to total operating profit. In addition, the cost allocation change resulted in a $13 million increase to direct costs and a reduction to our G&A all within the lines of businesses, which is also both neutral to both lines of our business and total operating profit number. Number four, and on to changes in accounting standards relating to revenue recognition and pension accounting. During the quarter, we had a $6 million benefit from the adoption of revenue recognition for ASC 606, which is detailed further in Note 13 in our 10-Q. Regarding the adoption of ASC 2017-07, which covers pension accounting, we had a $4 million decrease to operating profit, which was offset by a $4 million increase to other income. ASC 2017-07 changes are neutral to net income and are outlined in Note 14 in our 10-Q. And finally, number five, given our announced divestiture of our Energy, Chemicals and Resources line of business, or ECR, ECR results are now included in discontinued operations and assets held for sale. As such, our results discussed today include only those associated with our continuing operations and exclude ECR. Importantly, consistent with GAAP reporting requirements, note that our operating profit from continuing operations is temporarily burdened by ECR related allocated costs that will either transition to WorleyParsons or be effectively eliminated at close. I'll explain this in further detail later in my remarks. Lastly, our EPS results includes both the impact of continuing and discontinued operations and is comparable to previous guidance. You will also note on the bottom of this slide some additional metrics that Jacobs will be highlighting at our upcoming Investor Day. I will discuss these items also in a bit more detail later in my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call now over to Steve. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. Let\u2019s move on to Slide 5. Before I review the first quarter results, I'd like to discuss sustainability. Last week marked the special moment for our company as we launched our global sustainability initiative PlanBeyond. Sustainability has always been a part of Jacobs, but I'd like to take a moment to point out some of our achievements, our BeyondZero commitment, where we lead the industry in safety performance underpinned by a unique culture of caring. We've trained over a thousand Jacobs employee volunteers to become positive mental health champions. We've increased the gender diversity of our executive leadership team, including the appointment of our first ever Executive Vice President, Joanne Caruso. And most recently Jacobs is being selected for the prestigious National 2019 Climate Leadership Award by The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in the climate registry. With PlanBeyond, we\u2019ll now drive sustainability deeper into our culture and operations. PlanBeyond sets out a triple bottom line priority, social, environmental, and economic, across three areas. The first area is being our people with a focus on becoming the employer of choice. Second is places, creating sustainable places to live and work. We're committing to reducing air travel, adopting sustainable workplace plans and launching a global giving and volunteering program. And third strengthening long-term sustainable partnerships with clients and global stakeholders, providing smart solutions that improve efficiency, conserve energy and reduce waste for the global supply chain. These priorities create an attractive value proposition for our employees, our clients, communities and our shareholders by ensuring we're operating sustainably and efficiently, managing our risks, driving innovation, and enhancing our brand value, all which contribute to profitable growth. I'm very excited about our PlanBeyond initiative and look forward to sharing results as we move forward. I'll now move to Slide 6 and discuss our first quarter results. We delivered a strong start to fiscal year 2019 with double-digit top and bottom line growth. The CH2M integration continues to outperform with cost synergies above original targets and revenue synergies now materializing. And we remain on track to exceed the three year financial targets we committed to back at our 2016 Investor Day. Specifically in the first quarter, our pro forma revenue grew 12% year-over-year. Our aerospace, technology and nuclear line of business was a major driver with a 23% increase. As a result of the strong top line performance, along with our continued focus on execution excellence and a disciplined cost structure, our adjusted pro forma operating profit grew 34%. This growth along with the contribution from ECR led to an adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share, an increase of 48% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our guidance. We now expect the sale of our energy chemicals and resources business to close before June 30th, which will provide a higher value, more stable portfolio while providing additional financial flexibility to deploy capital towards driving long-term profitable growth and value for our shareholders. Consistent with our commitment to agile capital deployment, we have repurchased more than $200 million in shares since December and announced an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization. While in the near-term share purchases will remain a priority. We expect over time to also deploy capital towards strategic acquisitions that drive profitable growth. Slide 7 is a pro forma outline of what Jacobs will look like once the sale of ECR is completed. Our company will become a higher margin higher growth company. As an indication of the strength of our go forward portfolio, our first quarter revenue and backlog related to ATEN and BIAF was $20.3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. And both businesses grew backlog high single digits versus last year, an acceleration from fourth quarter\u2019s year-over-year growth. Equally important, gross profit and backlog continue to increase year-over-year driven by the higher margin mix from our global buildings, infrastructure, and advanced facilities line of business. Following the divestiture of ECR, the risk profile of our company will improve with reimbursable and lower risk fixed price services making up approximately 94% of revenue. We plan to further discuss the financial and strategic profile of this transformed portfolio during our upcoming Investor Day on February 19th. Now, before I begin discussing line of business performance, you'll note on the following slides, we have moved our global environmental services business from ATEN to BIAF. This change allows us to better leverage our leading environmental services capabilities within our global infrastructure solutions platform. Turning to Slide 8, now let me discuss the performance of aerospace, technology and nuclear, ATEN. During the quarter, our ATEN business significantly outpaced the growth of the market and most government services peers with 23% year-over-year pro forma growth with first quarter revenue of over $1 billion. Key drivers for this strong growth with a ramp up of last year's Missile Defense Agency and Special Operations Command wins creating a strong base of recurring revenue. Relative to the recent government shutdown, only a small percentage of our portfolio was impacted given the mission critical nature of our contracts, but shutdown affected only a portion of our NASA business, which represented less than 1% of total ATEN annual revenue projection and we anticipate recovery of this revenue during the remainder of the fiscal year. ATEN backlog is up 8% versus last year to $7.2 billion. And actually when considering the full value of our contracts, including options and extensions, ATEN\u2019s backlog would be more than 50% larger than this reported $7.2 billion ATEN backlog. From an end market perspective, we continue to position ourselves against high priorities within the federal government and agencies such as the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Intelligence Community and NASA. While the 2020 federal budget has not yet been finalized, our portfolio continues to be characterized by large contracts that are well aligned to mission critical areas that are less discretionary in nature. Furthermore, given that the U.S. government services market is highly fragmented, we're optimistic that our ATEN strategy, which combines strong technical expertise, a unique localized delivery model and an industry leading efficient cost structure, will allow us to continue to gain market share over time. We had a very strong first quarter of ATEN wins beginning with our international portfolio where we were awarded a services contract from a confidential client to provide the design, construction assistance, systems integration and commissioning of a high altitude engine test facility. This win leverages the depth of capabilities and experience we have in test and evaluation work for clients such as NASA and the air force. In the UK, we were awarded the Ministry of Defense, Defense Equipment and Support contract to manage a vast range of complex projects for the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force. Looking at our U.S. government services portfolio, we expanded our NASA aerospace work including contract extensions at both Kennedy Space Center and Langley, and a new contract at Goddard. Our NASA efforts are deeply technical such as launch vehicle, spacecraft and payload integration along with servicing and testing of flight hardware. At NASA, Langley, we've implemented our Intelligent Asset Management program, which brings Internet of Things, predictive analytics and cyber engineering and an integrated solution to the client. It is this value added approach that also enabled us to win the asset management services contract for NAVFAC. We had two additional notable wins in our U.S. defense portfolio. First is the shallow land disposal area for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for nuclear remediation services. Under this contract we\u2019ll handle all aspects from planning through processing of radioactively contaminated soil, sediments and debris. We also won the U.S. Army's information technology enterprise solutions prime contract. This IDIQ contract is expected to be the army's primary source of IT related services worldwide. In summary, the ATEN business had outstanding performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities going forward, particularly leveraging the diversity of our capabilities. We're focused on growing high quality operating profit and expanding our margins with emphasis on mission critical government programs that brings strength and resiliency to our ATEN business. Now onto Slide 9 to discuss the performance of Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities line of business. BIAF quarterly revenue was up 8%. Key drivers for this growth were higher pass throughs, solid increase in professional services and revenue synergies from the CH2M acquisition. The recent U.S. government shutdown had minimal impact on our BIAF business and we continue to be confident in our full year outlook. More importantly, operating profit was up 28% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and in line with our strategy to focus on profitable growth and deliver against the cost synergies associated with the CH2M acquisition. Backlog also accelerated this quarter, up 7% year-over-year to $13.2 billion due to a greater proportion of our wins and large scale programs clearly demonstrating a ramp up of CH2M revenue synergies. Adjusted operating profit grew 120 basis points year-over-year to 7.8% due to continued success driving higher value solutions based BIAF business. In our infrastructure end markets, we continue to see strong growth, especially in rail and highways. We had an exciting win with the Dallas Area Rapid Transit agency to design 42 kilometers of the cotton belt commuter rail line. Our pipeline remains strong in all transportation submarkets and includes several large scale rail prospects across North America, the UK, Middle East and Australia. Jacobs was selected by the Delta Conveyance Design and Construction Authority for Engineering Design Management Services for California's largest water conveyance project named California WaterFix. And we recently received the Water Environment Federation 2018 prestigious Water Heroes Award, which recognizes organizations that have performed above and beyond the call of duty during emergency situations. Our Florida based Jacobs\u2019 operations management program teams were recognized for their efforts during the most expensive and destructive hurricane season in 2017. This industry recognition along with our global leadership on iconic water projects such as Singapore Water and Atlantis digital transformation and smart water utilities project separates us as the leader in the global water market. We are well positioned to execute on what looks to be another decade of long secular growth in the water sector. We continue to drive revenue synergies with our combined Jacobs and CH2M capabilities. For example, we were recently awarded at sizable program management project with a confidential client in southeastern U.S. for a new corporate campus. This is a direct result of our strong buildings capabilities and program management framework, along with longstanding exceptional client relationships. In advanced facilities, we continue to see a favorable CapEx environment in both our life sciences and electronic sectors. Our advanced facilities business is expected to continue its strong growth trajectory with a robust pipeline of new opportunities. Regionally, North America demonstrates the strongest growth potential in our BIAF business, which was a key factor underlying our strategy in acquiring CH2M. Despite geopolitical headwinds in the UK, Europe and the Middle East, these regions are also showing solid growth. We did experience some softness in Australia, New Zealand after a multi-year investment in infrastructure. So, in summary, BIAF posted strong financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and we're very excited about the opportunities in our pipeline. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Steve. And before I review Q1 results further, like to turn your attention to Slide 10, which illustrates the impact of ECR related stranded costs on our operating profit from continuing operations. I would note that this slide is an example representation and not necessarily to scale. The left solid blue column on the slide represents our GAAP and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations reported today. This operating profit amount is temporarily burdened by ECR related costs that due to accounting treatment requirements are not included in discontinued operations, but which will either transition to ECR at the close of the sale or eliminated. Currently, these temporary costs are recognized an unallocated corporate expense and do not impact segment level operating profit. Moving to the middle column, the shaded area represents these temporary costs that will either transition to Worley or be eliminated. As a result, post-close our operating profit from continuing operations will increase. Moving to the column on the far right, the additional shaded area represents savings that we work to realize post-close via a further reduction in our corporate unallocated costs as we work to ensure our cost structure remains appropriate based on a two LOB business versus the previous three LOB structure. In short, the slide highlights that our continuing operations is temporarily burden due to discontinued operations accounting treatment and will return back to expected operating profit levels post-close. Now moving to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. First quarter pro forma revenue grew a strong 12% year-over-year. First quarter gross margins of 18.5%, while also strong, were impacted by an increase in pass-through revenues for the BIAF business versus Q4 and the continued ramp up of the large ATEN enterprise contracts that ramped up over the course of 2018. Excluding the impact of the increase in pass-throughs, gross margin and BIAF was down only slightly due to timing and mix of revenue. Our G&A as a percentage of revenue continued to decrease as we benefited from the CH2M cost synergies and our focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure. Included in our reported G&A, as noted earlier, is approximately $15 million of cost related to ECR that I referenced, which will either be eliminated or transitioned to WorleyParsons as part of the ECR sale. GAAP operating profit margin was 3.7%. The figure continues to be impacted by CH2M related acquisition and integration costs, transaction costs related to the sale of our ECR business as well as costs related to ECR that will be eliminated post-close. Nonetheless, the margin is substantially above the year ago figure, given that our cost of the CH2M integration are beginning to wind down. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 5.2% that was impacted by the same temporary burden of ECR related costs. Excluding these temporary additional costs, our operating profit from continuing operations would have been 5.7%. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.86. Included in the GAAP figure is $0.25 from acquisition related restructuring and other transaction-related expenses related to the CH2M acquisition and the sale of ECR and $0.03 associated with impacts from U.S. tax reform offset by the add back of depreciation and amortization related to the ECR business. Excluding these items, the first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.14, which benefited from approximately $0.07 due to certain discrete tax items that were not previously included in our outlook. Our adjusted EPS that is directly comparable to the outlook we previously provided is a $1.07, which is above the midpoint of our previous outlook provided. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 for the trailing 12-months period. We were pleased with the performance during the quarter and continue to have a robust pipeline of opportunities in both ATEN and BIAF, as Steve alluded to earlier. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 12 and begin with ATEN. In addition to the strong top-line performance, as Steve already highlighted, ATEN delivered strong pro forma operating profit growth of 27% versus the year ago period. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 7%, up 20 basis points versus the year ago period. Longer term, we continue to expect operating profit margins to improve in ATEN as we shift the portfolio to a higher value mix. First quarter, BIAF grew 8% year-over-year and perform operating profit was up 28% versus the year ago period. Operating profit margin was 7.8% for the quarter up a 120 basis points on a pro forma basis from the year ago period. We also continue to see further room for margin expansion in BIAF from a combination of leveraging our scale benefits from our global market, our global model, strong project execution and targeting higher margin opportunities currently in our pipeline. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $71 million for the quarter, up just less than $10 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis, driven primarily by higher fringe related costs. As mentioned earlier, the elevated ECR related costs due to discontinued operations accounting treatment are included in this non-allocated corporate cost picture. Post the close of ECR transaction, we expect unallocated corporate cost to decrease to our run rate level of approximately $45 million to $55 million per quarter, which is higher than our previous guidance of $25 million to $35 million per quarter, all of which is due to the change in our cost alignment processes outlined earlier. Now turning to Slide 13. As a reminder, given the pending divestiture of ECR expected in the first half of calendar 2019, all of the following synergy and cost figures related to the CH2M acquisition now exclude impacts related to ECR. We achieved slightly over $120 million in synergies from the acquisition date through Q1 2019. We continue to anticipate achieving our synergy run rate of $175 million as we exit fiscal 2019. Through Q1 we've incurred approximately $210 million of the expected $265 million in cost to achieve these synergies. We remain on track to significantly outperform our original synergy estimates. Q1 also marked a major milestone in our efforts to integrate the two companies. The company transitioned approximately 80% of the CH2M portfolio of businesses to the Jacobs\u2019 ERP platform and its associated suite of integrated applications effect of the beginning of our fiscal Q1 2019 period. We executed this ERP transition at the same time we rolled out a new integrated project control system, which supported our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Importantly, we expect our new project management control capabilities to further strengthen our operational discipline. We are proud of the teams\u2019 ability to manage through these two simultaneous and complex implementations as they required significant change management focus. Before turning to the next slide, and as a final note on restructuring costs, we continue to refine our estimates on the expected one-time separation costs related to the sale of ECR. Given the significant work on carving out the assets and IT systems, we do expect that these costs could approach $150 million. These estimates remained materially consistent with the expected proceeds that we communicated at the time of the announcement of the transaction. Of course, the figure will continue to evolve as we work with WorleyParsons to finalize our transition services agreement and other transition related activities. Now on to the balance sheet on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash of approximately $900 million and gross debt of $2.7 billion. Our net debt level is up versus our fiscal Q4 year end level, primarily due to growth in AR levels given our strong growth, some higher DSOs in the quarter, a strong incentive payout, timing of payables and cash used for share repurchases of approximately $140 million. DSOs were impacted both by the timing of receipt of large payments and the conflicting priorities associated with our ERP transition and the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. We are confident that this is a short-term issue and not related to any structural change in our normalized levels of DSO. In fact, we continue to expect to see a reduction in our Q2 DSOs as we revert back to our normal focus on improvement in this area, post the ERP and revenue recognition adoption focus in Q1. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.4 times with our gross debt leverage slightly above two times adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 as calculated per the terms of our credit agreements. Given our strong balance sheet and continued expectation of improved cash flow, we also recently announced a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.17 a share. Turning to the right side of this slide on a pro forma basis, you can see that including the ECR proceeds, our net cash would be just under $1 billion giving us substantial financial flexibility to deploy capital going forward. While we planned to speak in depth regarding our capital deployment strategy at our February Investor Day, let me summarize our recent actions and philosophy on Slide 15. We have proved we not only have a disciplined track record of capital allocation, but we are agile with our execution. Most recently, we took advantage of a dislocation in our valuation by repurchasing $207 million in shares at an average price of approximately $60 per share through the end of January. In addition, the board is authorized an additional $1 billion repurchase program. We will provide details at our upcoming Investor Day on the timing of that deployment, including the consideration of an ASR for some portion of that. From a portfolio management standpoint, we have transformed our business to a more recurring, higher margin solutions provider, leveraged to secular growth trends with the acquisition of CH2M and the announced divestiture of ECR. Before turning the call back over to Steve, let me make a few more comments regarding our upcoming Investor Day. We are currently finalizing a series of new metrics, which will begin to report against beginning with our Q2 results. Specifically, we will begin to provide additional clarity on profit margins against net revenues to provide better insight as to the underlying performance of our professional service portfolio, which drives our profitability. Additionally, we will plan to exclude amortization of acquired intangibles from our adjusted operating profit and EPS results also beginning with our Q2 results. Now to Slide 16 and I'll turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. I'm very pleased with our solid start to 2019 and while there are many moving pieces to our financial results given several accounting changes. We clearly had a strong year-over-year revenue growth, up 12% in the first quarter, an increase in adjusted operating profit of 34% and adjusted EPS performance well above the midpoint of our previous guidance. And this was all accomplished while executing on an unprecedented portfolio of transformation, including the successful integration of CH2M and positioning for the sale of our ECR business. And as we look forward, our backlog and pipeline opportunities are strong. And so we're increasing our total fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance, including a full year of ECR to a range of $5.10 to $5.50, up $0.10 from our previous guidance of $5 to $5.40. And excluding ECR for the full year, we continue to expect fiscal 2019 adjusted pro forma EBITDA to be in the range of $920 million to $1 billion, which assumes the removal of ECR related costs. We look forward to sharing our new three year strategy with you at our Investor Day on February 19th in Miami. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lucy Guo from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Lucy Guo : Thank you for taking my question. Good morning Steve and Kevin. I wanted to first just touch on the solid book-to-bill numbers, given it's Q1, usually seasonally softer. What percentage of the balance robustness add BIAF and ATEN are from new business, and if you can talk about gross margin, backlog, which is something I know you track? Steve Demetriou : Right. Well, first of all on the ATEN side, our pipeline in that business is as strong and robust as ever and it's across the portfolio, as I described in my remarks. Clearly, diversification in that business line continues, Department of Defense, FAA, Department of Energy, large-scale enterprise contracts as I mentioned, but also we saw a lot of momentum in areas like automotive and telecom. In automotive, where we're a major player in wind tunnels, we're now using that platform with those customers globally to expand our business. And in telecom, specifically our largest client, we were just rated the number one provider and as it relates to quality and we\u2019re in a major trend on design build wireless infrastructure in the 4G build out and moving into 5G. Missile defense, you've seen with the federal government prioritizing missile defense, that's a core area for us. And of course, cyber security and data analytics, which are differentiating us, using our previous acquisitions of Blue Canopy, Van Dyke. And that's a key area for us, because there is a war on talent globally and our ability to automate using these capabilities with some of the technologies and tools that we have, we're able to actually accelerate growth in a challenging environment of talent. And then on the BIAF side, I think the clear driver there that\u2019s driving momentum is state, local and city support and funding. With the elections recently and the new Governors coming on, and I think it was 80% of the ballots were approved, $40 billion in infrastructure over the next several years were approved as part of that, major cities where we're strong on, Florida, California, the Governors there are driving significant growth. I mean just specifically in Florida, the new Governor, four-year $2.5 billion commitment in areas like sea level rise sustainability, $9 billion in highways, bridges and airports, California up significantly with $15 billion program. So we're just seeing great momentum in both businesses. Lucy Guo : That's great. My follow-up question has to do with free cash and then maybe if you can touch on Q2. So thank you for providing on cash flow statement in your release. Can you just maybe, if you can provide some sort of remark on how should we think about the free cash conversion, perhaps for the rest of the year and I believe you said you would provide quarterly guidance until ECR closes? Kevin Berryman : So, Lucy, let me kind of respond a little bit to the cash flow dynamics. We had obviously a couple of specific things going on in our Q1 results. And while the share buyback not in free cash flow certainly was \u2013 was about $140 million, a little bit more than $140 million for the quarter. So, that certainly was a drag on cash flow in the quarter. The final calendar year in the quarter ultimately translated into a couple of unique things, one we pay out our incentive in the last quarter of the calendar year and that was effectively almost approaching $90 million associated with the one-time cash. We also had another $90 million of kind of the timing associated with payables especially considering a third payroll run in the quarter, which is not necessarily usual obviously than normally have to. And then we had as it relates to a couple of the AR items, probably $40 million of leakage from the end of the quarter into the beginning of the next quarter relative to a couple of large customer payments we are expecting. Those were in the federal government, I can't say that those were exactly due to the government shutdown, but it certainly didn't help. If you take all of those numbers, that's a big chunk, and we think that certainly the share buyback is continuing on and our incentive comp payables and AR, kind of will ultimately go away. And then we have the last piece of that is the, let's call it the increase in AR associated with the quarter and I alluded to that, given the pretty substantial issue associated with \u2013 or opportunity, let's rephrase it, in terms of our ERP implementation as well as the revenue recognition adoption. And our people were focused on doing a good job there. And as you may have heard from others, that is a major undertaking. So we saw some leakage in DSOs because of that and the teams are now passed those ERP and rev rec implementations and refocused on it. Long story, they\u2019ll ultimately say that we expect our DSOs to start to improve, the other discrete items to go away and consequently, we'll be improving our cash flow over the balance of the year. Lucy Guo : Anything you can say on Q2 would be helpful, and I'll pass it on. Thanks a lot. Kevin Berryman : The only other thing I would say is that we're continuing on the share buyback, so that will be something that you guys should be thinking about as it relates to the cash flow dynamics. And where our teams are focused on the near-term kind of DSO and we're expecting to see some improvements there in Q2. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Themis Davris : Hi, this is actually Themis on for Jamie Cook. Just a question on the guidance raise on an EPS basis, it looks like there is a $0.07 benefit from tax and some incremental help from the new revenue recognition. So, I'm just curious, are these the only drivers behind the EPS change? Or are there any other puts and takes that we should keep in mind? Kevin Berryman : Thanks for the question. This is Kevin. The revenue recognition benefit actually, because some of that was in our discontinued operations, and you don't see it in the operating cost figures was actually about $0.02. And that $0.02 number was actually already embedded into our outlook for the year. We had a previous estimate of it. So that's not a driver to the beat. So the $0.10 I think is the recognition of certainly the discretes and ultimately the general strength of our portfolio, plus potentially some incremental benefits associated with the share buyback that we're talking about. However, I will say that we're going to be updating the whole share buyback at our upcoming Investor Day to give you a real clear view given the recent new authorization of $1 billion and what that implication is for the balance of the year. And I think with that we will be providing a clear view of what the potential impact of that is for the balance of the year at that point in time. Themis Davris : Understood. And just a question on moving the environmental business from ATEN, what was the strategic rationale there? And does that have any implications about how you're thinking about the two segments as part of the portfolio? Steve Demetriou : I think the major factor there is that, as I covered with the strong growth in infrastructure and synergy opportunities, we clearly see in the BIAF sector a tremendous opportunity to take that to an even higher level. And there was already a strong connectivity between ATEN and BIAF going on there with our GES organization, and we just took a step back as part of this new three-year strategy that we're going to discuss in a couple of weeks and decided that the best way to move forward is to embed that into the BIAF organization, but recognize that both ATEN and BIAF have environmental opportunities going forward. And so, we're really excited about that moving forward. Themis Davris : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, guys. Good enough. Steve Demetriou : Hi. Kevin Berryman : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : So Steve or Kevin, can you give us an update on pro forma growth guidance for FY 2018? Obviously you moved GES. So what you said in the past is not quite apples to apples going forward, but before we were thinking that growth in ATEN would drop into the single digits given you were ramping to the run rate of recent contract wins, but with the growth still over 20% in Q1 and backlog still up 9%, you know with that kind of burn could you average double-digit growth in FY 2019 in ATEN? And then BIAF, can you sustain pro forma revenue growth in high single digits, given backlog growth is also in the high single digits? Kevin Berryman : So Andy a couple comments, thanks for the question. I do think you're accurate as it relates to the ATEN kind of comparisons year-over-year, and as we are ramping up over the big enterprise contracts we won in 2018, the comparables have more of that base in it. And so I would say that we will start to fall versus these very strong numbers in Q1. I'm not so sure we're going to ultimately get to a double-digit number, but we'll be approaching it for sure. So I think that you kind of have a pretty good read on the situation for ATN. I think the opposite will be the case in BIAF actually. I think the pipeline of opportunities are developing really nicely. And while we probably won't see that ramp a substance until the back half of the year, we see the growth profile kind of ramping in the back half and consequently a much stronger end to the year than the beginning of the year, even though the first quarter is not too shabby. So we're liking the outlook for BIAF in the back half, where the ATEN kind of is a little bit more muted as we compare against those stronger comparables in the back half of 2018. So all in all, a pretty good solid outlook for the year in terms of revenue. Andy Kaplowitz : Kevin, that's helpful. And then Kevin or Steve, we know you don't want to front run your own Investor Day, but you did say in today's earnings release that you are on track to meet or exceed your prior three-year strategy targets. So as we think about what you might say in a couple weeks, is it safe to assume that given an improved mix of higher growth, higher barrier to entry and less cyclical businesses like ex-ECR that you should be able to grow faster than 2% to 4% over a cycle, and then you have the capability to grow operating margin more than 100 basis points to 150 basis points that you are guiding to back in 2016 for this new three-year target? Steve Demetriou : Without giving any specifics because we'd rather save that for next couple of weeks, we\u2019re clearly, I hope you got from our remarks today, we're pretty bullish on a multi-year secular trends in both businesses. And so, we'll lay out that growth, but we're excited about it. And more importantly is the bottom line growth. And just to go back to your first question, even with the shift of environmental over to BIAF, both businesses, the forecast and the earnings guidance we gave assumes that both business end up total year double-digit operating profit growth. And so as you can imagine looking forward to our strategy, you're going to hear information around not only revenue growth, but more importantly margin expectations and we've always said we\u2019ll always be a company that's going to be driving margin growth and obviously tying it all to the bottom line and then cash flow conversion. So we're looking forward to laying that out in two weeks. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks. Steve. We\u2019ll see in Florida. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Michael Dudas : Good morning, everybody. First question, Steve or Kevin. As you look at the \u2013 you talked about and referred to quite a bit of very strong pipeline in both ATEN and BIAF, is the mix of those new opportunities and given new skill sets that Jacobs has developed over the last couple of years, do you anticipate the mix of the new business that you would be booking in both of those sectors to be at or better than the backlog that you booked the last year, year and a half? And is that a market issue or more of an internal Jacobs' issue? Steve Demetriou : Well I think it \u2013 clearly when you just profile the ATEN and BIAF business, we continue to do a great job as \u2013 and that's why we're talking about exceeding our previous strategy. And really earmarking where we believe the highest value businesses are and where we can differentiate ourselves and bring this unique combination of capabilities of CH2M and Jacobs that the rest of the industry is unable to do, and that has led to most recently higher margins in our backlog. And so as we've been talking about more than two years now, every quarter, we've been seeing our backlog pick up on margin. We saw that again this last quarter. And that's clearly going to be part of what you're going to hear in a couple of weeks is how we're going to focus on higher margin, higher profit growth businesses. And so, generally, I would say the answer to your question, Mike, is yes. Michael Dudas : Thank you. And my follow-up to Steve is, relative to that opportunity what you are going to share with us in a couple of weeks, how do you characterize your labor, the people that you have on, do you have enough professionals to meet the expectations you see this year over the next couple of years? And certainly with some of the awards and recognitions that Jacobs appears to be \u2013 have received very favorably over the last several months, how is that helping in what you call the talent war and trying to get the bodies required to generate the profits and the revenues that you anticipate over the next several years? Steve Demetriou : Great, that's a great question and that's why you hear a lot from Jacobs, first and foremost, talking about culture because the talent war we believe will be one basically by demonstrating that this is the place to be. And as part of that, we need to be a company that's focused on sustainability, innovation and demonstrating to employees that we're going to invest and develop them. Diversification of our employee base is critical. That's why we talk a lot about our employee networks and what we're doing on inclusion and diversity. And when you put all that together, coupled with again a unique portfolio we now have focused on these dynamic ATEN and BIAF businesses with a combination of CH2M and Jacob. That's what we're focusing on to reduce attrition and increase our capability of attracting the best talent across the globe. But I want to add on to that, I made a couple of comments on innovation and technology. With our portfolio now we can actually offer more automation and tools where we can use less human capital in delivering our programs and projects for our clients and bring more innovation and technology. And so, you put all that together, we're very focused on the question that you asked and believe that we can differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Steve. See you in a couple of weeks. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi, good morning everyone. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Hi Chad. Chad Dillard : So I just wanted to dig into your comment about the second half ramp in BIAF. I just want to clarify, first of all, were you talking about bookings or revenues? And then also how much is that going to be driven by what you have in hand backlog versus new business that you need to win? And maybe you can give a little bit of color of your flavor of geography as well as specific end markets where you're seeing that incremental opportunity? Kevin Berryman : So I think it gets back to the pipeline that's currently in place which is going to augment the back half in terms of revenue growth. And so, that's certainly part of the equation, but I will say that the current backlog that we do have in place is developing in such a manner that it will provide incremental support to the back half as well. So I would say it's both. The backlog I think probably \u2013 could it happen in Q2 where it goes a little bit higher, but we\u2019re thinking it's probably more in the Q3 timetable, but that still doesn't result in the revenue starting to show some more positive trends in Q3. So I think it's both and we're excited about not only what's in backlog, but the pipeline and how that will convert as well. Steve Demetriou : Just want to add on to that. I think that also as we build this business and all the initiatives we have to continue to drive cost synergies across Jacobs with the CH2M Jacobs combination, but also some of the other initiatives like Global Business Services and some of the other initiatives across the company that the G&A as a percent of revenue improvement on the company across the rest of the year will also drive operating profit growth in the company. Chad Dillard : That's helpful. And then just given that there is still some uncertainty related to maybe another government shutdown, maybe not. I was hoping you could kind of give us a framework for thinking about, if that event actually materializes. What sort of risk would that present from like maybe operating profit per week or earnings per week perspective for the second quarter? Steve Demetriou : It's uncertain because it's tough to understand how a back-to-back government shutdown will play out, but I think the fact that this 30-day shutdown or so, we've come out of it, where essentially from our P&L standpoint neutral. And I'm really impressed with the way we were able to come through that because it demonstrates the portfolio that we talked about where we really differentiate ourselves into the most critical areas of even government businesses that where we came out neutral. Yes, there is some near-term cash crunch, but that gets resolved quickly and we've seen that this week. And last week, as the government came back up and started paying their bills. And so our goal is, first of all, we hope it doesn't happen but if it does and I think we've demonstrated through this first one that we should be able to get through it pretty clean and we're going to work on making sure that happens. Chad Dillard : Thanks, I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Wittmann from Baird. Your line is open. Andrew Wittmann : Great, thanks and good morning. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Andrew Wittmann : I guess I just have one question for today. Hey, guys. I just have one question for today. I guess the \u2013 when you announced the ECR sale, you guys suggested that the cash after closure was going to be $1.1 billion or so. Now, the number is $700 million. Certainly, I think the value of the stock, WorleyParsons stock is part of it. Kevin, can you talk about what the other factors are that lowered your cash balance expectations post closing? Kevin Berryman : Andy thanks for the question. It's not actually a reduction in our expectation. All we did is we took our pro forma debt levels at the end of our Q1 figure and just adjusted for the proceeds. The fact that our debt is a little bit higher because of the cash flow dynamics I originally alluded to. It's just rolling it forward. So we took our proceeds \u2013 our net proceeds, which have not changed and adjusted it off of our quarter-end figure. So the expectation actually is that as we continue to improve cash flow that will change over the course of time, and depending upon when the ECR deal ultimately closes, it will be probably a different number and hopefully a much larger one because we're seeing incremental cash flows associated with the work in Q2 and Q3. That makes sense? Andrew Wittmann : Got it, thank you. Yeah. Well, I mean, it feels like the stock performance has to be part of it. You have got the footnote here that is priced as of February 4th. So I mean that's not $400 million difference, but the rest of it is unchanged is what's I'm hearing from you? Kevin Berryman : Yeah, it's about $100 million effectively is the difference associated with your question. Andrew Wittmann : Yes, got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Hi, good morning everyone. Kevin Berryman : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : So on the CH2M integration as you pointed out, you are at the very high end of your integration expectations. So now having completed that type of transaction as you folks think about capital deployment opportunities from here, to what extent does that make you want to undertake larger M&A versus bolt-on within the existing segments? I'm sure we'll talk more about it at the Analyst Day, but any context you give us today would be helpful. Steve Demetriou : Look, I think the success of this integration, which was complex and is still going on and we want to maintain and actually further increase the success over this next 12 to 24 months. Now, clearly it gives us more confidence as we deploy capital and future acquisitions, small or large. And so, I think you've hit a very important point that our organic improvements in the company around transforming our core and also building the culture that I talked about coupled with now our ability to be a company that demonstrates discipline and execution around integration of M&A, including complex M&A. You put those two things together. I think we've earned the right when we see value-creating opportunities in the future and I want to emphasize value creating and discipline, where we're not eager to run out and just spend capital because we got it from ECR. It's going to be very patient and strategic use of the capital for both shareholder return as well as M&A. I think we've demonstrated the credibility to move forward in that area. So, great question. Jerry Revich : And in terms of the balance sheet, now that ECR is \u2013 will be hopefully \u2013 the transaction will be completed, you folks will have a higher margin, less cyclical business or how should we think about your target leverage ratios and in terms of getting there, let's say we're in an environment where you don't find something that's quite the right fit with leverage \u2013 increasing leverage for buyback be something that you folks would consider? Would you want to keep the dry powder in case something does come up just conceptually, how are you folks thinking about those pieces? Kevin Berryman : Jerry, I won't go into the details and actually specifically respond. But I would say that given the new portfolio that will come into play once the ECR transaction closes, affords us an ability to have higher leverage ratios. I will leave it at that. As it relates to how we will execute against that, I'll defer to our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, but certainly I would say our potential leverage ratios that are appropriate certainly aren't going down. Jerry Revich : Okay, thank you. We will look forward to it. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Your line is open. Josh Sullivan : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Josh Sullivan : A lot of activity in and around defense and space budgets. You had the nice expansion win for NASA here. Can you expand on what you're seeing in space spending or other opportunities, be it classified, defense or even on the commercial space front at this point? Steve Demetriou : As we were watching what happened with the elections late last year and how that would impact space and we're pleased that the way things ended up, we see good stability on the space side as far as NASA specifically. I think we think that there'll be continued commitment in preserving the budget there, the plus-ups maybe a little softer going forward than what we saw over the last year or two. We're also encouraged by what we're hearing about space force and our ability to participate in that. We're pretty confident in that area as well. On some of the other commercial space activities, I think that's slower to develop as we see those entities using a lot of their own resources. But as that continues to grow, we think that we're well positioned with regard to what we've been doing over the last many years with NASA and the U.S. government. Josh Sullivan : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Tahira Afzal : Hi, folks. Just a couple of questions. Number one, for the opportunities on the BIAF side, are those being driven just by the market strength or are you now starting to see a little more market share gain going forward? Steve Demetriou : Tahira, I think it's a combination of both. As I mentioned earlier, we're very encouraged on the market side. I was quoting some numbers earlier, but in the U.S. we're seeing environmental spending up 7% to 10%, and these various initiatives that have come out of these are bond measures, state counties and cities. So I won't repeat it at all, but whether it's highway, rail, water, environmental and other areas, buildings, clearly we're seeing a growing market that's driving some of the numbers. But the synergy opportunities, a lot of these major initiatives, most recently, California WaterFix and some others that I've quoted are clearly demonstrating the ability to grow market share as well. So, in short, it's a combination of both. Tahira Afzal : Got it, okay. And Kevin, maybe the next one is for you. I haven't been to the Q, but any updates on the Ichthys situation? Kevin Berryman : No, really no change from the discussions that we had previously at our year-end. We're continuing to work through that and prepare for the mediation arbitration, which is going to be happening in 2020 and we'll take it from there. Tahira Afzal : Thank you very much guys. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Steve Demetriou : All right. Look, hopefully, you feel the same way we do that there's never been a more exciting time at Jacobs. Our performance was strong, realigning our portfolio, higher growth, higher margin markets, transforming our culture at an incredible rate. I continue to be energized as I spent time with our people around the globe, pushing the envelope on possibilities, creating solutions that help drive higher performance for our clients, and while doing so enable us to create a culture that attracts and retains the best talent in the industry. We look forward to welcoming you to our Investor Day in Miami where you're going to see the Jacobs team in action. So thank you and see you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs\u2019 Fiscal Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jonathan Doros. Please go ahead. Jonathan Doros : Good morning and afternoon to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks. I would like to refer you to our Forward-Looking Statement disclosure, which is summarized on Slide 2.

We have provided historical pro forma results in the appendix of the investor presentation. We believe this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trend of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods. Now turning to Slide 3 the agenda. Steve will begin by discussing the aerospace technology and nuclear ATN line of business leadership transition we announced last week. Then move to the highlights on our cultural initiatives then provide a recap of our second quarter results, including a market review of our business. Kevin will then provide some more in depth discussion of our financial metrics then provide an update on our M&A costs and synergies as well as review our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steven Demetriou : Thank you and welcome to our fiscal year second quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin on Slides 4, I would like to discuss the aerospace technology and nuclear ATN line of business leadership transition that we announced last week. After more than 30 years of exceptional leadership at Jacobs' across multiple businesses and operations Teri Hagen, COO and president of ATN has decided to begin transitioning for retirement. Over the last several years under Tari's leadership, our ATN line of business has developed a deep - of leaders with proven execution capabilities and a roadmap for continued strong profitable growth. And while I will miss Tari's amazing leadership on top of ATN. We are in good hands with the strong set of ATN leaders across the globe. I'm very excited that Dawne Hickton has agreed to become the COO and president of ATN, replacing Teri effective June 3rd. Dawne, who stepped down last week as a director of our board to take the stake of executive positions, he is the former vice chair and CEO of RTI International. She has built numerous relationships across the aerospace industry, brings strong business acumen and has a track record of shareholder value creation. And most importantly, Dawne is an inspirational leader who fit well with our ATN organizations and government services client base. She comes to ATN with momentum. For example, Dawne was engaged in the development of our new Jacobs' strategy that was presented at Investor Day. And she was also involved in the due diligence and decision to acquire KeyW. As Dawne takes over the leadership of our global ATN business, Teri will become executive strategic advisor reporting to me. Teri will lead the KeyW integration process working closely with Dawne in the ATN leadership team. Turning the Slide 5. Our second quarter results demonstrated continued momentum toward achieving our 2019 outlook. And our first half performance is a great start for ultimately realizing our 2021 strategic targets. On a year-over-year basis, second quarter net revenues grew 9%. Operating profits increased significantly, and our adjusted EPS of $1.19 was up 37%. On April 22nd, we announced the acquisition of KeyW, a leading federal technology provider. And then on April 26th, we closed the sale of our energy, chemicals and resources business. These strategic actions represent key steps in the continuing Jacobs\u2019 transformation to provide clients solutions that are aligned to secular growth trends, such as space, urbanization, sustainability, and the convergence of information and operational technology. Also, the CH2M acquisition continues to be successfully executed and revenue synergies are now materializing in our backlog. I'm very proud of our organization\u2019s capability to drive these significant and transformative initiatives while staying focused and delivering strong second quarter financial results. We are driving a culture of innovation and accountability deep into the foundation of our Company, which will propel our success even further as our markets evolve. Now on to Slide 6 to discuss our focus on culture and specifically our talent. Jacobs\u2019 employees are our most important asset, and therefore we are relentlessly focusing on attracting, retaining and developing the world's best talent. Talent retention is a business imperative, and I have made it a personal goal to further increase our industry leading employee retention rates. We believe higher retention is a multi faceted approach that consists of top down inspirational leadership and clarity of strategy throughout the organization and inclusive and diverse workplace so all employees feel engaged and empowered and we have innovative and entrepreneurial opportunities for our employee development. Let me share two examples of our focus to create a healthy and attractive workplace. First, this week at Jacobs is Safety Week. We use Safety Week to refocus our commitment to be leaders and making health and safety a priority, both physical and mental. Throughout this week across the globe we will raise awareness of key health and safety topic, engaging our workforce, clients, contractors, family and friends by sharing information, ideas, and celebrating success. As evidenced that our diversity initiatives are gaining traction. I'm excited to share that Jacobs was recently awarded the highest designation by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for LGBTQ Equality at 100%. This is something that we are immensely proud of. We truly believe that our focus on our cultural priorities creates an environment where all employees can bring their whole self to work, enabling them to thrive, innovate and ultimately solve critical challenges for our clients. Turning to Slide 7, let's discuss another key component of our strategy innovation. At Investor Day, we outlined a strategy for accelerating innovation part of which were investments in five focused areas of Cyber security, Applied Geospatial Science, Automated Design, Internet of Things and Predictive Analytics. Our announced acquisition of KeyW directly aligns to this strategy by strengthening our capabilities in these areas. In addition, KeyW's Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance team brings new capabilities to Jacobs with proven technology relied upon by the intelligence community and associated government agencies. Now, let me recap the strategic rationale and benefits of the KeyW acquisition on Slide 8. KeyW's ISR business is leading edge and they are differentiated by their ability to deliver at a faster pace and lower cost than traditional space ISR providers. Jacobs brings the global platform and financial resources needed to materially accelerate KeyW's trajectory in the multi-billion dollar space intelligence industry. Jacobs\u2019 Enterprise IT and defensive cyber capability complemented by PW's mission IT an offensive cyber capability will enable us to offer the full spectrum of IT services. Jacobs\u2019 existing clients already recognized us as a trusted provider of solutions to their most critical problems and combined with KeyW's workforce, we will be able to translate what they do into other equally challenging environments. Whether it's new sensor and communication enhancements for smart city, geospatial or water security clients, cyber training and assessments to support our Department of Defense, Department of Energy and NASA clients or secure infrastructure technology for building an infrastructure business. We will be able to deploy enhance capabilities that benefit our current clients and springboard KeyW's growth into adjacent high value sectors. Now moving on to a review of each line of business on Slide 9 starting with aerospace technology and nuclear or ATN. During the quarter, our ATN business continued to outpace the growth of the market with 15% year-over-year revenue growth. ATN backlog continue to grow in the second quarter up 2% versus last year to $7.3 billion. As previously noted, we are approaching two major ATN rebids, the Hanford Plateau remediation contract and a confidential contract with the U.S. Government. These contracts are burning revenue without a corresponding increase in backlog. And when adjusting for the impact of these two contracts, which we expect will have favorable outcomes, backlog growth would have increased 4%. Furthermore, second quarter backlog does not include the upside from a $785 million army HTASC award which has now cleared protest and will enter our backlog in the third quarter. Also, approximately 85% of bookings during the quarter were from new business and when considering the full value of our contracts, including options and expenses, ATN's backlog would be more than 50% larger than the $7.3 billion recorded in the second quarter. As I just mentioned, during the second quarter we had the large U.S. Army HTASC win under this seven years $785 million single award IDI 2 contract. Jacobs will support the Army Training Intelligent Center of Excellence, including hands on practical performance, and simulated virtual training for the overarching training support missions of the U.S. Army. We are also continuing our work on the Patriot Excalibur Software and Systems Engineering for the U.S. Air force. This renewed five year $84 million contract provides a software solution to conduct real time operations and tracking of mission readiness. Continuing along the lines of high end government contracts, we were awarded the Department of Homeland Security Intrusion Prevention Security Services contract. This is a $31 million contract that enhances cyber security analysis, situational awareness and security response to the Department of Homeland Security. Also during the quarter, we supported the first ever salvo test of the Ground Based Midcourse Defense System involving two interceptors against an intercontinental ballistic missile conducted by the Missile Defense Agency. We provided integrated solutions to support the test in all phases launch, ground, sea and space sensors providing real time target acquisition and tracking operation of the command control battle management and communication system and finally target discrimination and ground based launching intercept. In our salvo portfolio we received an 18 month contract extension at the Department of Energy Savannah River Site. This contract is part of the environmental management portfolio where Jacobs has strong leadership. Bids have now been submitted for multiple contracts at the DOE's Hanford site. For the Hanford Central Plateau contract, where Jacobs is currently the majority JV partner we have submitted as a minority partner. If successful as a minority partner, we will only recognize our portion of a fee from the joint venture. However, on the Hanford tank farms, we bid as the majority joint venture partner, which would be a new win and add material revenue and incremental operating income. Finally, as part of our international portfolio, we are a shareholder in AWE Management Limited, which operates the Atomic Weapons Establishment, AWE in the UK. AWE has secured the next phase of the program which covers the next three years, successfully continuing the operating profit contribution to the ATN bottom line. In summary, the ATN business had outstanding performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. And looking forward, we are excited about our record highs $30 billion pipeline of new opportunities. We are focused on growing high quality operating profit with emphasis on mission critical government programs that bring resiliency to our business. We are optimistic that our strategy which combines strong technical expertise, a unique localized delivery model in an industry leading efficient cost structure will allow us to continue to gain share over time. Now turning the Slide 10, to discuss the performance of our Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities BIAF line of business. BIAF maintained a solid growth trajectory with second quarter net revenue up 5% and operating profit up 9% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by continued positive momentum across all our industry sectors and further optimization of CH2M integration synergies. North America had solid top line growth outpacing the market. In the UK despite geopolitical headwinds, we see continued capital commitments for infrastructure. And similarly in the Middle East, our business remains strong. In Australia, New Zealand we continue to experience some softness but we made solid progress against our sales forecast with key bookings across the geography. Our second quarter BIAF backlog was up 11% year-over-year to $13 billion. Backlog growth can be attributed to capitalizing on CH2M revenue synergies. Traction with our BIAF global delivery model contract extensions on several long-term engagements and large scale wins in our advanced facilities business. Operating profit margin as a percent of net revenue grew 40 basis points to 12% demonstrating our continued drive to a higher value solutions based portfolio. As we look across the BIAF industry, we see strong and steady growth in our key infrastructure sectors specifically in the life sciences and electronics. Capital spending in the U.S. Life sciences sector is increasing and electronics CapEx investments continue to be strong globally to support future demand for leading edge products. Two significant wins this quarter include a confidential vaccine manufacturing plant in the Southeast U.S. and the design of a micro processing chip manufacturing plant in the U.S. The U.S. Federal sector continues to have a promising over reporting several wins, including IDIQ contracts with the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations. In the Climate Leadership Conference in March, I was honored to accept multiple awards on behalf of Jacobs from the Environmental Business International Group for our leadership and technology environmental restoration and remediation and climate adaptation. We anticipate healthy growth by leveraging our environmental services as an enabler across all infrastructure sectors. Our transportation business continues to perform well globally. Our ports and maritime business experienced the highest growth driven by expansion of global container terminal operators in containerized bulk shipping. In aviation, we have a strong pipeline of opportunities in the U.S. as well as the rapidly expanding market in Europe and Southeast Asia. We had significant contract wins with MetroLink's Rail in Toronto and a one year contract extension for Heathrow's runway expense. Our water business remains strong with solid year-on-year growth continued recognition as a global innovation leader. We were recognized by the global water summit with various awards, including the Global Desalination Project of the Year for the two last desalination facilities in Singapore. As we mentioned at Investor Day, information technology and operational technology are converging. We believe those that can combine digital expertise and domain knowledge will takes care. An example of where we are leveraging our domain knowledge and digitally enabled solutions is a recent win for confidential clients where we are developing the cyber defense architecture for protecting their operational technology attack surface. Another key strategic win was an Artificial Intelligence Transportation Control System with Delaware Transportation Management that collects and analyzes high resolution data to disseminate real time travel information to generate traffic congestion solutions. In summary, our BIAF business continue to outpace the market, including double-digit backlog growth. We are well positioned for strong growth for the remainder of fiscal year 2019. Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you Steve. Before we view our results. Let me comment on KeyW's results which were also filed today. As you might imagine, we had the opportunity to review KeyW\u2019s preliminary March quarter results prior to signing of the acquisition agreement. We are encouraged by the progress the Company has made with key project extensions and new awards. As a result, the Company has strengthened this growth profile with backlog up over 10% year-over-year, when excluding the impact of the discontinued flight services contract. The Company reported $1.6 billion in proposal submitted and awaiting award up 23% versus the year ago quarter. We remain confident in achieving the financial outlook we outlined at announcement and are excited to welcome the KeyW team to Jacobs. Let me also comment on our pro forma adjusted figures that have been included in our appendix to this presentation. We have updated and provided results for all quarters in fiscal 2018 and 2019 on a consistent basis. We have done this to ensure clarity as to how the business is performing on a comparable basis, year-over-year. I will be referring to these figures throughout my remarks. So now I will discuss more detailed summary of our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on slide 11. Second quarter gross revenue increased 8% year-over-year with net revenue up 9%. Both ATN and BIAF contributed to the strong growth profile with ATN leading the way with a 15% increase versus a year ago quarter. Please note that we expect our second half year-over-year total net revenue growth to moderate someone. Second quarter adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 24.9% that was impacted by a higher mix of ATN revenue during the quarter, which carries as you know, a lower gross margin. Our adjusted G&A, as a percentage of net revenue was down nearly 200 basis points year-over-year, as we benefited from CH2M cost synergies and our relentless focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure. GAAP operating profit was $103 million that included $94 million of restructuring and other costs related to the acquisition of CH2M and the divestiture of ECR. $19 million of amortization from acquired in tangibles and $6 million a standard cost from our ECR divestiture to be eliminated or reimbursed through a Transition Services Agreement. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $222 million, up 27% versus a year ago periods. Our adjusted operating profits to net revenue, our new margin metric announced at a recent investor day was 9% and up 130 basis points from the Q2, 2018 figure of 7.7%. Adjusted EBITDA was $250 million or 10.2% of net revenue. GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.82 and was impacted by the after-tax per share amounts I outlined earlier about when discussing operating profit. And it was also impacted by some items below the operating income line. GAAP EPS was further impacted by $0.10 of after tax interest expense associated with debt that was paid down with the ECR sales proceeds a $0.27 cent benefit from a non-tax deferred tax adjustment related to the ECR sales and at one-time $0.18 benefits primarily associated with a settlement gain associated with the closure of CH3M Retiree Medical Plan. Excluding all of these items, including operating profit and below operating profit adjustments, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.19. This figure benefited from $0.03 due to a lower tax rate. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rates of trend down to slightly below the 25% level we had previously guided to. Finally turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was just over 1.1 times for both the trailing 12 months period and the quarter. The pipeline of opportunities across both businesses are strong and as Steve mentioned, we are beginning to see revenue synergies from CH2M materialize in our backlog. Regarding our [LOB] (Ph) performance, let's turn to Slide 12 and begin with ATN. Revenue for ATN grew 15% year-over-year. But please note that the revenue mix in the quarter had a lower associated unit profit margin associated with some of the larger enterprise contracts during the quarter. As a result, operating profit margin for the quarter was 7%. Longer term, we continue to expect operating profit margins to improve in ATN as we shift the portfolio to a higher value mix. It is important to note that our focus remains on driving operating profit growth versus revenue growth given factors that includes a structure of joint ventures, which can actually impact how revenue may or may not be reported on our P&L. We believe operating profit growth is the best indicator of performance and we continue to expect an over 10% operating profit compound annual growth rate through 2021. Moving to BIAF. The second quarter BIAF grew net revenues 5% year-over-year, and pro forma operating profit was up to 9%. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was over 12.3% for the quarter up 45 basis points on a pro forma basis from the year ago period. While we are pleased that BIAF\u2019s operating profit margin during Q2 was at the high-end of the target provided at our recent Investor Days. It's important to note that on a quarterly basis, the profitability can fluctuate depending upon the revenue mix in the quarter. Regardless, we are confident in the margin expansion for BIAF from a combination of leveraging the benefits of scale from our global model, strong project execution and higher margin opportunities currently in our pipeline. Finally, our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $25 million for the quarter, down $17 million from Q2 2018, driven by the realization of CH2M cost synergies. We continue to be focused on driving cost effectiveness into our corporate related cost structure, especially now that we have divested ECR business. Let's turn to Slide 13, where I would like to update our initiatives relative to our one-time costs, and expected synergies related to our recent transactions. As you know, the Company has undergone significant transformation over the last two years, including the $3.3 billion acquisition of CH2M and the $3.3 billion divestment of our energy, chemicals and resources business. In addition, we recently announced the pending acquisition of federal technology provider TW. All of these actions are clearly resulting in a higher margin, higher growth Company with more predictable cash flows. Let me provide an update on each starting with the CH2M integration and cost synergies. We achieved a run rate of more than 90% of expected CH2M synergies as of Q2, 2019 and continues to anticipate achieving our synergy runway target of $175 million as we exit fiscal 2019. Through Q2, we have incurred approximately $250 million of the expected $265 million in costs to achieve these synergies. We remain on track to significantly outperform our original synergy estimates. Turning to ECR. As you know the divestment of ECR closed on April 26, 2019. As a result, we received $2.6 billion in net pre-tax cash proceeds on that date. We now expect $200 million of one-time ECR related transaction, separation and restructuring costs to reflect the shift to a two line of business Company. During the quarter we incurred $40 million of these one-time costs comprised mainly of IT and labor to achieve separation. We expect all costs to be incurred by the end of the calendar year. Finally, as outlined when we announced the KeyW acquisitions, we expect to achieve $15 million of run rate cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2020 with approximately $25 million of cost to achieve those synergies. Additionally, we expect approximately $16 million of transaction fees and other one-time acquisition related costs. Now on to the cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 14. During the quarter free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding restructuring, integration and deal related costs, total over $200 million. Free cash flow substantially improved in the quarter from our Q1 figures as our focus on driving improved cash flow gain traction. Certainly part of that improvement was driven by improved DSO level. Although, there still remains more work to be done. WE remain confident that the elevated DSO figures that we saw in Q1 were a short-term issue and not related to any structural changes in our normalized levels of day sales outstanding. In fact, we continue to expect to see a reduction in DSOs for the second half of fiscal 2019. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $39 million, of which nearly $15 million was associated with non-recurring IT and real estate restructuring related to our cost synergy efforts. As a result of our improved cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $900 million and a gross debt level of $2.8 billion. On April 26th, we received 2.6 billion in pre-tax net cash and approximately $600 million of order \u2013 equity. We expect to pay approximately $500 million to $550 million in cash taxes and $200 million of transaction, separation and restructuring costs related to this transaction. As a result on an after tax and fee basis, we expect $2.5 billion in proceeds from ECR including the Worley equity stake. So looking at the right side of the chart, when accounting for the proceeds from the sale of ECR and the upcoming cash outflow related to the acquisition of KeyW. We expect Q2 pro form net debt assuming full taxes paid on ECR transaction to the approximately $400 million or well under one-time adjusted EBITDA. Regarding our accelerated share repurchase, we expect the ASR to be completed in June with the delivery of the remaining 20% of the shares of the ASR. At that time, we will evaluate further future share repurchases. And finally given us strong balance sheet and continued expectation of improved cash flow. We also announced our quarterly dividend is $0.17 per share and as you know, our dividend represents an increase of 13% versus our year ago dividend level. Now, I will turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts. Steven Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. I'm very pleased with our solid start to the first half of 2019 and the strong demand environment we are seeing within our core industry sectors. We have an ambitious strategic vision for Jacobs, a strong track record of execution and disciplined philosophy of allocating capital. The combination of which we believe is paramount to delivering above market returns for our shareholders. As we look forward, we continue to expect fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $920 million to $1 billion and we are increasing our total fiscal year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $4.45 to $4.85 per share from our previous guidance of $4.40 to $4.80. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Your line is open. Steven Demetriou : Hey Josh. Kevin Berryman : Hello Josh. You there? Operator : Go ahead Josh. Josh Sullivan : Can you hear me now? Steven Demetriou : Yes. Josh Sullivan : Just give one of your competitors successfully changed its gets code designation. You know what would be the timeline for Jacobs to potentially make a similar transition? Kevin Berryman : Well as you know, the makeup of our revenues currently are associated with the BIAF and ATN and our government services piece of that represents a smaller proportion of the of the total revenue base right now. We are in the process of further evaluating a recharacterization of some of our revenues which we know have either government services and or IT related activities, which ultimately will translate into our ability to probably near the end of this fiscal year be able to talk to S&P in order to look to try and change our next gets code longer term. And I think that is going to be a work in progress that we are going to be working on over the next six months. Josh Sullivan : Okay. Great thanks. And then just on the free cash flow and the DSOs, what do you think a normalized level including KeyW looks like and then will the new design centers in Poland and elsewhere have any impact on the DSOs positive or negative? Kevin Berryman : Ultimately, we believe that we should be receiving a conversion against net income, which translates into one-times and we think that that is the viable view of how our cash flows will be driven longer term, including KeyW. And I think the KeyW will ultimately be accretive to what we are able to do primarily because of the higher margin profile that we are expecting out of that business longer term. As it relates to let's call it our Global Business Services efforts, the more that we can get structured and disciplined as it relates to our processes, which DBS will ultimately be a big part of the better our ability to drive down the DSOs will be. So we would expect that longer term that is going to be a positive versus our ability to continue to drive improved profitability for the quarter or for the years going forward. Josh Sullivan : Great. I appreciate the color. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Lucy Guo from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Lucy Guo : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Want to say congrats to Terry on his pending retirement and I look forward to working with Don going forward. So first question is perhaps for Kevin. So you reiterated the adjusted the EBITDA guidance for FY 2019. Q1 came in at more than 25% of the year at the midpoint. Can just talked about your where you may be conservative versus if there is anything that is trending downward in the rest of the year? Kevin Berryman : Look, I think what we have done is we have included a raise to our guide $0.05, let's call that primarily are around taxes. We still feel good about the ramp up in the second quarter. And effectively, we think that our ability to drive our growth in the second half, which is substantial is still there. So I think we are just being prudent as it relates to our ability to continue to deliver against the numbers that we have provided to you. Lucy Guo : Okay, great. Second question is on KeyW, their results also came out this morning that was kind of below where the street expected. Can you just talk about, maybe into the second half of the calendar year if there is anything that is changed versus your expectations? Steven Demetriou : Good morning Lucy. We are confident in the projections that we put in place that model the acquisition including 2019. We see a timing situation going on with KeyW that some awards get pushed into the second quarter and second half of the year. We have been following it closely, we believe the second quarter is going to be a very solid quarter, there has been some good wins that they should be announcing soon. And so we are confident in the remainder of 2019. Lucy Guo : Good to hear. And finally, just wanted to see if there is any changes in the recomplete timing is just two large ones that you have highlighters, and I will pass it on. Appreciate it. Steven Demetriou : The confidential contract that we have in ATN continues to move to the right, which is good for us. We believe that there is going to be some expansion opportunity there over the near-term. And then, I mentioned, I think the other one, you are talking about a [Sanford] (Ph) we are excited, because we are actually involved in two programs there the rebate as well as the new tank farm opportunity. So, we continue to feel very positively about those and other opportunities. I think I mentioned earlier that our pipeline is a record high $30 billion in the ATN business. And then we are very excited about the pipeline and KeyW, and a margin improvement there that it\u2019s going to bring to Jacob. So all-in-all, a great pipeline going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Michael Dudas : Good morning gentlemen. Steven Demetriou : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning Michael. Michael Dudas : Steve I think in your prepare remarks you talked about how you felt with the first half of 2019, from a book of business backlog positioning standpoint, as you are trying to execute, looking at 2020 and not to get into 2020 expectations, but relative to where you were six months ago to where you finished a second quarter and taking into consideration KeyW, how better or how much more confident relative to your plan or backlog or order roll off you anticipate in each of the business for 2020? Steven Demetriou : Yes, we feel very confident about our three year ramp associated with our strategic plan that we outlined at Investor Day and we are off to a great start in the first half. When you look at some of the macros going on, we continue to feel like we are extremely well positioned. There is a lot going on, as far as budgets being set by the federal government, as well as state local. NASA remains very aggressive in their whole program of getting to the moon by 2014 and the good news is, there is a debate on how much more will be spent in NASA moving into 2020 and beyond, but the good news is, all the talk is more whether it's $1 billion to $2 billion more or something even higher than that. So, we feel good about NASA and our position there. And then when we look at Department of Defense budget, which, I think the talk is somewhere between $730 billion and $750 billion. When you peel the onion and look at the specific programs, really almost right on top of all the mission critical programs we participate in, a lot of the programs are actually being discussed as double-digit growth opportunities moving into 2020. And so, whether it's cyber or some of the other mission critical intelligence community areas that we and KeyW participate in. We feel very, very confident there. And then of course on our BIAF program, the recent news around the democrats and Trump talking about finally getting at this Federal infrastructure spending. Whether it's $1 trillion or $2 trillion, we are talking about a heck of a lot more spending opportunity in the U.S. around infrastructure. And then when you look overseas, the infrastructure opportunities are very robust. The Middle East continues to be strong for us. But even in the UK with what is going on with Brexit, the spending has been preserved, a lot of the major programs on rail and highways that we are participating in are moving forward. And we believe that once Brexit is resolved, the very first thing they are going to focus on is infrastructure to be a stimulus to the economy there. So, our second largest market in our BIAF market bodes very well. And then we continue to just be very excited about our advance facilities business. I mentioned a couple of two wins in life sciences and electronics, but we are well placed with regard to the clients that were focused on in both of those sectors and so all-in-all, I would say we just, we continue to be very confident in our three year strategic plan. Michael Dudas : Well will quit Steve and just Kevin a brief follow-up. When you talk about once KeyW's in the mix, and you look at the ATN operating profit. And you mentioned about minority chipping at some of your joint ventures majority to minority. How much of a percentage or contribution on normalized basis would those be to the overall operating profit going forward to ATN? Kevin Berryman : I don't have that. It really kind of depends on what the win profile looks like. But obviously if in fact, we go from the prime to a sub on the JV or something like that. Managing partner versus not, you are going to effectively see - all you are going to see in our financials is the fee that we are earnings as it relates to that. So obviously it will be a big number in terms of profitability with no revenue. The numbers probably are not exactly hugely material in terms of numbers, but it will be accretive and certainly we can get that information back to you after the fact when we start to get a better sense of how it's going to play out. Michael Dudas : Excellent. Thank you gentlemen. Operator : Your next question will come from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of clarifications on the guidance. Kevin, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about revenue growth or the top-line in the back half sort of moderating. Can you just talk about the drivers behind that or just get a little more specific in particular with restating things year-over-year? And then my second question is, obviously, this changes with KeyW, but the operating margins and ATN. How you are thinking about that in the back half as well? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Yes. I think, clearly, Jamie. As it relates to the back half moderation comment, it's really more about the fact that the comparables for ATN specifically continue to expand and grow last year in the back half as the ramp up on the large enterprise contracts occurred. So the comparables in the back half of 2018 are strong, stronger than what the first half was. So we are just comparing to a bigger part of those ramp ups that actually haven\u2019t occurred. So that is probably the biggest piece of the ramp down. I think that or the moderation down. I think the other point as it relates to margin profile. As we think about going forward, certainly the ATN business has an expectation level that we are going to be improving margin consistent with the strategic plan that we outlined relative to the Investor Day, and we would expect to see part of that occurring in 2019 back half as well. Relative to KeyW, it depends on really when it closes, and to the extent it does close, with enough time to really have an impact in the back half, we would expect to see accretion relative to that as well. But it will be pretty immaterial given where we are in the year and when the when the close might occur. Some potential limited benefit in fourth quarter, but it really depends on when the deal closes. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thank you. I will get back in queue. Operator : Next question will come from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steven Demetriou : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Hi Jerry. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if we just flush out in BIAF, really short bookings this quarter, can you give us a sense for how much of the growth was in water versus transportation? So what part of the portfolio are you seeing backlog growing? And, related question the $2 billion plus CH2M, revenue synergy pipeline, how much contribution are you expecting over the next call it 12 to 18 months? How much have we already seen flow through the results? Can you just touch more granularity on that part of the opportunities that plays? Steven Demetriou : Good, thanks, Jerry. It's been for BIAF pretty much across the board. We, we have seen it both in the B&I side as well as the advanced facility side. When we look at our business, we are ramping up some major water programs that we have announced out in California and Houston and some others that clearly we attribute to the combination of Jacobs in and CH2M. We had a major highway win in the Washington DC area that was something that we don't believe either Company would have won on its own together. And the other story on that Jerry is that it's margin improvement as well. Whereas both companies in the past would have partnered with others including each other and would have had to share the margin. As an integrated Company now, you know, we are getting more of the pie, as we are winning rail or highway or airport or water, environmental solutions wins, because of the fact that we can bring now most everything we need other than having to team up from time-to-time with small, set aside business partners. So, just can't overemphasize, it's across the board. The advanced facilities was a major contributor this quarter and as they are ramping up, programs both in the electronics and the life sciences area. And it's and it's been global across the globe, but really the only soft point that is in the Australia, New Zealand area after several great years there. So, we really like what we are seeing across the globe in all sectors. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then coming back to your comment about sales growth moderating in the back half because of the tough consummate in ATN. On the flip side, you have really strong bookings momentum in BIAF and where the organic growth is generally year-to-date been call it towards the midpoint of your long-term targets, and it feels like you have got better bookings momentum, at least near-term. Can you address to what your expectations are for BIAF or organic growth, is that any comps that we need to be aware of? Kevin Berryman : Look, I think, if we were to characterize the growth outlook for both of the businesses, ATN while we still like the growth. BIAF has the stronger kind of near-term momentum over the back half of the year, because they are not facing some of the ramp ups that ATN had in back half of last year. So year-over-year is certainly going to be stronger for BIAF in the back half than ATN. And I would say that, we feel good about those bookings and how they come into the mix. I think it's very clear, with the backlog being $1.3 billion in BIAF. At the end of the quarter clearly that is indicating some stronger near-term opportunities in terms of the burn in the back half. So certainly stronger in BIAF more muted in ATN, but still we feel pretty good about the back half in terms of the revenue growth but moderating a tab. Jerry Revich : Okay. And let me add my congratulations to Teri as well, quite a contribution to the business Teri and Dawn welcome and we are looking forward to working with you. Thanks, everyone. Steven Demetriou : Thanks Jerry. Kevin Berryman : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Tahira Afzal : Hi, folks, congratulations on a good quarter. Steven Demetriou : Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Thank you. Tahira Afzal : I guess first question, and I hate to beat the ATN horse again. Kevin, but I'm looking at your 2% to 3% CAGR guidance and even if I assume a massive fade for the rest of the year, it seems it\u2019s tough to build my CAGR even at the upper end of that as and I'm well exceeding that. Unless I assume that your revenues in ATN are flat or even was pretty out a year. So I assume that is conservatism on your part and to the extent it is and the read actions would be higher, how does that impact or benefit your margins? Kevin Berryman : So for the ATN guide, we haven\u2019t really given specific guidance first point and as it relates to our revenue for ATN at a good quarter, obviously this quarter. And consequently, I think that the back half is still going to be showing some growth. And perhaps, what you are talking about is the guide previous to this quarter. So I think effectively we will see incremental revenue versus what we had been thinking last quarter. I will say the margin profile was a little bit less strong, given the mix of the profile. And consequently, we saw a little bit lower profitability margin associated with that relative to the dynamic. But I think 2019 is shaping up to be a pretty good pretty good look for ATN in terms of revenue and BIAF. So if you are talking about the longer term guide in the Investor Day, clearly that plays into the whole dynamic relative to joint ventures and how that may or may not play into the profile and there is a big chunk that if we do our strategy, which has been to participate is not the general partner in some of the JV work. That will ultimately affect our reported growth profile and that is one of the reasons for that guidance. Tahira Afzal : Got it, okay. And Kevin, I recall you guys bought a communications-oriented business a while back, maybe a Verizon piece. Can you leverage that towards a lot of the satellite work or the lower newer work you might be doing once KeyW gets going? Kevin Berryman : Yes I think the - you are talking about the FNS acquisition, which was four or five years ago, maybe. So, yes. Look I think that certainly was one of the initial stages of the transformation of the ATN organization in terms of getting into that business with certainly being very high technology oriented and work associated with managing telecommunications for some of the three letter agencies in the U.S. Government. So clearly, a high technology play, and we have been very, very excited and happy with that deal. I think ultimately, the KeyW - while I think there is opportunities in ATN to further leverage those capabilities. I would say we are actually excited about the opportunity associated with BIAF as well, because of the [sensoring] (Ph) capabilities to bring some of that technology into play in terms of the portfolio of BIAF longer term. So, yes, I think there is some opportunities in ATN and we think there is good - we talked about there being strong revenue synergies, which were not included in our analysis on the KeyW acquisition, but they don't only exist in ATN, they also exist in BIAF well. Tahira Afzal : Got it. Thank you Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [indiscernible] behalf of Andy. Steven Demetriou : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Can you give us some color on what is underpinning the continued strength in Middle East infrastructure that we just reference. Given that we have seen some more mix trend in other industrial end-markets in the region? Steven Demetriou : I think, it's in different areas. We are doing a lot of work in places like Abu Dhabi and Dubai and there is things going on with the Expo, there is major rail expansions, there is economic growth that is driving the need for new infrastructure, you have got Saudi Arabia with the 2030 vision. And just a real relentless pursuit of expanding everything from health care to entertainment to smart cities. And so, I can't compare it to what is going on in other areas, but if I do look at Saudi, for example, it's a diversification and it's now spreading its funding, which in the past has been exclusively around the energy and chemical refining sector to areas around infrastructure is a good example. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you that is helpful. And my follow-up would be with ECR sale complete and given that you noted that CH2M integration is there complete. Can you talk about how you think about the face off potential incremental M&A activity going forward? Should we expect some pause coming into the activities till you close out the KeyW or should we see more bolt-on acquisitions? Steven Demetriou : Well, I think we still have a tremendous runway of opportunity to maximize the integration and synergies of CH2M especially with our BIAF business. I expect that from time-to-time we will have some bolt-on opportunities to take that combination of BIAF\u2019s Jacobs and CH2M capability and bring some additional capabilities, talked about at Investor Day digital consulting is an area that we are interested in and there could be on a bolt on opportunities. ATN, I think you know, where the KeyW was a an initial step of our strategy to really become a tier one government services player especially focused around areas like federal it and you know the intelligence community and those priority areas for us. And so I would expect over the next several years from time-to-time, some bolt on opportunities. But, we are very mindful and balanced around our capital deployment. We still believe Jacobs is a great investment and, we have launched our first step with the ASR and we laid out the fact that we expect to not only continue our dividend, but increase it as our earnings increase. So, we believe a good disciplined patient capital deployment strategy. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Just a competitive question around ATN. I know you expect to pursue and win higher margin contracts in ATN. I guess to what extent are you guys seeing a convergence of bidders on a relatively narrow batch of higher margin attractive, technologically driven contracts? Or is the overall pie of higher margin contracts just getting bigger? I'm sure. everyone wants to pursue higher margin work. Are there more opportunities for everyone or is there a convergence on sort of a select set? Steven Demetriou : Well, we have talked about the fact that ATN, unlike most of our other markets is very highly fragmented. And we still have a relatively small share of the whole big pie there when we talked about just in the U.S. market. And So, you know we see our ability because of our differentiated models that we talked about around our ability to tailor our offerings to our clients rather than some of our competitors bringing sort of their overhead structure to the clients and to work in a in a swift basis. And I think KeyW is only going to get us even at a higher level there with their rapid deployment that is been the proven differentiation. And so, we look at it less around how much are we all going after the same thing versus our ability to bring unique offerings? Our wind tunnel business, for example, in ATN, we bring a unique technology there that enables us to come in good solid margins and win more than our fair share of business there. And our ability now to work with our clients around 5G deployment is a very positive area, cyber security and what we have done now with KeyW to strengthen our cyber security platform is only going to make us stronger there. And we are excited again with KeyW Jacobs around analytics capabilities, artificial intelligence, machine learning and what we are going to be able to do. And I mentioned that some of the specific focal areas by the Department of Defense are really in these high margin differentiated areas where we bring unique capability. So all-in-all, we feel confident in our ability to not only win more than our fair share, but to focus on the best value sectors in our ATN industry. Kevin Berryman : There is another comment to make to relative to the strategies that ATN team has developed, and it's really relative to some of the contracting strategies and they really are looking because of their very strong position on cost profile and in capabilities, which Steve has just outlined. There is an ability for the team to be doing fixed price services work, which is low risk, but ultimately allows for margin enhancement and Teri outlined that as part of Investor Day, and I think that that continues to be an opportunity for the team in ATN to continue to drive that business. And so not only do we have the opportunity on the enterprise contracts, the larger ones, which sometimes can be a little bit more challenging from a margin perspective, there is a very specific focus on the other side, which is some of the smaller, more fixed price services which really don't have risk that is any different than some of the other jobs that we do or projects that we do And consequently that is a screen part of the strategy and already is part of the strategy that is being executed by the ATN team. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi, good morning everyone. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Chad Dillard : So I just want to dig into the ATN procurement cycle. So I just want to understand from where we are today - continue growing backlog through the balance of the year. And then a little bit longer term relative to the $30 billion pipeline. Can you just talk about the balance of small projects driving potential ones versus larger ones that you mentioned that Hanford was one potential, but is here anything beyond that? Steven Demetriou : Again, it's such a broad based answer, so I will try to be succinct around it. But, I will just start with NASA. A lot of the ability to grow in NASA starts with performance. And we have had great outcomes recently on our award scores. And so when we looked at NASA being aggressive on going after their programs and we see an increasing budget, we clearly see ramp up at NASA, across the board there. I mentioned automotive where we have unique capabilities and a very high value wind tunnel, commercial automotive business. We have been very strong in the U.S., we are expanding into Europe, with a lot of the automotive players there as fuel efficiency and acoustics and some of the other areas that the automotive industry was focusing on. Missile defense, that program is going great for us and we are finding opportunities to grow. We see that continuing to ramp up. And then when we look at, as I mentioned earlier cyber security that is an area now that where this whole IT OT convergence really excited to see the clients lock in now to see Jacobs as a major player there and the KeyW acquisition only further increased our brand and awareness there for penetrating that business. So it's pretty widespread and then internationally in the UK, we are in also Europe, we are focused there are some initiatives we are working on to get bigger outside of the U.S. on ATN into some adjacent markets. And then the opportunity is, as I mentioned earlier, this ability to take what we are doing in ATN and BIAF together and looking at opportunities, whether it's smart cities or the 5G rollout or, other opportunities to bring our domain, knowledge and capability that we have established in buildings, infrastructure, advanced facilities, and bring the ATN capabilities to those markets. So, there is a tremendous opportunity that is driving that $30 billion pipeline that we mentioned earlier. Kevin Berryman : I think it's important to augment or reinforce Steve\u2019s comments that he also made during the prepared remarks, which talks about kind of this is a government services business that we have and everyone talks about DoD and what the total increase is. But if you peel away the onion, and you look at what we do for the DoD and NASA and other agencies. The increases are not the kind of single-digit numbers that everyone is talking about, it's more in line with double-digit increases in 2020 for the Federal Government business. That still got to be worked through, but clearly indications are where we do our work. We are talking more in line with double-digit increases in spend for the government in the 2020 budget. So it obviously, on top of what Steve has talked about in terms of capability sets a foundational element of there being a general boat that is floating a little bit higher in the water. Chad Dillard : Great. That is helpful. And just a question here. How should we think about the cash conversion for the business structure for the balance of the year? Kevin Berryman : Well we think that clearly, we saw an improvement in Q2, that was important to do, given what we saw in Q1. Q3 and Q4 tend to be strong cash flow periods for us. So I would think that we should be seeing an improvement, it's ultimately going to be driven by the ability for us to deliver against the DSO expectations that we have for ourselves, we got to continue to drive that down over the second half of the year. And I make these comments, X I would say some of the restructuring one-time cost that we are continuing to execute through given the issues associated with our myriad of transition opportunities, transformation opportunities on ECR, on CH and what will begin to happen which is KeyW. So we feel pretty good about the second half cash flow in the back half and like I said, not sure we will get to the one-times conversion for the for the full year this year. But we certainly believe that that is going to be the expectation for this portfolio and we should expect that going forward longer term as we communicated at our Investor Day. Chad Dillard : Thanks. I will pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Justin Hauke : Yes. Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to maybe get one more clarification on the big ATN contracts that you have. You have got the two recompetes that are outstanding and then you have got the Hanford tender that you submitted. So is the timing for the award decision on all of those the same September of this year and just in terms of relative scope, how big are the recompete versus the incremental opportunity at Hanford, just so we can think about how those go? What it might be? Steven Demetriou : Yes. The Hanford one is both of them should play out around the same time and it will be later this fiscal year. Whereas the confidential contract is more moving into 2020 timeframe. So, those are not overlapping and what we are excited about is and especially when we look at about the $30 billion pipeline, the majority of that is new business and it's not extensions or rebid, although, they will be from time-to-time. But we are really expanding into when you look at the wins that have moved the needle for ATN over the last 12 to 18 months, whether it was the Special Ops Command or missile defense, as an example. Look, we moved into new areas there the KeyW acquisition is only going to accelerate that now when we talk now about getting into ISR space and being able to take their capabilities and move them into our water business or sustainable solutions or agricultural solutions. When we talked about this whole IT, OT convergence that is moving into new areas. So I think we are well balanced when it comes to contracts extensions or rebids in new business. Justin Hauke : Okay, and then I guess my second question here is just on the DSOs. Kevin, I appreciate your comments on that. But the unbilled was up fairly significantly quarter-to-quarter $230 million or so. I know last quarter there was issues with collections on the Federal Government. But is that still tied to that or is that you know - the federal billings have those been billed is $230 million still on that or is it something else? Kevin Berryman : No look I think if we track both of these metrics obviously and then net against that the billings in excess which is pre payments that our customers have made, which is how we track our DSO figures. So we did see some of those challenges let's call it at the beginning of the quarter, but not so at the at the end of the quarter, because of the ability for the government to get back on track as it relates to the shutdown that we had there for a bid. So, look, I think there is a lot of moving pieces in terms of our system environment and implementations, which will create some volatility in those numbers in the short-term. Remember that we have gone to on the CH2M integration we effectively at the beginning of the year went to 80% of the CH2M business. Roughly plus or minus went on to the Jacobs system environment, that we are still working through the adjustments and necessary improvements as it relates to that go live in anticipation for the next 20% going live, which is probably at the end of our third quarter, which is coming up here shortly. And, and so there are some kind of moving pieces right now. We are expecting that at the end of the day, all of this is going to translate into lower DSOs is going forward we have to, because we saw the tweak up in Q1 to the levels that we believe we need to get down quickly. Justin Hauke : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the conference back over to our presenters. Steven Demetriou : Thank you. So as I reflect on our second quarter results we are immensely proud of our organizations. We are performing at a high level during a period of extraordinary transformation, where we are focusing and progressing the integration of CH2M successfully. We are executing on our three year strategy which we laid out on that Investor Day. We made an important acquisition with KeyW and the government services sector and obviously, completing the transformational divestiture of the ECR and separating that from Jacobs. And concurrent with all of these activities, people are focused delivering exceptional results. So the bottom line is we have extraordinary people delivering extraordinary outcomes. And I hope you are as excited as I am about our growth here at Jacobs. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Steven Demetriou : Thank you. Turning to Slide 4. Thank you for joining today to discuss our fiscal year third quarter financial results and the progress we are making on executing against the strategy we outlined at our February 2019 Investor Day.As you\u2019ve heard us say, we at Jacobs are on a journey to create a company like no other. Over the last few years, we have successfully implemented multiple organic and inorganic strategic portfolio actions to transform Jacobs. We are now predominantly aligned to multiple secular growth trends, such as space, urbanization, resiliency, and the convergence of information and operational technology.Furthermore, our relentless focus on culture, improving track record of execution discipline creates an unmatched global network of expertise, which provides the ability to deliver innovative solutions for our clients\u2019 complex challenges.As a result of this competitive advantage, we expect Jacobs to exceed the growth trends of our markets over the long-term. Our leadership position was recently recognized by once again achieving the number one global design firm ranking by PNR including Jacobs being the top-ranked firm in 19 critical sub-markets.Our fiscal year third quarter results demonstrate a continued focused execution through one of the most transformative periods in our company history.During the quarter, we entered the final stages of the highly successful CH2M integration while closing the sale of our energy, chemicals and resources business and completing the acquisition of KeyW, a leading provider of space intelligence, cyber and data-driven technology solutions.On a year-over-year basis, third quarter net revenue organically grew by 11%. Operating profit increased and adjusted earnings per share of $1.40 was up 13% and when excluding discrete tax benefits in the current and year ago quarter, EPS was up 8%. During the quarter, we also completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase and as of August 2, we\u2019ve repurchased an additional $100 million of shares on the open market.Since announcing the $1 billion share repurchase authorization, we have retired $350 million of shares in just five months at significant discount to our estimated intrinsic value. We have a healthy balance sheet that provides the capacity to continue to repurchase shares and further deploy capital towards other higher return investments.Given our strong operating and financial performance, as well as our ownership of KeyW, we are raising our total year 2019 adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share outlook and we continue to be well positioned to realize our 2021 shareholder return objectives.Now on to Slide 5 to discuss our focus on culture and specifically our goal to be the employer of choice. Becoming a company like no other includes reimagining approaches to inclusion and diversity that transform the future of Jacobs. Our strong culture of caring celebrates diverse perspectives, unique backgrounds and individual experiences and we at Jacobs firmly believe that our committed and systematic approach to inclusion and diversity supports an environment where employees will thrive. It enhances the richness of our client offerings and it\u2019s critical to achieving our strategic and financial commitments.As part of this journey, in June we held a very inspiring Jacobs Women\u2019s Network Global Summit. The theme of which was empowering women and engaging men. This continued our focus on ensuring gender quality, as well as accelerating the advancement of women at Jacobs. The women\u2019s summit also served as think tank for innovation along with unlocking new business development opportunities across Jacobs.And I am very pleased with the measurable progress we are making with 45% of our Board of Directors now made up of diverse directors and 75% of the Jacobs executive leadership team represented by diverse executives. We have positively transformed inclusivity at the top levels of Jacobs. We remain committed to achieve similar levels of diversity across all of Jacobs which we believe will enable us to continue to outperform as a company.Turning to Slide 6, let\u2019s dive into another key pillar of our strategy, innovation and an example of how we are uniquely positioned to solve complex challenges. At our Investor Day, we discussed our competitive edge for leading in the convergence of information and operational technology and our advantage combines deep domain knowledge with leading technology expertise.This strategy includes dedicated investments in five technology hubs of cyber security, applied geospatial science, automated design, internet of things and predictive analytics. I\u2019d like to share a recent example of how we are implementing this strategy. One of today\u2019s global environmental threats is the impact of Synthetic Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, PFAS in our water and soil.The pervasiveness of these synthetic compounds in our world, the difficulty in removing them from the environment and the toxological risks create a complex and time-critical challenge for our planet. Our Jacobs emerging contaminants practice is harnessing our company\u2019s integrated domain expertise and environmental investigation, remediation, water treatment and infrastructure design to partner with leading academics, industry work groups and our clients to tackle this challenge now and into the future.Jacobs has performed evaluations of thousands of possible release locations, collecting data and information from industrial sites to military installations to aviation facilities. We are using our experience and knowledge to continually improve our understanding of both the physical and toxological behavior of these compounds to better characterize their presence, predict the migration and identify ways to remediate these compounds in both soil and water.Jacobs\u2019 unique ability to bring together our science and engineering domain expertise, while also leveraging our technological depth and geospatial science and analytics provides us an ideal opportunity to develop solutions for our clients.One of our large confidential U.S. customers we are providing data analytics and visualization solutions to deliver actionable intelligence to help this customer understand and prioritize their approach to PFAS remediation plans. A key component of this win was applying next-generation data science with our domain knowledge against petabytes of desperate data.Other legacy consultants without this deep domain knowledge would not have the ability to filter out the noise and drive this true accuracy and results. Investigation and remediation of PFAS in the U.S. alone is measured in the billions of dollars and our team is well positioned to help in this recovery for our communities.Now moving to Slide 7. Our acquisition of KeyW, a leading space intelligence and cyber solutions provider closed on June 12. We are off to a great start with the integration and we are on track to achieve the targeted cost synergies and most importantly, we are gaining early alignment for considerable revenue synergies. As we previously outlined, KeyW has multiple high value offerings whose growth can be accelerated when leveraging our global platform and financial resources.Let me update you on three specific areas. First in the area of space intelligence. KeyW\u2019s confidential breakthrough space intelligence initiatives continues to move forward and is well funded and importantly, internal testing continues to be positive. And the follow-on space intelligence pipeline remains robust as the U.S. Department of Defense focuses on future use of cost-efficient low orbit satellites.Secondly, in Mission IT, the pipeline is growing with numerous $100 million plus pursuits. In addition, we see significant opportunities to cross-sell KeyW and Jacobs capabilities into existing contract vehicles and sales pursuits.And thirdly, our combined cyber capabilities will now form the basis for a new robust global cyber business unit within our ATN line of business. This organizational move allows us to focus key leadership and resources on the rapidly growing global cyber security sector. We\u2019ve already identified specific revenue synergy opportunities that will allow the pursuit of large long-term intelligence community cyber programs.And now moving on to Slide 8 for a review of our aerospace technology and nuclear ATN line of business. ATN\u2019s total backlog including the benefit from KeyW reached $8.5 billion by the end of the third quarter. Excluding KeyW, ATN\u2019s backlog was up 4% versus last year. As previously noted, we are approaching two significant ATN rebids, the Hanford Plateau Remediation contract and a classified network security contract with the U.S. government.These contracts are burning revenue without a corresponding increase in backlog. When taking into account these two contracts, which we expect will have favorable outcomes, backlog growth would have increased by high-single-digits versus last year.Approximately, 75% of ATN bookings during the quarter were from new business. When considering the full value of our multi-year contracts, ATN\u2019s total backlog is more than 40% larger than our reported backlog. From a strategic standpoint, through purposeful actions, portfolio actions and a track record of high-quality consistent project execution, our ATN model uniquely combines strong technical expertise with localized delivery and an industry-leading efficient cost structure.This model has proven our ability to scale in core sectors and expand into complementary high value adjacent sectors both organically and through acquisitions. As an example, during the third quarter, we leveraged our strong path to execution performance with the Australian Department of Defense to be awarded a contract as sole provider for the joint strike fighter system support services.Jacobs will provide engineering and other technical services, to the Australian New Combat Capability Project Office, which is acquiring the F35 joint strike fighter for the Royal Australian Air force. The award reflects the successful long-term relationship Jacobs has built with this client. Another example of strong project execution is our Telecom Services business which is benefiting from the build out of 5G infrastructure, a significant growth opportunity.Our team has strategically expanded into higher value areas of Telecom Services and is successfully increasing Jacobs\u2019 footprint across the U.S. to respond to this opportunity. We expect our telecom business to drive additional operating profit growth as we take these capabilities globally and we\u2019ll also cross-sell these services in our Buildings and Infrastructure smart city initiatives.The KeyW acquisition is our latest move in expanding our government services capabilities and higher value, higher margin work by acquiring strong technical expertise with the intent to leverage our delivery model and cost structure to accelerate growth. We\u2019ve proven the effectiveness of this model with the previous acquisitions of cyber security companies Blue Canopy and Van Dyke through an increased win rate as demonstrated by recent large awards with Missile Defense and Special Operations Command.During the KeyW was awarded two five year task orders with a combined revenue of more than $150 million for the U.S. Army to provide knowledge management solutions and software engineering support for strategic satellite communications. These awards demonstrate KeyW\u2019s highly sought after technology expertise and top priority satellite programs.More importantly, we are pursuing multiple large opportunities in fiscal 2020 and 2021, where we can leverage KeyW\u2019s leading technical expertise for Mission IT and cyber. Intelligent asset management is another ATN organic adjacent opportunity that we discussed at our Investor Day and one where we continue to make great progress.We\u2019ve developed an attractive offering through the use of next-generation technology that lowers the runrate cost to our customers. While we are currently delivering intelligent asset solutions for the U.S. Navy in Mayport, NASA Langley and NASA AMES, there are $1.5 billion of additional intelligent asset management opportunities in our pipeline with other customers.Outside of the government arena, another highly technical third quarter win comes from our successful rebid of the win share program. Under the $72 million contract extension, we deliver test operations in support of NASCAR and other high-performance automotive organizations.In summary, we are very pleased with the ATN performance in fiscal 2019 and as we look forward, our pipeline has now increased to well over $30 billion in opportunities. Our strategy of leveraging our unique model to scale in core government services markets, while expanding selectively and complementary high value sectors and geographies is on track to drive double-digit operating profit growth.We will now turn to Slide 9 to discuss our Buildings Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities BIAF line of business. BIAF continued its solid performance from the first half of the year with third quarter backlog up 10% year-over-year to $14 billion. Our sales pipeline is also strengthening, up 15% year-over-year with a strong contribution from most geographies across the globe.In line with our strategy around market connectivity, Jacobs continues to build deep domain and technological expertise in high value areas positioning us to capitalize on the convergence of end-markets in digital requirements and infrastructure. We are pleased with the second year in a row, Jacobs was ranked as the number one global design firm by ENR and we also retained our number one ranking in several of our high growth sectors including water, airports, advanced manufacturing and government buildings.Adding to that, we moved up to the number one ranking in mass transit and rail and maritime and ports. These rankings signify the differentiated thought leadership of our global solutions and technology team and our strong BIAF project and program execution positioning Jacobs for long-term and sustainable, competitive differentiation.From a geographic standpoint, North America continues the momentum of strong growth, notably in water, environmental, transportation and advanced facilities. Our UK business has delivered steadily despite Brexit headwinds. Australia and New Zealand rebounded in the third quarter with key bookings in water, transportation and healthcare sectors. And the Middle East and Asia remains strong with a growing pipeline of opportunities.Now let\u2019s look at our key infrastructure industry sectors by solution. In the Water and Environmental sectors, infrastructure resiliency poses a multi-decade challenge to our communities driven by more extreme weather events and population growth that are attaching our current infrastructure. This is an area where Jacobs continues to demonstrate global leadership.For example, we delivered solutions for FEMA to remediate recent floods of Nebraska and we are helping major cities in India contend with drought conditions. Additionally, we are on the front-end of next-generation water technology. We are partnering with PUB, Singapore\u2019s National Water Agency to deliver automated metering solutions which will increase the efficiency of their water infrastructure.We believe this automated metering model will be the reference architecture of the next-generation water solutions and one of our competitive advantages is our ability to transport global experience to deliver knowledge and execution locally.Another near-term BIAF growth driver are opportunities related to U.S. Department of Defense Overseas Infrastructure, especially, in Asia and Eastern Europe regions. These projects are well funded in the current and future budgets. Transportation spending remains strong globally with specific strength in rail and aviation. We are seeing an influx of large-scale projects in our pipeline that require the understanding of market convergence and the productivity benefits from the ability to execute with a global delivery model.As an example, these requirements were a differentiator in our recent win in Melbourne, Australia, performing design services for the Mordialloc Bypass and will provide us an advantage converting multiple pipeline opportunities. And our advanced facilities sectors remain maintain a very steady CapEx spend throughout the quarter, particularly among the leading life sciences and electronics manufacturers where Jacobs is well positioned.During the quarter, we had two significant wins in the U.S. with repeat customers for a gene therapy facility and a microprocessing client. Our advanced facilities customers have chosen to partner with Jacobs as we are the one of the only providers that has the expertise, scale and execution track record to match their accelerated time requirements for introducing new technologies to their customers.In summary, BIAF posted solid performance this quarter leveraging key strategy elements of market convergence and the benefits of scale, taking shape through our global delivery model. We are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2019 and on track to achieve our 2021 targets.Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Steve. Before we view our results, I would like to remind everyone that recast pro forma adjusted figures have been included in the appendices to this presentation. We have updated and provided results for all quarters in fiscal 2018 and 2019 on a consistent basis from the time they were provided in the second quarter.We provide this updated, historical disclosure to ensure clarity since the health of business is performing on a comparable basis year-over-year. I will be referring to these figures throughout my remarks.So now I will discuss a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 on Slide 10. Third quarter gross revenue increased 8% year-over-year with net revenue on an organic basis excluding the KeyW stub period up 11% Both ATN and BIAF equally contributed to this strong double-digit top-line growth.Third quarter adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net revenue were 23.9% mainly impacted by two items, one, a higher mix of ATN procurement activity, and reimbursable versus fixed price revenue and two, a mix impact from a true-up of cost of BIAF and for the final stages of a large advanced facilities project.Our adjusted G&A, as a percentage of net revenue fell by 90 basis points year-over-year to 15% from the pro forma figures in the third quarter of 2018 indicating continued strong cost control and synergy delivery. The current quarter benefited from the realization of CH2M synergies despite facing a year-over-year headwind from our fringe true-up that we realized in the third quarter 2018.GAAP operating profit was $90 million and included $92 million of restructuring and other charges, $13 million of transaction cost and prudent connection with the closing of the KeyW acquisition and $38 million of other adjustments consisting mainly of, $80 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, $17 million of cost associated with the Worley Transition Services agreement, of which, $14 million of cost will reimburse and reported in other income and $3 million of stranded cost and other.Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $233 million, up 4% from the prior year performance period and including $2 million of operating profit from the KeyW stub period.Let me provide a bit more color on the accounting treatment related to our transition service agreement or TSA with Worley related to the sale of our ECR business. From a GAAP standpoint, the cost of the TSA services provided to Worley are reflected in our SG&A line. But the reimbursement of those costs from Worley are reported in other income below operating profit.As a result, this accounting treatment understates the true operating profit associated with the TSA effort as these costs are being incurred specifically to support the services provided to Worley.Moving on and including adjustments for the items just noted, our adjusted operating profits and net revenue was 8.8%, down year-over-year due to the revenue mix headwind I previously stated and a tougher comparison related to the aforementioned fringe true-up in the year ago quarter.On a year-to-date basis, adjusted operating profit was $640 million, up 20% and operating profit margins are 8.5%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. We have clearly made strong initial progress against our strategic target objective of 125 to 175 basis points of margin expansion by the year 2021.Also for the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $259 million or 10% of net revenue and is now $710 million on a year-to-date basis, up 18% year-over-year. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $89 million and $0.65 per share impacted mainly by, $0.51 per share of after-tax restructuring and other charges, $0.07 per share of after-tax transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the KeyW acquisition and $0.17 per share of other adjustments consisting mainly of intangible amortization of $0.10 and pro forma interest expense adjustment of $0.03.Additional reconciliation details can be found in the press release and in the appendix of this investor presentation. So excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.40, operating profit from the stub period was effectively offset by the incremental interest expense associated with the transaction.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 times for Q3 and 1.1 times on a trailing 12-month period. KeyW\u2019s Q3 book-to-bill was just over one times. The pipeline of opportunities across all of our businesses remains quite strong and as Steve mentioned, we are seeing revenue synergies accelerated in our pipeline for both CH2M and KeyW.Regarding our LOB performance, I\u2019ll turn to Slide 11 starting with ATN, revenue grew 11% year-over-year excluding the stub period revenue from KeyW. In line with last quarter, the revenue mix in the quarter had a lower associated unit profit margin associated with higher revenue from large reimbursable enterprise contracts, and higher revenues associated with procurement activities within large contracts resulting in an operating profit margin for the quarter at 6.6%.Importantly, these contracts remain highly attractive from a total return basis as they are from multi-year visibility, lower risk and minimal working capital investment. On a year-to-date basis, operating profit is up 19% and is 6.8% of revenue indicative of the strong performance of the business over the first three quarters of the year.Moving into fiscal 2020, we continue to expect operating profit margins to improve in ATN as we shift the portfolio to a higher value mix, including more fixed price services contract and a higher contribution from the recently acquired KeyW organization.It is important to note that our focus in ATN remains on driving operating profit growth given factors that includes the structure of joint ventures, which can impact how revenue may or may not be reported on our P&L which could impact headline margin percentages.Given these factors in the ATN business, we believe operating profit growth is the best indicator of performance and we continue to expect an operating profit compound annual growth rate through 2021 of over 10%.Regarding KeyW, their June results came in line with our expectations and we are encouraged by the progress our joint teams are making building a maturing pipeline opportunities. Backlog was up over 11% year-over-year when excluding the impact of the discontinued flight services contract and we remain confident in achieving the financial outlook we outlined that announcement.Moving to BIAF, in the quarter BIAF grew net revenue of 11% year-over-year, and operating profit was up 3%. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 12.4% for the quarter, up 30 basis points from fiscal 2018 and faced a headwind from the revenue mix previously mentioned. On a year-to-date basis, operating profit is up 11% year-over-year and 12.1% of net revenue, a clear indication of the momentum of the business.We expect continued improvement in the fourth quarter toward achieving our fiscal 2021 margin target. This improvement will be driven by a combination of leveraging the benefits of scale from our global model, strong project execution and higher margin opportunities currently in our pipeline.Our non-allocated corporate overhead cost were $27 million for the quarter, slightly higher sequentially and year-over-year. As previously mentioned, we benefited from an actuarial true-up that we highlighted in the previous year\u2019s third quarter. We continue to be focused on driving cost effectiveness into our corporate-related cost structure and continue to expect unallocated corporate cost of approximately $25 million to $35 million per quarter.Now turning to Slide 12, I would like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture initiatives. As many of you know, the company is on significant transformation over the last two years including the $3.3 billion acquisition of CH2M, the over $800 million acquisition of next-generation technologies required for KeyW and the $3.3 billion divestment of our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business.These actions are clearly resulting in a higher margin, higher growth company with more predictable cash flows. These actions, together with our organic growth have driven strong value for our shareholders.Let me provide an update on each, starting with the CH2M integration and cost synergies. I am pleased to have report that we are nearing the completion of the CH2M integration with nearly $175 million of net cost synergies achieved, surpassing our original estimates. We expect the final synergies to be achieved by the end of our calendar year 2019.Turning to ECR, during the quarter, we incurred $70 million of ECR-related transaction separation and restructuring costs. We expect nearly all cost to be incurred by early calendar year 2020. In addition, we are updating our view of both taxes paid on the gain associated with the sale and other one-time costs.While cash taxes are now estimated at $400 million, down from our previous estimate of approximately $500 million, we are also now expecting that our one-time cost will grow from our previous estimate of $200 million.We are actively in the midst of identifying additional cost-reduction benefits due to our transition from a three LOB to a two LOB company. We will provide an update on the cost estimates during our fourth quarter earnings call.Regarding KeyW which closed on June 12, we are making progress achieving the communicated $15 million of runrate cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2020. During the final weeks of the quarter, we incurred approximately $7 million of the $25 million of cost to achieve those synergies.During the quarter, we also incurred $13 million of the expected $16 million of transaction fees, and other one-time acquisition-related cost.Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 13. During the quarter, underlying free cash flow from operations again improved and increased from Q2. This cash flow has been supported by continuing improvement in DSOs given our focus on improving this metric. This metric with DSOs increasing \u2013 or excuse me, decreasing two days from the second quarter level.During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $42 million, of which $3 million was related to ECR. Capital expenditures were also impacted by IT, and real estate, restructuring related to our cost synergy efforts.We continue to target a long-term free cash flow conversion rate of 100%. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1 billion and a gross debt of $1.2 billion resulting in $200 million of net debt. As noted earlier, we now expect to pay approximately $400 million in cash taxes related to the gain on the sale of ECR to Worley.Also, during the quarter, we monetized approximately $65 million of our Worley ownership and currently retain 51 million shares of Worley representing a 9.9% interest in the company. Regarding our capital deployment, we completed the recently announced $250 million ASR on June 5 with the delivery of the remaining 20% of the ASR shares or 0.5 million shares.The program realized an attractive 7470 VWAP value. Immediately following the completion of the ASR, we began repurchasing additional shares through open market purchases and about approximately $100 million of shares as of August 2. We continue to believe that our shares are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value and plan to be active with additional repurchases.However, assuming no additional share repurchase beyond August, 2, we would expect an average share count of 137 million and ending Q4 share count of approximately 135 million shares. We also expect the 25% effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and 24% to 25% effective rate for fiscal 2020.Given our strong balance sheet of free cash flow, we also announced our quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share. As you know, our new dividend level represents an increase of 13% versus our year-ago dividend level.And finally, looking at the right-side of the chart, when accounting for the expected cash taxes and Worley equity, our Q3 pro forma net debt is now approximately $300 million or well under one-times adjusted EBITDA, a clear indication of our strong financial flexibility.Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts. Steven Demetriou : Thanks, Kevin. I am excited about the continued traction of our business transformation. We are seeing a strong inclusive culture developing across Jacobs. Our pipeline is increasing year-over-year with larger higher margin opportunities and we are strategically leveraging our balance sheet, investing in ourselves through timely share buybacks, as well as disciplined and targeted M&A activities and strong growth sectors.The 2019 adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $965 million to $1 billion from the previous range of $920 million to $1 billion. And we are increasing our fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.75 to $5 from our previous guidance of $4.45 to $4.85. This increased outlook accounts for a combination of operational performance, KeyW contributions, discrete tax items and the impact from share repurchases.We have a clear vision and strategy for Jacobs and we will remain disciplined in executing against this. We are well aligned to capture secular growth opportunities. We have a strong balance sheet and we are well positioned to deliver on our financial progress.Operator we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Josh Sullivan : Good morning guys, nice quarter. Steven Demetriou : Good morning, Josh. Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Josh. Josh Sullivan : With the two year budget you are moving forward, can you talk about any particular programs, you are more confident at this point thinking of the confidential KeyW\u2019s space contract, but also is there anything else moved to the left with the budget deal in place in the longer-term? Steven Demetriou : Well, as you know, the two year budget deal set the overall level which was up 3% for defense spending and up 4% for non-defense which obviously is good news for Jacobs over the 2020 and 2021 timeframe. But the details are to come over the next few weeks and potentially few months. I think t he good news is that it was a bipartisan effort to merge the defense and non-defense interest of each party.But we are optimistic from everything we are hearing and our engagement with the hill that the priority areas that we are involved in and especially in space and cyber and mission IT etcetera are going to be the areas that are going to be succeed. NASA is looking strong with some of the commitments around the Artemis mission and putting the first woman on the moon in 2024 and sustainable presence on the moon by 2029.These are areas that we believe will be well funded that will help our efforts of Kennedy, Marshall, Johnson, et cetera. So, more details to come, but it was a very important deal that was struck obviously over the last few days. Josh Sullivan : And then, just on the synthetic compound opportunity, you highlighted in your opening comments, what do you think the timeline of that looks like for it to become a significant contributor? Steven Demetriou : I think we are going to \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to move at a fairly solid pace, because of the importance and the growing exposure, essentially the negative exposure that\u2019s out there on kind of revealing now that this is a concern in soil and water. And so, we, as I mentioned we are well positioned on it and we are right in the middle of it. We have specific Jacobs\u2019s resources that are working with some of the U.S. government agencies now to develop the solutions. And so, I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to help us and as we move into 2020 and 2021 and beyond. Josh Sullivan : Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thank you. Good quarter. Just wondering - a follow-up on some of the comments you made about capital allocation. The stock being undervalued. Just, where would you like to see the balance sheet in terms of leverage, maybe within a year?I mean, is there any \u2013 obviously you are underlevered now. I mean, what sort of the \u2013 what\u2019s your comfort zone? And then maybe if you could comment on how the M&A pipeline looks and your bandwidth for taking on additional acquisitions given KeyW just being closed? Thanks. Steven Demetriou : I\u2019ll let Kevin finish with the \u2013 with our leverage goals, et cetera. But just from a standpoint of the type of things that we are looking at beyond buying back our stock and I\u2019ll always emphasize that the barrier to doing any sort of M&A deal is that it has to be superior to buying back our stock. And buying back our stock as Kevin said is very attractive to us right now.But as we do \u2013 as we are engaged in M&A opportunities for both our BIAF and ATN businesses, it\u2019s very consistent with what we talked about in our Investor Day earlier this year. In BIAF, it\u2019s really to add to the portfolio to be the one stop shop globally.I mean, one of the big areas we see as digital consulting anything that strengthens us in thought leadership around bringing digital and continuing the development of our technology platforms that drive infrastructure.From an ATN standpoint, geographic growth is important to us. We are currently generating very positive margins in our international area and so it\u2019s \u2013 we are going to continue to look for ways to accelerate our presence outside of the U.S. because the majority of our business today is in the U.S.When we acquired KeyW, we were excited about the pipeline of ideas that KeyW had to build that great asset and so it\u2019s an area that we will continue to look at to strengthen our margins and differentiate ourselves in the areas that we talked about whether it\u2019s space, mission IT, cyber. And then, in ATN, again it will be the areas to build our capabilities around our announced technology hubs.But, Kevin, do you want to comment on the financial side of that? Kevin Berryman : Yes, Gautam, I would say, there is a couple things. Clearly, we believe that there is incremental capacity in the organization, resource-wise and focus-wise to be able to continue to drive an M&A agenda in over the next year or two clearly. I think the capacity really starts to probably become even clear in its availability as we kind of execute and finalize the ECR transaction which obviously is coming up here near the end of our calendar year.So, I don\u2019t see that as a hindrance per se as it relates to our efforts to execute over the next year to two. In terms of the leverage factors, I\u2019ve communicated and certainly did that at our Investor Day back in February that with our new portfolio, we feel comfortable with an overall kind of leverage factor of two to three times.However, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that we are willing to go to two to three times if we are not finding attractive acquisition opportunities and that would certainly, we would probably be at a leverage level that\u2019s under two. So, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s specifically answers your question, but it starts to give you some guard rail as it relates to that and certainly we\u2019d be comfortable in the two to three times.But if we are not really active in M&A and as Steve suggested, M&A is got be a value-enhancing effort, but it\u2019s got to equal and it\u2019s got to be strategically aligned with what we want to get accomplish. So, our leverage factors would be less robust I would say, is in fact we are not finding some of these opportunities that kind of hit the mark in terms of our value creation expectations. Gautam Khanna : That\u2019s helpful. And just, as a quick follow-up, is there any update on the timing of the Hanford biz, plus the classified contract? Is the timing still on track as you have communicated before? Steven Demetriou : Yes, I think, we\u2019ve, on the Hanford side, I\u2019d say, slightly moving to the right. Probably, we will hear more \u2013 we will probably hear first on a rebid. And the tank bombs are \u2013 the tank bomb initiative is probably closer to the end of the year \u2013 calendar year.And on the confidential initiative, that one looks like, it\u2019s going to be sometime late next year before it starts to come out for sort of the rebid building significant momentum. So, the good news is, we are continuing to work on our current programs and we are optimistic on some of the new opportunities that you mentioned. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Kevin Berryman : Hey, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Kevin or Steve, can you give us a little more color on ATN margin? I think we can understand that the revenue growth has been coming from the large reimbursable work and procurements? And you have been talking about improving the margin I know you got the longer term guide up as much as 150 basis points. Does the ramp up of fixed price \u2013 which carry higher margin than slower than we thought and should a \u2013 when should ATN margin ramp \u2013 does it ramp up here? Steven Demetriou : It\u2019s a good question. We are confident and we are seeing it that as we pursuing the business we are moving up the value chain. I think what we are all seeing right now in our P&L numbers is the success of the wins back in 2019 around the large enterprise asset management contracts, things like missile defense and SOCOM and JITC that are all ramped up nicely.And most recent one the HTASC \u2013 big army HTASC one and these are very high return, but more modest margin businesses that we\u2019ve discussed. And in the mean time, when you looked at our pipeline of opportunities, it\u2019s rich with these more smaller higher margin, some of them being fixed price and we are seeing the opportunity there.So, we are not seeing any degradation in the margin opportunity. And also KeyW is clearly going to start playing out over the next few quarters to \u2013 from an ATN standpoint, we\u2019ll have a positive impact on both the gross profit margin and the operating profit margin.So, we expect that as we get through the next several quarters, we will start to see some sequential improvement, but it\u2019s the nature of this business that we\u2019ve talked about in the past especially when we have these big successful higher return enterprise management contracts. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Steve. And then, can I ask you, given what\u2019s going on in the world, to give us an update on how you think about the cyclicality of your BIAF business. You got businesses in there like facilities that have been doing well for you.Have you seen any slowdown in that business in terms of project approval? It certainly looks like you have and are there any parts of BIAF that you are concerned about that could be a bit more cyclical? Steven Demetriou : Of our BIAF, $14 billion backlog, the most cyclical in there is, it\u2019s the advanced facilities. But even with that, we are seeing great success based on our alignment with some of the key life sciences and electronics players that some of them are countercyclical in their own CapEx spend.When you look at the backlog in the third quarter, our advanced facilities business had one of the strongest backlogs up close to 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. And we are continuing to move into the areas where the spending is happening. And there is \u2013 for example in life sciences, we talked about biotech and gene therapy and we still see great opportunities there moving forward. And then, when you look at the Brexit impact of the UK, for us, so far so good.In fact, our best year-over-year performance on a percentage basis in the third quarter was in the UK where we had double-digit backlog growth and I can\u2019t say enough about the team in the UK and what they have been able to do to really combine with CH2M and drive the revenue synergies and the things that we are winning are demonstrating market share and growth.And now that, there has been some government change there in the UK that new transport minister and even Boris Johnson himself for showing early on commitment to things that maybe, people were worried about, but showing commitment to high speed to rail which is important for Jacobs and another great area is northern area of UK, which we are well positioned with our Manchester and Leeds offices and we are seeing the new government put some specific focus there.So, I am really proud of our BIAF team in the way that they have been able to offset some headwinds and be driving these types of double-digit backlog and P&L growth. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning and nice quarter. I guess, two questions. One, Kevin, is there anything we should read into the range with one quarter less of EPS. I am just trying to think about why the range would still be so wide. And then I guess, my second question for you just given what the performance you guys have put up and what\u2019s implied for the back half of the year, I mean, you could get their earnings next year easily just on the back half base of $5.60.I know you talked before about 2020 earnings, well north of $5. Am I thinking about it the wrong way, particularly with KeyW I am trying to understand that the cadence to get to the 7 to 8 bucks in earnings power in 2021? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : So, a couple things, Jamie. First one is, as it relates to our current results in this year, remember there is, we probably got about $0.23 of discrete tax items in our numbers. So, it\u2019s something that I just want you to keep track of and understand when you think about any effective transition to thinking about 2020. That\u2019s one item that is worthy I would call out. The other item that you are alluding to is, kind of the range.Look, I think $4.75 to $5 is at the end of the day, plus or minus a number that\u2019s 5%, right. When you take the midpoint, even less than 5%. So, it seems like a reasonable range. I would say, there is always a range around the midpoint which could be associated with fringe releases, or these kinds of things. Of course that project take up or true-ups in terms of cost which could be a number plus or minus.So, I think the ranges are actually quite appropriate at this particular point in time and the range is not indicative of any kind of specific things that are out there which make us nervous relative to plus or minus figures. Steven Demetriou : Operator? Operator : Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Steve, it sounds like the ATN bookings have played out, I think higher than your expectations from the analysts say six months ago where we are looking for 2% to 3% organic growth, but just based on the update that you are giving us here today, if I am reading that correctly, can you just talk about what\u2019s played out better than expected and how you expect organic growth cadence to play out from here after the strong ATN organic growth this quarter? Steven Demetriou : Yes, it\u2019s really \u2013 thank you, Jerry, for the question and we are very excited about what the team is doing globally on ATN and specifically in the U.S., what\u2019s been very positive is I have talked about these large enterprise contracts that we won back in 2018 and how we are ramping them up. And not only has the team done a successful job on getting them fully ramped up.But we are actually finding new opportunities within those \u2013 with those clients on some additional business. And so, I think that\u2019s demonstrating the ability for us to bring new things that we didn\u2019t have a few years ago based on our acquisitions of cyber security, digital capability and now, KeyW is going to head on top of that.Also, when we look at the non-government side, the automotive business, the wind tunnel business has been a high growth opportunity for us and we\u2019ve talked about the wind tunnel capabilities that we are doing globally, but now we are seeing opportunities on electrification, power trains and leading to new R&D facilities and we\u2019ve had great success recently on winning some business not only in the U.S.But in Western Europe and we see that continuing to grow. The telecom business is becoming a bigger business for us based on the success that we\u2019ve had. I think the main driver there has been our operating performance where one of the large clients has extended us from about five or six states to I think it\u2019s thirteen states now and we are well positioned across that whole telecom services area with the movement to 5G.And so, that\u2019s also becoming significant for us. And I mentioned earlier the NASA opportunity. We are \u2013 I think we now have, on a combined Jacobs employees and the contractors that we control over 5,000 employees and we are at all the major sites and what NASA is doing now is a pretty exciting and Jacobs is well positioned for that.So, those are examples that are driving the current success and what I mentioned on the phone call, I think you are going to see a lot more diversification on the business going forward based on the successes that we\u2019ve had. Dawne Hickton coming in, bringing some new leadership and new thinking is already moving the organization into some areas that will allow us to continue to extend the success that ATN has had over the last several years. Jerry Revich : And as you think about your $7 to $8 2021earnings target, can you just talk about your updated thoughts on how back-end loaded is that expected to be? So if you look consensus estimates of about $5.50 next year, we are not going to ask you to comment on that.But if that\u2019s right, it implies a big chunk of your anticipated growth that\u2019s coming in 2021. Is that how you are thinking about it and can you just give us any updated thoughts on the cadence six months later here? Kevin Berryman : Jerry, this is Kevin. First comment, remember that our $7 to $8 was the potential earnings power of the organization in 2021 which is a number that still has the opportunity to be delivered against, especially if we continue to believe that our share price is undervalued and it makes sense for us to continue to be buying back shares.So, clearly, that\u2019s the case. And as we discussed earlier in some of the Q&A comments, the ability to continue to drive M&A is certainly an opportunity that could be accretive to our EPS in 2021 as well. So, both of those are out there and consequently, we like the growth aspirations that we have, I\u2019ll call it organically, as we\u2019ve talked about it.And we\u2019ll see how it plays out relative to our share price and whether or not, we\u2019ve continue to be excited about buying back shares at levels we, as we\u2019ve said during this call, we are continuing to be thinking that we are going to be a proactive participant in the market. So, we\u2019ll see how that plays out. I think that probably gets you to an answer to your question. But is there anything else that I missed there? Jerry Revich : Yes, Kevin, maybe you could just comment on the fundamental part of that equation. So the top-line performance and the margin expansion that you\u2019ve targeted how much of that do you expect to come in 2020 versus 2021 and obviously we can make our own assumptions for capital structure? Kevin Berryman : Yes, we will give guidance in the fourth quarter. We are not going give guidance for 2020 today. I would say two things. One, we are excited about the performance on a year-to-date basis in 2009, which I think positions us well as we continue to drive towards the financial algorithm that we talked about during Investor Day.And I think that in conjunction with the pipeline and a lot of the things that Steve was talking about puts us in a position where 2020 can be another nice solid movement in the direction necessary to get us to the financial algorithm that we had talked about in terms of margin profile and organic growth. So I think that those, as we sit here, three quarters through 2019, we feel good about the first three quarters.We are feeling good how we are going to end up and we felt like we have positioned ourselves well for 2020 as well. Jerry Revich : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen. Steve, want to talk a little bit about labor and I think you add up the numbers, you have almost 50,000 of these employees from what I saw on the slides. How do you feel about the labor pool right now relative to your, obviously 2019, but your 2020, 2021 expectations as you start to think about planning for those years.Is there much more required from an organic basis as the turnover rate has been lower than you would anticipated given your diversity efforts as well? And is there a productivity measure that you certainly think in the next couple years that can drive lot more value relative to the labor force and maybe the OpEx capital spend that you are going to be generating? Steven Demetriou : Yes, well, there is a lot in that question and it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s one of the most important things that we work on every day and that\u2019s why we talk about culture on these earnings calls. Because talent is everyone is looking for the best talents out there in the industry and in certain parts of the world, talent is tight.And the way we are successfully managing that is, and when I look at our BIAF business for example, is a highly successful global integrated delivery capability with the major hubs around the world. We have capabilities in the Philippines and Poland and several areas in India, and even in the U.S. where we are able to capture \u2013 we are able to attract the best talent in those areas and the talent is significant there and deliver projects globally utilizing that talent unlike most of our competitors.And so, that\u2019s been not only an effective way of ensuring that we have the ability to serve our clients\u2019 needs globally, but doing in the most efficient way. When you look at our G&A evolution over the last couple of years as a percent of net revenue, as a company, I think the data is showing that.We, actually, on a year-over-year basis, are about a 100 basis points more efficient when we look at G&A as a percent of net revenue. We\u2019ve been driving sequential improvement and that\u2019s an area that we are going to continue to be focused on.But, at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to be our ability to have the best culture, not only against our direct peers, but across all sort of companies across the globe, because we are trying to get the best functional people, the best engineers, the best cyber, the best architects and on and on and then so, it\u2019s a really a holistic set of initiatives. Michael Dudas : I appreciate that. And I guess, just taking one step further, is Jacobs finding from a business result standpoint because of the success you\u2019ve been driving in the business and the acquisitions that you\u2019ve made a lot more inquiries about acquisitions and such as like the pipeline of those opportunities gotten larger because of your success and where you are driving your growth? Steven Demetriou : Well, I think we have been \u2013 as a company, we have been more intentionally and purposeful on getting the message out. So we are doing a much better job these days of trying to alert the world that the type of things that we are working on and we are hearing and feeling and seeing some measurable excitement around that in our ability to retain our talent.We still are setting much more aggressive metrics and targets to do even better. But I can say that we\u2019ve been pleased with the retention rates of, especially going through a lot of this restructuring in the company.And we are attracting talent. We believe, and again we measure it in a much stronger way than we have over the last several years. I think at some point, as we get more mature and this will be more transparent with some of these metrics.But what I can say is that, it\u2019s clearly demonstrating some early on success, but we have a long way to go in a short period of time to really set the bar on being that employer of choice. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to dig into the guidance range a little bit more here as you guys say early on there that the guidance raise was KeyW and the business so far. When you look at the midpoint of the EPS guidance, it\u2019s up a little bit more than the $0.16 of discrete tax item, the EBITDA guidance is up somewhere on the - what I thought KeyW contribution would be for the year.Is the guidance is mostly KeyW or can you talk about or split how the guidance range is? I am just trying to get our arms around what\u2019s actually incremental in the guidance here? Kevin Berryman : Yes, it\u2019s a little bit different, Andy, depending upon EPS versus EBITDA, because obviously, EPS is all inclusive. So, clearly, the incremental guide on the year for EPS includes the new news relative to the discrete item of $0.16. And effective way there is another, if you kind of just take the midpoint and other, let\u2019s call it $0.07 of EPS, which is a combination of mostly operational improvement, plus a couple pennies, plus from KeyW.And the reason it\u2019s only a couple pennies is, because of the incremental interest costs associated with the fact that we took the debt paid in cash and that\u2019s offsetting effectively the EBITDA that we gain. So, that\u2019s on the EPS front.Let me talk to the \u2013 kind of the EBITDA piece is basically I would say, little bit more than the incremental, let\u2019s say 20 plus is certainly 10 plus to 15 plus of KeyW for the quarter which is primarily coming in the fourth quarter, obviously, given the small stub period of the results in the third quarter.And then a general improvement of $5 million to $15 million of ops improvement over the course of what we\u2019ve been able to perform and what our expectations are for the balance of the year. So you get to those numbers, midpoint is up nearly $20 million on the EBITDA. So a little bit different depending upon what you are talking about for EPS versus EBITDA. Andrew Wittmann : Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you for that. And then, I guess, my follow-up question has to do with cash flow. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the big tax bill in the fourth quarter. So operating cash flow or free cash flow for this year is going to be depressed given that I guess, negative so far year-to-date on that, but as you look and you turn the page into 2020, Kevin, we obviously heard you say and heard you say before that the proxy of a 100% conversion.Do you feel like 2020 is a realistic timeframe assuming nothing else changes. I mean, you went into another big deals there is going to be cash cost with that assuming you take this team to that in 2020, is 2020 a realistic year to think about it approaching that type 100% cash flow conversion rate? Kevin Berryman : I think we are getting a lot closer obviously, because we\u2019ll be through some of the one-offs and cost associated with where we are going through, given the fact that we\u2019ve done a 3 plus billion dollar acquisition or divestiture and a close to $1 billion acquisition all in this third quarter.So, lot of moving pieces, clearly and I think that what will be the determinant of what you are asking is our success on working capital on specifically the DSO management. And just to remind you, Andy, we didn\u2019t have a great start to the year as we kind of got a low off-track with the CH2M integration and we lost some traction on our DSO initiatives.We came back and proved our DSOs in the second quarter, improved them again in the third quarter. But we still got to make more progress for us to be able to get to the place that you are suggesting potentially is available. 2020 might be a challenge if we get there.But we are very much making some really good progress in the second and third quarter, specifically oriented around, now coming together with the CH2M integration largely behind us in terms of system integration. We feel like we are starting to make some really good progress there. Andrew Wittmann : All right. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank Chad Dillard : Hi, good afternoon guys. Kevin Berryman : Hello Chad. Chad Dillard : So, I just wanted to dig more into the ATN project pipeline. I think you talked about $30 billion plus. And I guess first up on the defense side, are you seeing more prime work, and then, how do you think about that potential mix shift in the context of your margins for that sub-segment? And then, secondly, more on the commercial side starting to get a bit more about 5G from you guys.I was hoping you could frame, I think the size of the business, the scope of the work you are pursuing and what sort of growth rate that you are seeing right now? Steven Demetriou : So, our pipeline is three quarters of it. One, 75% is new business, so, versus rebid or similar type business that we have today. So it\u2019s exciting and that it\u2019s demonstrating the extension and expansion of our ATN business. About $1.5 billion of that is the \u2013 as I mentioned in our enterprise, the large enterprise type contracts that we had in the past.And so, what it really kind of demonstrates is that the majority of that pipeline are higher margin, shorter term type business which are going to provide the opportunity for margin expansion for the business. KeyW brings some nice pipeline to us. So, the opportunity is there to get more into space intelligence, compared to what we had in the past.And also we are seeing evidence of the pipeline building based on the combination of capabilities that KeyW and Jacobs bring. So, when you look at the \u2013 you are asking about telecom, the telecom is coming in multiple areas for us. It\u2019s the traditional work that we do for some of the large U.S. players and we are expanding, as I mentioned, geographically across the U.S.But it\u2019s also using these telecom capabilities now and moving into smart city of the smart initiatives with the BIAF, so demonstrating the connectivity between our ATN business and BIAF business. When you put together our cyber business that I mentioned, as we put these different acquisitions and capabilities together and we are creating a special separate business unit focused on that when you look at the automotive business that I referred to.You look at the telecom business, these for us, sort of small pieces of ATN that probably did move the needle back three, four, five years ago that are now becoming significant contributors along with our traditional enterprise work and testing facilities work that we\u2019ve been doing with our core government clients. So we are becoming a much more diverse ATN player as our 30 plus billion dollar pipeline demonstrates. Chad Dillard : And over to BIAF, you mentioned that your infrastructure pipeline is starting to see a larger project. Can you just talk about how has that changed the competitive landscape? How has that changed the speed at what you see bids getting converted into words? And then, how do you think about the impact of margins going forward? Steven Demetriou : Yes, well, I\u2019d say very simple way of describing what\u2019s going on at BIAF is, we are seeing a significant opportunity, near-term and long-term with our existing clients because of the offering now that we bring with the combination of Jacobs CH2M and these other technology capabilities that I have been mentioning including the connectivity with ATN.And so, that higher piece of the pie with these major clients around the world are not only giving us the revenue and profit growth further elevating our margins as some of these are, some of the higher value portions that we didn\u2019t have in the past as when we were a standalone Jacobs, say, three or four years ago.And this other area of markets converging all into sort of one opportunity with clients, and our clients are now needing water, cyber, environmental, mobility, et cetera and we are one of only a few players globally that can bring all that capability for a client\u2019s need. And so, that\u2019s giving us both profit growth and margin improvement.And so, it\u2019s exciting when \u2013 as I mentioned before, we not only have seen significant backlog growth in advanced facilities in the UK, but in the Americas, which still is a very significant part of our BIAF. We had nearly 10% growth in our backlog last quarter. And so, it\u2019s demonstrating measurably what I\u2019ve been talking about with these core clients across the Americas.But then, when if you look at the Middle East and Asia, and what we are doing in areas like the big high speed rail projects, or the big aviation projects that are going on around the world, especially in Asia and the Middle East of water projects in the Middle East we are now involved in Saudi Arabia and UAE on bringing our world-class water capability to these emerging economies.All of this is leading to not only profit growth, but margin enhancement that BIAF has been proving out over the \u2013 really for the last several years and we believe that will continue into the future.So, I want to thank you for all participating on the conference call. As I reflect on our results and positive outlook, the main thing I want to state is I am very proud of our people across the globe at Jacobs. They make it happen.The work we do to the clients that we have the opportunity to work with and the communities that we are impacting around the world is, it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s humbling to all of us at the leadership level.For me, personally, this marks my 40 year anniversary in leading Jacobs and I want to make sure you all know, I am just as excited today as I was in 2015. We have a collective drive to truly become a company like no other and we are asking ourselves every day, why not and in doing so, creating an exciting tomorrow for all of us.So, thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jonathan Doros of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning and afternoon to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks.I'd like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is summarized on slide 2. Certain statements contained in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and such statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided by the same.Statements made in this presentation that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on management's current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain. You should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially.We caution the reader that there are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2019.We are not under any duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after that date of this presentation to conform to actual results, except as required by applicable law.During the presentation, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Please see slide 2 of our presentation for more information on these figures.In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results to prior periods on a pro forma basis. For more information on the calculation of these pro forma metrics, we have provided historical pro forma results in the appendix of this investor presentation. We believe this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods.Included in our historical figures is an adjustment to backlog that incorporates KeyW backlog methodology of booking only the first two years of large multi-year contracts. And we also provide a bit of color on the accounting treatment related to our transition service agreement, TSA, with Worley related to the sale of our ECR business.From a GAAP standpoint, the CSA services provided to Worley are reflected in SG&A, but the reimbursement of those Worley-related costs are recorded in other income below operating profit. As a result, this treatment understates the true operating profit associated with the TSA effort as these costs are being incurred specifically to support services provided to Worley.In our non-GAAP figures, we have reclassified this income as SG&A from other income. We have made this adjustment to reflect a more accurate representation of our underlying operating performance.Let me we also review the components of our adjusted EBITDA outlook provided today. Presently, our adjusted EBITDA results and outlook based on adjusted operating profit plus depreciation methodology. We will be transitioning to referencing and providing guidance on adjusted EBITDA that includes the net impact on other income and non-controlling interests. Please see a reconciliation on slide 24.We believe the current consensus expectations include a mix of EBITDA methodologies. So, we encourage our sell side to model adjusted EBITDA calculation to include the net impact from noncontrolling interest and other income.In addition, when calculating EBITDA from adjusted operating profit, remember that our adjusted operating profit already adds back amortization from intangibles.Turning to the agenda on slide 4. Speaking on today's call will be our Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou, and President and CFO, Kevin Berryman. In addition, President and COO, Bob Pragada, will join today and will be participating in the Q&A session.Steve will begin by providing a recap of our financial results, discuss key elements of our strategy and review our performance by line of business. Kevin will then provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics and provide an update on our acquisitions and ECR divestiture as well as review our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we'll open the call for your questions.With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chari and CEO. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, John. Turning to slide 5. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 financial results and the progress we're making, executing against the strategy we outlined at our February 2019 investor day.Before we discuss our results, I'd like to recap last week's announced expanded leadership goals for Bob Pragada and Kevin Berryman. Bob's promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer of Jacobs and will now oversee all global operations.Kevin is promoted to President and Chief Financial Officer, adding to to his current responsibilities are Jacobs' digital and information technology function.Both these leaders have been instrumental in driving Jacob's industry-leading financial performance and superior shareholder value creation. As CEO, I'll continue to lead Jacobs, working closely with Bob, Kevin and the rest of the executive leadership team to build on our momentum and execute our strategy to deliver compelling value for clients and shareholders.As you've heard me say, we're on a journey to create a company like no other. And over the last few years, we've been transforming our business to a higher value, high-growth, solutions-focused company.Today, our company is well-diversified across sectors and geographies and exposure to multiple secular growth trends of climate change, environmental resiliency, space intelligence, urbanization and the convergence of IT/OT, as well as exposure to long-term sustainable cash flow streams such as national security and nuclear cleanup that enhance the stability of our portfolio.More importantly, we believe the combination of our relentless drive to achieving a high performance culture, demonstrating a strong execution discipline to profitably grow and making innovation our connective foundation will be a competitive advantage for decades to come.For the most recent quarter, our financial results were strong. On a year-over-year basis, fourth-quarter net revenue grew by 10% on a pro forma basis, including KeyW.Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was 15% higher than last year and adjusted EPS of $1.48 was up 29% including $0.09 of discrete tax benefits.For the fiscal year, we posted double-digit adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth even when excluding the benefit from acquisitions and discrete tax items.During the quarter, we executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase and have bought back approximately $850 million of our shares during fiscal 2019.From a flexibility standpoint, we maintain a healthy balance sheet that provides the opportunity to further deploy capital toward high return investments.Given our strong operating performance and positive outlook, we're introducing adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance, which at the midpoint represents double-digit growth and we're well positioned to reach our 2021 EBITDA growth targets.Now on to slide six to discuss our new brand. Many of you may have seen our new brand video when you joined today's earnings call. For those that haven't, I encourage you to visit our investor site where we've included a link on the earnings call slide deck.It's proven that companies with strong brands have a significant competitive advantage in terms of attracting and retaining the best talent and building stronger relationships with clients, unlocking velocity to compound above-market growth rates.We have created a new brand to reflect our transformation, unite our people under a common purpose and showcase the innovative and meaningful work we do for our clients and communities. Given our transformed business, now is the opportune moment to tell our story to the world, combining our rich history and future strategy.Central to the brand is our new tagline \u2013 Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow. \u2013 signaling our transition from engineering and construction to a global technology forward solutions company.Challenging today is our response to the increase in complexity our world is experiencing. It calls on us to join forces, putting our knowledge and imagination together to reinvent the way we solve problems and shape the next generation of innovative solutions.Reinventing tomorrow is our promise and an invitation to challenge what's accepted and raise the bar in everything we do \u2013 from the brilliant solutions we create with our clients to the open, inclusive culture we create for our people, from the positive difference we make in our communities to the added value we deliver to our shareholders.Together, we're pushing the limits of what's possible. We stay ahead to create the new standards our future needs.The culmination is symbolized within our new logo. As you have seen, we chose to change our ticker symbol to J, to signify our focus on delivering integrated solutions. And we're also preparing to change our legal name to Jacobs Solutions.Continuing with the discussion on our brand, let's turn to slide seven. At Jacobs, it's crucial to our strategy to align around common values that guide our behavior and unify as one company worldwide when interacting with clients, employees, communities and shareholders.While the values our company has always stood for haven't changed, the way we articulate them have.First, we do things right, which means we always act with integrity, taking responsibility for our work and caring for our people. We make investments in our clients company, communities, so we can grow together. An example is our sustainability strategy named Plan Beyond, which focuses on planning beyond today for a more sustainable future for everyone.Second, we challenge the accepted. To create a better future, we must ask the difficult questions. Always staying curious. We're not afraid try new things. Beyond If is our global innovation program focused on our agility to challenge the accepted, with the domain expertise to push beyond our boundaries and deliver for today and into tomorrow.Third, we aim higher. We don't settle. Always looking beyond to raise the bar and deliver with excellence. We're committed to our clients, bringing more valuable solutions for shared success.This value is reinforced with our Beyond Excellence approach to solving our customers challenges with the highest standards of quality and performance excellence.And finally, we live inclusion. We have an unparalleled focus on inclusion, with a diverse team of thinkers, visionaries and doers, we embrace all perspectives to make a positive impact.Together Beyond is our approach to living inclusion and enabling diversity and equality globally. For us, this means creating a culture of belonging where we thrive and embrace all perspectives.Turning to slide 8, earlier this year in our investor day, we announced five innovation hubs. Today, I'd like to discuss how we're leveraging two of those hubs \u2013 IOT and predictive analytics.Across our businesses, we have accumulated decades of domain intelligence, contained in both structured and unstructured data sets that when applied against advanced algorithms, powered by nearly infinite compute capacity, are driving revolutionary outcomes for clients and higher margins for Jacobs.We're only at the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible. For example, today we're partnering with a leading technology provider to bring to market an artificial intelligence solution for our water customers.Through decades of work in the water sector, we've created one of the most extensive video data sets in classifying [defects] [ph] in buried infrastructure. We have taken this data set and adjusted it into a specialized cloud-based AI algorithm to autoscore water infrastructure inspection video, to deliver higher quality and more consistent risk scoring.The result is a tenfold increase in the analyzing throughput of this inspection technology. We plan to formally introduce this to our client base over the next 12 months. The return profile of this type of solution is orders of magnitude higher than the traditional approach as this capability lowers the cost for our customers, increases our per-unit profitability and establishes an incremental network effect on data which further enhances the quality and insights of our technology.Now moving to slide 9. Before I go into each of our two businesses, I'd like to highlight our new line of business names. Using the new brand as inspiration, we've renamed our lines of business to reinforce our transformation to a solutions-based company and reflect a sense of pride our people have for the outcomes they're delivering with our clients.Our new lines of business names are Critical Mission Solutions, formally Aerospace, Technology and Nuclear, which puts our clients' mission at the center of everything we do. And People & Places Solutions, formerly Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, which reinforces our drive to improve the lives of people everywhere and the positive impact and value our solutions bring to our clients, community and society as a whole.So, now starting with Critical Mission Solutions. Our pro forma backlog is up $400 million from last year to $8.5 billion. And when considering the full value of our contracts, including options and extensions, Critical Mission Solutions backlog would be almost 40% larger.We continue to call out two significant Critical Mission Solutions \u2013 Hanford plateau remediation and a classified network security program with the US government that are burning revenue without a corresponding increase in backlog. Without this dynamic, our Critical Mission Solutions backlog would have increased in the high-single digits for prior-year.Critical Mission Solutions' unique delivery model combines strong technical expertise, localized delivery and an ambitious cost structure and continues to deliver growth and ultimately a transition to [indiscernible].From an industry sector standpoint, space exploration continues to be an attractive opportunity. Jacobs is proud to be NASA's largest provider of professional technology services.In fiscal year 2019, our NASA portfolio continued to grow as we built, delivered solutions to their most important missions. In partnership with the Johnson Space Center, Jacobs plays a crucial role across five NASA centers supporting the Artemis Moon Program.Through our intelligent asset management solutions, we've continued to improve operations and reduce the cost of maintenance of NASA facilities. A great example is our work on the five-year modernization program at the Ames arc jet complex.Critical Mission Solutions also provides strong technical expertise to mission-critical sectors, serving the US military warfighter and intelligence agencies. We saw a significant incremental revenue during the quarter from our recent win of the Army's military intelligence, Huachuca Training and Support Contract where Jacobs provides critical training and testing programs.In addition, we were recently awarded a role to provide intelligence analysis services for the Defense intelligence agency under a multibillion-dollar, five-year IDIQ contract.We also recently won a recompete assignment for the National Science Foundation. Our superior, agile software development capability was critical to winning. This was originally a contract from Blue Canopy, demonstrating the continued benefits from this strategic acquisition.And consistent with our organic growth strategy, Critical Mission Solutions is successfully expanding further into higher growth and higher-margin sectors like telecom 5G, data analytics, cybersecurity, C5ISR.Our telecom business grew by approximately 50% in fiscal year 2019, benefiting from the shift to 5G small cell sites as cities deploy intelligent infrastructure. Our telecom team provides differentiated consulting services and infrastructure services to support this multi-decade opportunity in close collaboration with our People & Places Solutions line of business.The KeyW acquisition closed in June. Fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations. We're off to a great start with our integration process and well-positioned to achieve both cost and revenue synergies in fiscal year 2020.KeyW is a strategic game-changing investment, delivering mission IT and cybersecurity solutions, along with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance products.During the first quarter of 2020, leveraging the combined Jacobs KeyW capabilities, we won a five-year, $216 million contract for the Department of Defense Cybercrime Center for specialized cybersecurity training.This win represents the first of many KeyW revenue synergies that we expect to achieve and it is exciting to see our teams come together so quickly and delivering incremental strategic growth opportunities.In summary, we're pleased with the Critical Mission Solutions performance. And as we look forward, our [indiscernible] pipeline has grown to $33 billion in opportunities, up 10% from last quarter. We're excited to begin the new fiscal year with such momentum, positioning us for the next major set of incremental awards toward the end of fiscal year 2020.Now, moving to slide 10. People & Places Solutions posted strong fourth quarter results with backlog growing 10% year-over-year to $14 billion. Our People & Places Solutions business has a diversified set of high-value industry sectors and geographies. We're well aligned to multiple secular growth trends such as climate change resiliency, access to clean water, urbanization, advances in cell and gene therapy, cloud computing and the convergence of information and operations technology.At our investor day earlier this year, we focused on three areas \u2013 market, digital and global connectivity. Together, we believe these strategic pillars allow us to execute against higher value opportunities and respond quickly to ever-evolving market conditions.Our market connectivity is a differentiator during customer pursuits as advancements in technology drive connected infrastructure. We're a clear leader across multiple sectors such as environmental, water, transit advanced facilities as well as delivery platforms such as program management and strategic consulting.We believe combining our deep domain expertise across different sectors of scale will lead to share gains through cycles. We've institutionalized the execution of this strategy through our global solutions and technology organization, which aligns Jacob subject matter experts to drive thought leadership and to develop the next generation of global talent.We are clearly capturing a higher percentage of opportunities as we continue to leverage the Jacob CH2M combination. Let me provide a recent example. In Germany, we were selected as program manager for SuedLink, a new renewable energy project to integrate wind and solar power into Germany's electricity grid. Jacobs was chosen based on our differentiated delivery solution and comprehensive expertise in complex one-of-a-kind programs.Moving to digital connectivity, we're leveraging our deep domain expertise in existing digital capabilities across the entire company to provide our clients world-class solutions. For example, we recently won a project to deliver enterprise IT operations solutions with a major US airport.The project incorporates cybersecurity and data analytics from our recent KeyW acquisition with our smart cities technical expertise. We integrated our industry-leading aviation domain knowledge with our advanced security operations capabilities to win this multi-year opportunity.Going forward, we expect our digital solutions to be a major driver of growth as we further connect our technological expertise and intellectual property across our businesses.Our global connectivity affords us the ability to utilize global Jacobs talent to provide unique solutions to local clients. We do this primarily in two ways \u2013 deploying highly technical expertise in a variety of disciplines to local projects around the world and digitally delivering complex solutions from our global delivery centers.During the quarter, the volume of work we delivered through global integrated delivery model more than doubled with further potential for strong growth. This increase provides benefits to profitability through better utilization and creates multiple centers of excellence to attract, develop and retain the best and brightest talent.An example of a recent win driven by our global connectivity is in Asia, a fast growing aviation market. We were able to leverage the best thought leaders within our global aviation practice who have delivered many of the world's largest, most complex airports with our local expertise to win the program management for the Manila International Airport.This aviation facility will include three new terminals, four runways and support facilities on over 6,200 acres of reclaimed land and will accommodate up to 100 million passengers per year, making it one of the world's largest air travel hubs.Linking our connectivity strategies together is our acquisition of a 50% share in Simetrica, a UK-based organization with global reach that specializes in social value measurement and well-being analysis.As the public and private sectors make infrastructure investments that impact local communities, returns are not always straightforward to assess and involve understanding the overall impact on society including economic, environmental and wider social impact.Simetrica has developed industry-leading techniques and technologies for assessing social value, deploying today over 1,000 clients. We will work with Simetrica to scale these offerings and solutions both locally and globally.As you can see, our People & Places Solutions business is making meaningful progress in implementing its strategy and deriving the benefits of market, digital and global connectivity. We see a continued expansion of our sales pipeline on a year-on-year basis, with many of our larger opportunities slated for award in the second half of fiscal 2020.Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Steve. So, before we review our results, I would like to remind everyone that recast pro forma adjusted figures have been included in our appendices to this presentation. We have updated and provided results for all quarters in fiscal 2018 and 2019 on a consistent basis from the time they were provided in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.We provide this updated historical disclosure to ensure clarity of how the business is performing on a comparable basis year-over-year. I will be referring to these figures throughout my remarks.Our fiscal 2019 growth rates factor in a full quarter of CH2M for fiscal Q1 2018 which closed during that quarter. I would also note that the change to our line of business names does not impact our line of business financial reporting.So, let me turn to slide 11 where I will discuss a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the fourth quarter.Fourth-quarter gross revenue increased 13% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue including KeyW up 10%. Both Critical Mission Solutions and People & Places Solutions contributed to the strong topline growth.Fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins as a percent of net revenue were 24.9%, up 100 basis points sequentially, but down a bit, 50 basis points, year-over-year, primarily due to a mix of larger contracts in People & Places Solutions that tend to have lower gross margin, but also deliver substantial absolute gross margin dollar levels.We also continue to recognize meaningful [indiscernible] related revenue within Critical Mission Solutions which also carry a lower reported gross margin, but again attractive and lower risk return on capital dynamics.Our adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue fell by 50 basis points year-over-year and 75 basis points on a pro forma basis including KeyW to 15.4%, indicating continued strong cost control and the realization of cost synergies from CH2M and KeyW.It is important to keep in mind that as we scale and become more efficient, part of any G&A savings flow back to government services via lower reimbursable rates. This phenomena is associated with federal pricing requirements by both federal and state and local clients.While this may lower our gross margins, it has a clear benefit to G&A and operating profit levels. It also, of course, increases our competitiveness when pursuing these types of contracts.GAAP operating profit was $99 million and include $103 million of restructuring and other charges, $5 million of transaction costs incurred primarily in connection with the Wood acquisition and $45 million of other adjustments consisting of $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $22 million of costs associated with Worley transition services agreement previously noted by Jon, of which $21 million of costs were reimbursed from reported and other income.Adjusting for these item, adjusted operating profit was $253 million, up 15% from the prior year and 11% on a pro forma basis including KeyW.Moving on, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.4%, flat year-over-year. The margin included the headwind from Critical Mission Solutions, offset by strong operating margin expansion in People & Places Solutions. I'll discuss further the underlying drivers by line of business later in my remarks.Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $274 million or 10% of net revenue $274 million or 10% of net revenue.GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $22 million and $0.16 per share, impacted mainly by $0.61 per share of after-tax restructuring and other charges as noted above, $0.04 per share of after-tax transaction costs primarily associated with the Wood acquisition and $0.67 per share of adjustments consisting mainly of intangible amortization of $0.13, mark-to-market adjustments associated with Worley equity and other ECR related matters of $0.36 and tax reform related adjustments of $0.18.Additional reconciliation detail can be found in the press release and in the appendix of this investor presentation.Excluding these items, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.48 including a $0.09 benefit from discrete tax items. KeyW did not materially contribute to EPS during the quarter as the operating profit was effectively offset by the incremental interest expense associated with the transaction.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book to bill ratio was above 1.1 times for Q4. And note that our backlog only includes the first two years of SuedLink win per our bookings policy. In addition, the backdrop does not include the recently awarded Q1 2020 cybersecurity awards discussed earlier by Steve.Turning to a review of our fiscal year 2019 result on slide 12. Gross revenue increased strongly to 20% year-over-year and pro forma net revenue increased 11%. Pro forma book to bill for the year was 1.1 times.Overall, the pipeline of opportunities across all business remains strong as we begin to see CH2M and KeyW synergies flowing to revenue.GAAP operating profit was $405 million and adjusted operating profit was $893 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year on an organic and pro forma basis.Adjusted operating profit margins were 8.8% for the year, up 50 basis points year-over-year. We have made strong initial progress against our strategic target objective of over 150 basis points of margin expansion by the year 2021, driven by successfully executing against CH2M cost synergies and we see further upside to adjusted operating profit margins as we leverage our global delivery model, executing against higher margin opportunities in the pipeline and also being able to benefit from operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line.GAAP earnings and EPS were $291 million and $2.09 respectively and included $1.75 of restructuring cost \u2013 $1.75 EPS, that is. $0.12 was related to transactional-related costs, $1.10 of other costs and that includes $0.42 of amortization of intangibles. In addition, it also includes $1.75 of restructuring charges.Going forward, we expect our GAAP to adjusted EPS differential to significantly improve as we exit our second quarter 2020 after completion of the ECR separation and other restructuring actions.Adjusted EPS was $5.05, up 30% year-over-year and at the high-end of our $4.75 to $5 outlook when excluding the benefit of the $0.09 of discrete tax items in the fourth quarter.It is important to note that adjusted EPS includes $0.32 of fiscal year discrete tax benefits. Excluding the impact of these discrete tax benefits actually in this year and last, adjusted EPS grew over 20%.Finally, adjusted EBITDA was $981 million, up over 13% on both a pro forma and organic basis, and was at the midpoint of our updated $965 million to $1 billion outlook.Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to slide 13. Starting with Critical Mission Solutions, pro forma revenue including KeyW grew 10% year-over-year during the fourth quarter.In line with last quarter, revenue mix was impacted by large reimbursable enterprise contracts and higher procurement activities, resulting in operating profit \u2013 for the quarter \u2013 margin at 6.7%. Importantly, these contracts remain highly attractive from a total return basis as they offer multi-year stability, lower risk and minimal working capital investment level.For the year, on a pro forma basis including KeyW, revenue and adjusted operating profit were up 13% and 14% respectively. Fiscal year operating profit margins were 6.8% of revenue.Over the course of fiscal 2020, we expect operating profit margins to benefit from our shift to a higher value mix including more fixed price services contracts and a higher contribution from the recently acquired KeyW.Again, it is important to note that our focus in Critical Mission Solutions remains on driving operating profit growth. Given that the structure of joint ventures can impact our revenue, may or may not be reported on our P&L which can impact headline margin percentages.We continue to believe that operating profit growth is the best indicator of our performance and we expect that Critical Mission Solutions operating profit compound annual growth rate in line with our previous guidance provided.Regarding KeyW, September results were in line with our expectations and the strategic project for the acquisition and associated revenue synergies over the medium term is proving out actually real time as our pipeline and bookings efforts are already building momentum. As Steve mentioned, our joint teams have already won a major cyber contract, a clear indication that synergies are materializing.Moving to People & Places Solutions, Q4 net revenue grew 9% year-over-year and operating profit was up 19%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 14.3% for the quarter, up 120 basis points from a year ago.People & Places Solutions had a very strong fiscal year 2019. Including the Q1 2018 pro forma impact from CH2M, net revenue was up over 9% and operating profit was up 14% year-over-year. Operating profit margins were 12.7%, up 50 basis points versus a year ago.Our strategy to target continued margin improvement going forward will be driven by aligning the portfolio to secular growth opportunities, leveraging the benefits of scale from our global model, strong project execution and focusing on higher margin opportunities.Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $33 million for the quarter and $131 million for the year. As we continue to be focused on driving cost effectiveness into our corporate-related cost structure, we expect $25 million to $35 million per quarter of unallocated corporate expenses. Notwithstanding our continued focus on cost discipline, we will proactively evaluate incremental investments that will support our digital and innovation journey.Now turning to slide 14, I'd like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture transformational actions. As we have previously stated, the CH2M integration is near complete with net cost and revenue synergies exceeding our original business case for the acquisition.Regarding the sale of ECR, to date, we have incurred $153 million of the over $200 million in related transaction, separation and restructuring costs. We expect nearly all remaining costs to be incurred near the end of the first half of fiscal 2020.Regarding KeyW, while synergies realize in the quarter were quite minimal, as of the end of Q4, we achieved a run rate of $11 million of our target of $15 million in cost synergies, which resulted in our spending $17 million of our estimated $25 million of costs to achieve those synergies. To date, we have also incurred $13 million of transaction fees and other one-time acquisition related costs.Regarding Wood's nuclear business, our acquisition remains on track to close in our fiscal Q2 quarter. Our integration team is proactively finalizing integration plans.As Steve discussed, we also acquired a 50% ownership in Simetrica, which was immaterial from a financial standpoint, but certainly quite strategic in our drive towards becoming more value-added solutions provider.Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on slide 15. During the quarter, underlying free cash flow again improved. Whilst reported free cash flow for the quarter was negative, this included multiple one-time items related to our transformation efforts.Specifically, we paid $390 million of cash taxes related to the gain on our $3.4 billion sale of ECR, which actually closed in the fiscal third quarter; $100 million for the settlement of the legal matter which is also related to the ECR business; $4 million dollars net cash flows related to restructuring and sale of ECR and one-time expenses related to the KeyW acquisition.Excluding these amounts associated with our transformation and consistent with normal seasonality, our Q4 cash flow conversions factor was well above our long-term target. We believe that this provides further revenue to our ability to drive to a free cash flow conversion factor of 1 time longer term.DSOs ticked down compared with Q3 2019, consistent with our drive to reduce this key metric. We remain focused on improving collections now that we have made great progress moving to a common ERP platform and improving associated working capital processes. In fact, from Q1 this year, DSOs improved by 4 days.We entered the quarter with cash of approximately $630 million and a gross debt of $1.4 billion, resulting in $770 million in net debt before attributing the benefit of our $0.5 billion in Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt position would be approximately $300 million or less than 1 time adjusted EBITDA.It is clear we have strong financial flexibility even when excluding the Worley equity and believe the addition of our talented ECR team with Worley will support long-term value creation opportunities for the shares. While our lock-up period ends in December, we will remain thoughtful and strategic regarding our position in the company.Regarding our capital deployment, in August, we executed a $250 million ASR with final delivery of the remaining 20% of shares expected in December. We continue to believe that our shares are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value and we expect to fully utilize our remaining share buyback authorization over time.For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share cap of $134 million for fiscal year 2020, although the timing of future share repurchases can be driven by short-term dislocation in share price.We also expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24% for fiscal 2020.When modeling quarterly EPS, we would suggest incorporating historical seasonality on an underlying basis, especially while considering the sequential change from the last quarter in fiscal 2019 after adjusting for discrete tax items to the first quarter of fiscal 2020.Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was previously declared at $0.17 per share in September. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 13% versus a year ago.Now, I'll turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts on slide 16. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Kevin. I am excited about the continued traction of our business transformation. We are seeing a strong inclusive culture developing across Jacobs. Our pipeline is increasing year-over-year with larger, higher margin opportunities and we are strategically leveraging our balance sheet, investing in ourselves through timely share buybacks, as well as disciplined and targeted M&A activities in strong growth sectors.We're introducing fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We're also initiating fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.80, which at the midpoint represents a 17% year-over-year growth when excluding the impact of fiscal 2019 discrete tax items.In summary, fiscal 2019 was a strong year of performance. We have a clear vision and strategy for Jacobs and we'll remain disciplined in executing against it. We're well-aligned to capture secular growth opportunities, we have a strong balance sheet and we're well positioned to deliver on our financial targets.Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions. First, if you could talk to, Kevin, just what's implied for organic revenue growth in margins by segment in the 2020 guidance and what we're assuming for KeyW and Wood.And then, my second question, just where we sit today, your comfort level with the $7 to $8 of sort of EPS targets that you guys gave at the analyst day last February for 2021. Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Yeah, we haven't disclosed actually the specific numbers, Jamie. And thanks for your question relative to the growth factors in 2020. But on a net revenue basis, we certainly believe we're in the higher as opposed to lower single digit numbers in terms of our organic revenue growth and we're excited about that. And, of course, all of this is consistent with what I would characterize as pro forma number. So, we've adjusted history relative to that. So, good solid mid to higher single digit level growth factors for the businesses.I think that, as we think about the other comment, I still believe that the $7 to $8 kind of what I would call earnings potential power is potentially out there and available to us. Our ability to ultimately deliver against that is going to be driven a lot by our ability to continue to execute against share buybacks in a manner that's consistent with creating incremental shareholder value and, obviously, the potential for incremental M&A activities which ultimately have to work from a strategic perspective as well as a financial one. So, we feel great about where we are relative to that, although it's clear that, while the earnings potential is there, it's got to make economic sense for us to be able to deliver against that. And I think that's exactly consistent with how we thought about it back in investor day, and so really no fundamental change from our perspective. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes Andy Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Could I ask Jamie's question in a slightly different way? So, pro forma net revenue growth for FY 2019 was up 11%, as you said. Your guidance for this three-year period is 3% to 5% NSR growth. Obviously, a good start to the three-year plan. So, could you talk about what in your businesses is performing better than you thought? And would you agree that that 3% to 5% at this point may end up being a bit conservative? I know it's only a year into the plan. Kevin Berryman : So, we've characterized our growth in terms of a range of levels and certainly, at this particular point in time, our net revenue growth would be kind of at the high end of our range, right around that. So, I don't know that we would ultimately say that we're executing at a different level than what we've always said. This is clearly within the range of what we said. We're very pleased with the fact that we're at that upper end of the range and we would expect that, hopefully, we'll be able to continue to deliver against it.What we see right now is what is in front of us for 2020. If we think about going beyond into 2021, we'll play it year by year and execute accordingly, but we feel pretty good about where we are right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : Kevin, have you won more than you thought in terms of reups on the government side or infrastructure side? Any sort of more color on where you've done better? Kevin Berryman : Yeah. Starting with building the People & Places Solutions, clearly, the momentum of Jacobs and CH2M and unleashing the strength of that combination has been exciting and has contributed to some of the higher numbers that you're seeing.I think we have been also pleased with the continuation on the advanced facility side in both life sciences and electronics. We keep thinking about whether there's going to be bit of a pullback and the good news is it continued to stay strong all the way through 2019. We actually see ourselves entering 2020 still in a very robust environment on that sector. And so, overall, the People & Places Solutions business is really strong across the board with everything going on with infrastructure globally.I think on the Critical Mission Solutions, we are seeing better-than-expected results on the NASA side of things. We've got our existing contracts, but there's been some pretty good plus ups going on that NASA is aggressively now going after the whole Artemes mission and that cuts across about five different space centers where we participate. So, things have gone well there. The missile defense program that we won a year-and-a-half or so ago, we're actually finding that we're getting some add-on opportunities as a result of the solutions that we're providing now that we're demonstrating in that relationship. So, the existing programs, I think, are going very well and we're winning what we're supposed to win. So, very pleased across both sides of businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Hi. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you folks can just give us an update on the M&A pipeline and the strategic capital allocation opportunities where you folks have been able to do really well as reshaping the portfolio. And I'm wondering, as you look at the opportunity set today, how does that compare versus when you initially laid out the strategy in terms of what's out there and what's feasible within the new portfolio? Steve Demetriou : Yeah, the M&A pipeline continue to be pretty rich because our M&A team is doing a great job working with the two business lines on exploring some of the traditional bolt-on opportunities as well as the differentiated opportunities as we really look at strengthening ourselves in areas like consulting, strengthening ourselves in digital capability and innovative technology. And so, there's lots of opportunities out there. But as Kevin said and I said in both our remarks, we're going to remain very disciplined. And, obviously, we're not going to make M&A moves just for the sake of scale. They've got to be value creating and we continue to believe that we've got a great investment opportunity in ourselves. And so, this is going to be a balance of just monitoring the M&A market against buying back our own shares. And so, our capital deployment strategy will remain disciplined. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then, on KeyW specifically, I think the initial target was 2020 EBITDA of about $80 million or so. Can you just comment on whether it's still tracking in line with those expectations? And the classified network security program with the US government, can you just give us an update on timing of when that could proceed to the booking space? I think that was distinct from the cybercrime center award that you mentioned, right? Those are two separate platforms? Steve Demetriou : Yeah. So, as I mentioned in my remarks, we believe in the long term benefit of KeyW. We do think it's going to be a game changer for Jacobs. Nothing has changed from the time we bought it. And if anything, what has excited us are the synergy opportunities across all of Jacobs. So, the benefits that we're seeing are People & Places Solutions now going after in combination with the KeyW organization.I think, overall, our opportunity is the same, the mix of where it will come from, some of it we may actually see spill over into the People & Places Solutions business versus some of the specific businesses that maybe we thought were going to show up in the traditional KeyW area just based on timing. The special project that you talked about, we remain extremely confident, if not more confident, but the timing of it is still sort of something that isn't, obviously, in our hands and we're continuing to demonstrate the success and the staging of that, but not sure that'll play through completely in 2020 as we had previously expected. But as I said, our team is more confident today that that's going to ultimately come to fruition. And whether it spills over into the first half of 2021 or second half of 2020, we can't say for sure here today.But I'll just give you one sort of example of why we're excited about KeyW and the combination with Jacobs. Prior to KeyW, we, Jacobs, were at about 50% of the intel agencies across the whole $60 billion intel business. And now with KeyW, we're 100% covered with all of the agencies. And that's where we're getting excited about the pipeline, maybe more than we had thought prior to acquiring it. And so, whereas we talk about the space intelligence as a tremendous opportunity, we're now getting even more excited about the cyber side and the intel side, the mission IT side. And so, that's where my comments were around. The mix is different, but the overall opportunity is very exciting going forward. Kevin Berryman : Jerry, you also made the comment about the $80 million of EBITDA. It was actually not $80 million in 2020. What we assumed when we quoted that number was understanding if we've received and gotten all synergies in place by that \u2013 so our actual numbers that we were targeting as it relates to when we announced the acquisition was closer to $70 million for the 2020 year, not $80 million. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird. Your line is open. Andrew Wittmann : Oh, great. Guys, I wanted to just talk a little bit about cash flow. I guess we'll pin this under the outlook for 2020 more than anything. Understanding here, Kevin, you made the point on the fourth quarter when you add back a couple of things that cash flows in line of your long-term targets, I guess for 2020, can you give kind of what the actual cash flow will be or what your guidance is considering that there still are restructuring programs and other things that are going on. So, I just want to understand kind of what your kind of GAAP guidance is for cash flow and if you just can update us to bridge us what the underlying number would be? Kevin Berryman : So, we haven't guided [indiscernible] cash flow, but let me make some, Andrew, comments to help give you some incremental perspective and insight as it relates to that. In our numbers for the year 2019, at the end, there was a chunk of cash that openly went out excluding the receipt of the proceeds from ECR, but a lot of the other cash, whether it was restructuring or taxes or whatnot, probably at the end of the day, over $450 million for the full year. So, that's another point that's going to, obviously, start to significantly go away. I would say Q1 is still going to be a fairly large investment profile in the restructuring and efforts to disassociate and separate the businesses as we exit from our TSA arrangement with Worley. So, a big chunk of cash will go out in the first quarter and that will start to tail off in the second quarter. Probably have another $50 million plus of costs mostly in \u2013 I would say in the fourth quarter, I would say \u2013 our excuse me, our first quarter of 2020. CH2M is effectively dwindling to not much. And then really what we're talking about is the incremental stuff associated with KeyW and Wood, which we've already talked about in terms of what those one-time costs are.So, while there still is a chunk of, let's call it, restructuring related activities, less than 100 probably, but certainly a heck of a lot less than what the numbers that we incorporated in 2019. So, our cash flow as we enter into 2020 and then get to the end of the 2020 is going to become much cleaner and more operationally oriented.If you kind of peel away all of the one-time items that were associated with our significant transformation, and I would say 2019 is the year where all what's happening at the same time, finishing up CH, driving ECR, that fundamentally, if you'd peel way all of that, we were kind of approaching 85% maybe of conversion factor relative to the income levels, the net income levels associated with that after adding back amortization. So, that is a baseline in my mind in terms of how we would think about driving our business going forward from the cash flow.I said to you in the past and I think that's certainly our view is that, our expectation is that, over the course of 2020, we're going to be able to get to that conversion factor that we've talked about at 1 times. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. That's helpful. Just my follow-up, was this going to be \u2013 is the Wood Group nuclear acquisition in the guidance? Kevin Berryman : I would say technically yes. But we've adjusted it \u2013 risk adjusted it because of lack of clarity as to when it's going to close and when that might be. I think what \u2013 maybe I would say that when we ultimately get the final, hopefully, completion of the deal, sometime around the middle of our calendar \u2013 excuse me, our fiscal year, we'll give you an update and let you know exactly where we are relative to what the implications of Wood will be relative to that. But I would say technically yes, but it's not really very mature because we've risk adjusted it to some extent because of the unknown in terms of the timing. Operator : Your next question from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. The $25 million charge that you guys cited in the footnotes, was that in the fiscal fourth quarter? And can you give a little color on what caused it? And then, more broadly on margins, can you just talk about which segment you see has the better potential to drive higher margin improvement over the next couple of years? Kevin Berryman : So, the $25 million is where? I'm sorry. Steven Fisher : You had it in the footnotes in the release as it was a $25 million charge in the fiscal year and I couldn't tell if it was in \u2013 if it was a project charge. I couldn't tell if it was the fourth quarter or sometime earlier in the year. Kevin Berryman : So, yes, it was related to a specific project in the People & Places Solutions businesses. So, it was spread over the course of the year. Bulk of it in Q3 and Q4. So, yes, that was in our 2019 results. Steven Fisher : Okay. Can you just talk a little bit more about what caused that and is it completely done, is there any ongoing risk there? Kevin Berryman : No, we believe that it's effectively done. As a matter of fact, the profitability associated with that project was quite good. And, ultimately, I would say even with that $25 million cost, it was almost pretty close to what we expected to be the margin of the project was when we actually won the award a couple of years ago. So, we're actually unhappy to have those adjustments, but, ultimately, the profitability is very consistent with what our original expectations were on the project. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Hey, thank you, guys. Couple of questions. First, I was wondering, on the bids pipeline, I think you said there was $33 billion in the pipeline. What is the outstanding bids? And if you could talk to what you anticipate in terms of book to bill in the December quarter, maybe just based on where the adjudication timeline is like and how you're thinking the rest of the \u2013 how bookings cadence will kind of play out through the year? Kevin Berryman : So, thanks, Gautam. Just a couple of quick comments. First thing is that there's a couple of very large ones that probably what happened, not now, but into the second or third quarter of our fiscal year. And so, a big chunk of those will probably get to the finish line half years or beyond. And so, there is that $33 billion of chunk that is, I would say, more in the back half than in the front half of the year. And, of course, as you well know in this business, award is granted and then we all see what happens relative to protests and whatnot. And our policy is that we don't book things until we get clear of those protest situations and that oftentimes results in that kind of happening more later as opposed to earlier as it relates to some of these major initiatives.So, I would say, in general, the expectation is second to third quarter is when we start to see things pop as it relates to the book to bill ratios. But, perhaps, I'll turn it over to Bob if he has any additional commentary he'd like to make. Bob Pragada : I think our pipeline is robust and continues to, from a pipeline standpoint, be in the double digit percent year-on-year basis. If I think about a book to bill over the course of the year, I do agree it's going to be higher on the second half, but it won't go below 1. It's going to continue to be on the positive side. Gautam Khanna : Even in Q1, you'd expect it to be above 1? Bob Pragada : I do. Gautam Khanna : Okay. Just unclear, was the $33 billion in outstanding bids number or was that the aggregate of the pipeline? Bob Pragada : That's the available opportunities. Gautam Khanna : Okay. What's actually out there? Do you have that number? Steve Demetriou : As far as projects that we bid? Kevin Berryman : I'm sorry. Gautam, are you saying what's actually been bid versus in the pipeline and we're going after? How do I interpret your question?We've lost Gautam. So, I would say, just make an additional comment about clarity relative to the backlog, certainly, there's a couple large ones that we're in the midst right now as it relates to some of the activities surrounding Hanford. Those are big bids that are coming to fruition near the end of this quarter and into our second quarter fiscal year. We'll see how those play out. But, certainly, those are expecting to get some adjudication in the next three months, we would hope, notwithstanding potential protests. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Michael Dudas : Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thinking about the digital connected enterprise or Jacobs Connected Enterprise and what you're doing to drive that in both lines of businesses, where in 2020 would we see more of the revenue and, I guess, potential margin benefit? Is it from CSM to PPS or vice versa? And on top of that, when you're looking at acquisitions, is that an area where you're really focusing much more on relative to traditional, trying to look at either skill sets on the aerospace or the infrastructure side? Steve Demetriou : Yeah, Michael. Why don't I answer the second one first? The skill sets, I'd say, we're looking for would be more cross cutting and probably focusing more on cyber right now, cyber as well as predictive analytics. As far as which way they're going, it's pretty bilateral right now, is that we're seeing a lot of our cyber expertise that we have within our Critical Mission Solutions, have an effect on what would traditionally be infrastructure projects. And then, going the other way \u2013 well, actually going both ways, our geospatial expertise, utilizing what we have within our Critical Mission Solutions as well as in People & Places for infrastructure as well as for other applications. So, it's pretty bright. It really is the connectivity between both lines of business, is the technology piece. Michael Dudas : And in which areas in either line of business will we see that more benefit as you look at the 2020 plan? Steve Demetriou : I think it will be pretty even. Michael Dudas : Okay. Fair enough. And my follow-up would be, when you're looking at the initial opportunities for 2021, is that assuming because the second half is going to be a little more weighted on the bookings side or there's some economic or company or end market or country specific opportunities that are giving you that much more confidence in the early stage to achieving 2021 target? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : This is Kevin, Michael. Look, I think that clearly the timing of our bookings are more oriented around second quarter and beyond. It's clear relative to that. Doesn't mean that the bookings in Q1 will not be okay. It's just that the upside is more second quarter beyond. And depending upon the timing of the adjudication of those opportunities, it certainly could translate into much more of a stronger booking in the third and fourth quarter than in the first half of the year. And I think that clearly indicates that as we would exist 2020 and into 2021 that we're feeling like we're getting up a set up for our performance in 2020 that will continue to be quite positive relative to our ability to execute against our strategy. So, more to be seen and we'll see how that plays out in terms of the timing, but there is this developing view that the second half is going to end up being pretty strong in terms of the bookings and that, obviously, positions us well for 2021. Steve Demetriou : I think just in the Critical Mission Solutions side, we're excited about some unusually larger opportunities that are in the pipeline, and so the exciting thing is that they are larger than normal, but because of the size that it is going to take a little longer to play out to go through the bid process and hopefully win these. We feel very positive about our positioning on it. So, just building on Kevin's comment, it's why we \u2013 when we\u2019re talking about the pipeline going up, it\u2019s some significant size projects, that will most likely play out in the second half of this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned the bookings and the large opportunity that we could see come through in the second half. Just with your exposure to some of these government agencies and even on municipality side, how do we view this bidding activity as we head into a rather dynamic 2020 election cycle? Does that have any impact on how we should view some of these opportunities in the second half of 2020? Steve Demetriou : Bob, you want to comment on the\u2026 Bob Pragada : Sure. We're actually feeling relatively comfortable, in that on some of the larger opportunities, most of them, we're actually the incumbent. And so, regardless of what happens from the political environment that we sit in today, if those get delayed as a result of \u2013 for whatever reason, we would continue on the work that we have with ongoing task orders. So, that gives a bit of comfort on those. Not totally immune from what happens from a political standpoint, but relatively comfortable. Michael Feniger : That's helpful. And then you addressed the margins in Critical Missions and the mix impact there and how we should think about 2020, just on the operating margins for the People & Places segment, Q4 we saw the strength there. Just going to 2020, looking at your backlogs now, is there anything special we should be aware of in terms of mix on how to think about the operating margins into 2020? Steve Demetriou : Yeah. I think if you look at what we said during investor day on the three-year hurdles, we\u2019re on path to that. We do see from quarter to quarter of bit of seasonality, specifically in the first half, and then that kind of makes its way through and we saw for two consecutive years a bit more robust operating profit margins at the second half of the year. We see that continuing in the next year with the incremental growth when you evaluate it on a year-on-year business. Steve Demetriou : Yeah. I would augment Bob's comment and say, you shouldn't necessarily assume the strength in Q4 as the new norm. Q4 tends to be a very good quarter in this business and tends to be our strongest quarter profile. So, it doesn't mean that we're not going to see some good days over the course of the year, consistent with what our strategic objectives are. But don't necessarily assume that that's the new norm because I think that would be an inappropriate assumption as you think about what the future margin profile, how that will play out over the course of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Berryman : Hi, Chad. Chad Dillard : So, I think, Kevin, you mentioned that the operating cash flow conversion rate, would you exclude all the one-time items, it's about 85% in the fourth quarter, but then I mentioned that kind of the longer-term our target is 1 times. Do you think at any point during 2020 you can get to a 1 times conversion rate if you exclude some of the other one-time items that will occurr in 2020? And just make sure we have our arms around all the one-time items, I think you called it $100 million restructuring, just want to see if there's anything else to be aware of?. Kevin Berryman : No, look, I think just a point of clarification, Chad, to make sure one is understanding. The conversion factor that I was talking about was an adjusted cash flow versus our adjusted earnings base. So, excluding some of the restructuring activities, just to make that clear.The number that I said which was approaching 85% wasn't for the quarter. Actually, the quarter numbers were extraordinarily better than one time in terms the conversion factor. It was associated with the full year numbers on the basis that I just described, So, look, I think that those are things that I think give comfort to us collectively [indiscernible] and certainly are an indication to you that we do have the wherewithal to be able to improve the dynamic going on. Of course, clearly, acquisitions could potentially play into that. We could have other matters that come into the mix that we would have to incorporate into our analytics, but certainly from our perspective we feel like we're well positioned on an underlying operating basis to try to get to those numbers that we've been talking to strategically for certainly the last 9 to 12 months. Chad Dillard : Got it. And just another question for you, Kevin. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about some discrete tax benefits and the impact on 1Q earnings for 2020. I was just hoping you could flush that out on how to think about 1Q earnings seasonally? Kevin Berryman : We don't give guidance specifically by quarter, but I would just make the comment, Chad, that if you take away the $0.09 from our fourth quarter results, go back and look at the normal seasonality that we have Q4 to Q1 because Q1 is our weakest EPS quarter and Q4 is our strongest EPS quarter. So, just be thoughtful as it relates to comparing strong to the weakest, and that has an implication relative to the underling EPS and profitability associated with Q4 to Q1. And I will leave it there. So, just make sure you guys are thoughtful as [indiscernible] it relates to that process. Operator : And that was our final question for today. I will not return the call for presenters. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. So, it's an exciting time for Jacobs, our new brand. We've made a bold change, shaped by our employees, clients, shareholders. Our brands reflects our proud history centered around our belief that we can create a more connected, sustainable world together. Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow. Thank you.

See Slide 2 for more information on the calculation of these pro forma metrics. We have provided historical pro forma results in the appendix of the investor presentation. We believe this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current period performance against prior periods.Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by providing a recap of our financial results and discuss key elements of our strategy. Bob will then review our performance by line of business, and Kevin will provide some in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by an update on our acquisition and ECR divestiture as well as review our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide an updated outlook along with some closing remarks, and then we'll open the call up to your questions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steven Demetriou : Thanks, Jon. Turning to Slide 4. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2020 financial results and the progress we're making executing against our strategy. I continue to reinforce to our key stakeholders that we're on a journey to create a company like no other. Since 2015, we have been transforming our business to a technology-focused solutions company that leverages our global scale, deep technical expertise and now an enhanced brand. At the same time, we've revolutionized our company culture to align our people around one purpose, which is to challenge the accepted and reinvent our thinking to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. The growth opportunities within our core markets are more attractive today than any time in the company's history. We're benefiting from multiple multi-decade growth trends in the areas of water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, urbanization, space exploration, national security and 5G. These are all sectors where we have a distinct competitive advantage. Furthermore, I believe the changes we have made to our culture in the areas of diversity of thought and creating an inclusive environment are in the early phases of being a competitive advantage for Jacobs.From a financial standpoint, we posted a strong start to fiscal 2020. Our backlog grew 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. First quarter adjusted EBITDA pro forma for the KeyW acquisition was up 25%, and adjusted EPS, when excluding the impact of a $0.06 per share discrete tax charge, grew 35%. First quarter free cash flow is in line with our expectations. And we expect strong free cash flow generation for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and beyond as we approach the end of our restructuring efforts related to the strategic actions to transform our business. Discipline around optimizing working capital is a significant focus of our team.From a flexibility standpoint, we maintain a healthy balance sheet that provides the optionality on how we further deploy capital towards high-return investments. We're announcing today an increase to our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion, which is incremental to the remaining $400 million under our prior buyback authorization.Moving to Slide 5. As we continue to transform our business, sustainability is a key ingredient in our vision to become a company like no other. And it aligns squarely with our value of, we do things right, planning beyond our Jacob sustainability strategy that is aligned to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, which was launched a year ago and provides us a great platform to explore the possibilities of reinventing tomorrow, whether it's through how we operate and how we serve our clients, or at home with our families or in the communities where we live and serve.Over the last 12 months, we demonstrated significant progress on that strategy. I want to highlight a couple of actions here. We signed the UN's Global Compact, which commits us to a principle-based approach to doing business in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption, all things that are already part of Jacobs' DNA and value system. We also published our first integrated annual report, reflecting the integral nature of our financials and our sustainability focus and our commitment to robustness and transparency of nonfinancial data. We're developing a Jacobs' climate action plan, which includes a commitment to achieving a net 0 carbon, with a focus on reducing the emissions associated with our business travel and from the facilities we own or operate.As part of our walking the talk is increasing our engagement and thought leadership, ranging from hosting of global sustainability calls with other leaders from government and industry, to participating in this year's World Economic Forum's annual meeting at Davos, where I became co-chair of the Infrastructure and Urban Development Committee, focusing on how the adoption of technology and digital investment in the infrastructure sector can improve productivity and help achieve net 0 carbon emissions to tackle the global climate emergency. And our teams are providing sustainable solutions for our clients around the globe. With projects like SuedLink wind and solar power transmission system in Germany, various high-speed rail projects that help decarbonize transport systems. And on the waterfront, in places like Miami Beach, we are leading the Rising Above climate change resiliency program to combat the impact of catastrophic flooding on infrastructure and business. We're also leveraging our proprietary technology like our flood cloud service for on-demand scenario modeling across all infrastructure types.Climate change is one of the most significant challenges our world is experiencing. And we at Jacobs are making a commitment to work towards solutions through our everyday actions as individuals as well as with our clients and communities.Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada, to discuss the performance of our 2 lines of business. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 6 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. Our Critical Mission Solutions pro forma backlog was up 4% from last year to $8.5 billion, and when accounting for the burn-off of the Hanford Central Plateau Remediation Contract, our CMS backlog increased by high single digits over prior year. The Department of Energy has not yet announced the winner of the Hanford Tank Closure Contract, which is a 10-year $13 billion opportunity.We had a strong first quarter of wins with our international portfolio where we were awarded several notable contracts in support of our nuclear, defense and commercial clients. We expect the momentum we are seeing in the U.K. will carry over to our Wood Group nuclear acquisition that is expected to close before the end of Q2.Moving to our U.S. government sectors, we are aligned to high-priority areas such as mission IT and modernization, space exploration and intelligence, cybersecurity and nuclear remediation, and the spending outlook within our targeted U.S. Federal DoD and related budget is growing in these areas. And on the domestic front, in addition to a solid first quarter, we've had a strong start to the second quarter with 2 large wins in the Department of Defense. One of these was an 8-year $225 million research and development contract for the Air Force; and the other is an 8-year $420 million win, which we'll formally announced in the next coming weeks.From a strategic standpoint, we believe our unique delivery model, which combines strong technical expertise, localized delivery and an efficient cost structure, affords us the ability to take share within targeted sectors while improving profitability to reach the targets we shared at last year's Investor Day. As an example of our highly technical capabilities, we're awarded a Mission Critical win at the Navy's conventional prompt strike test facility to design and develop next-generation testing equipment for air launch and underwater testing of hypersonic weapons systems. This type of strong technical expertise, combined with our track record of executing large enterprise contracts, such as those for the Missile Defense Agency and NASA, presents us with the opportunity to capture incremental, large multiyear awards that are slated for decision over the next 18 months.Moving on to KeyW space intelligence opportunity. We were recently awarded a new multimillion dollar satellite payload, risk reduction and technical maturation program. Due to the highly classified nature of the work, we cannot provide details on specific awards and timing of full rate production. We remain extremely positive on the pipeline of opportunities from multiple customers and expect it to translate into meaningful revenue over the next 12 months. In summary, we're pleased with Critical Mission Solutions performance. And as we look forward, our total pipeline is robust and now stands at a record high, representing a significant year-on-year increase.Now moving on to Slide 7. Our People & Places Solutions business continued to execute on our strategic plan and posted strong first quarter results, with backlog growing 8% year-over-year to $14.2 billion. Our People & Places Solutions business benefits from its alignment to a diversified set of industry sectors that are all seeing structural growth, such as water infrastructure, resiliency and autonomous and AI-driven mobility solutions. We are also seeing strong demand in advanced facilities that are creating the next-generation of semiconductors, biotechnology and cloud computing software. We continue to execute against our market, digital and global connectivity strategy, which allows us to capture higher-value opportunities by leveraging our deep domain expertise with our global integrated delivery centers, serving as a focal point for excellence and innovation at a global scale. As the digital economy matures, clients across our targeted sectors are seeking companies that can help them transform their business, automate operations and enhance operational capacity.Digital capabilities are becoming ingrained in our delivery model, allowing us to leverage those capabilities with domain expertise to sustain our position as an industry leader. For example, Jacobs has partnered with the key clients in the Middle East to develop their smart port expansion master plan, envisioned to expand the port and enhance conventional operations by migrating to automated operations through artificial intelligence and autonomous mobility.Another key part of our digital connectivity strategy is planning for where the market will be a decade from now, whereby advances in neuro network technology or machine intelligence will likely unlock exponential opportunities for us to productize our domain knowledge through software applications. Longer term, we envision a higher percentage of our revenue from technology-enabled solutions, which command higher recurring profitability.Today, we are incubating the first generation of these AI infrastructure solutions. Last quarter, we discussed a cloud-based AI algorithm to auto-score water infrastructure. Within our innovation incubator, we launched Pay V which is a software-as-a-service based asset management solution that optimize air field maintenance, unlocking significant CapEx savings and embedded carbon fit. I'm also excited to talk about a project that combines our expertise in PFAS and digital solutions. We have recently been awarded with projects by an agency in the U.K. to develop a digital risk screening tool to prioritize PFAS investigation of sources across England. These types of solutions can be applied across multiple infrastructure assets and are enhanced by our domain knowledge accumulated from decades of [indiscernible].In summary, we are excited about the near-term and long-term opportunities within our People & Places business, which has a robust sales line -- sales pipeline up more than 30% year-over-year.Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial results in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to switch to Slide 8, where I'll discuss a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. First quarter gross revenue increased 9% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue, including KeyW, up 5%, with 7% growth coming from People & Places and 3% growth from Critical Missions. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 24%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower benefit-related costs. Lower benefit-related costs also reduced unallocated corporate expenses, which I will discuss later.Our adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue fell by 70 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points on a pro forma basis, including KeyW to 15.3%. Again, indicating continued strong cost control and the realization of cost synergies from CH2M and KeyW.GAAP operating profit was up 34% to $151 million and included $51 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges. And $35 million of other charges, consisting of $22 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $13 million of costs associated with the Worley transition services agreements, of which $12 million of those costs were reimbursed and reported in other income. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $237 million, up 28% from the prior year.Moving on, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 8.9%, up 120 basis points year-over-year reported with margin expansion from both lines of business. I'll discuss the underlying drivers by line of business later in my remarks. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $260 million, reaching nearly 10% of net revenue, up 150 basis points year-over-year. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were up substantially to $179 million and $1.33 per share, and included $0.30 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges, as noted above; and a net positive $0.43 per share of other adjustments, consisting mainly of favorable mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake and other ECR-related matters of $0.56, partially offset by intangible amortization of $0.12. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.20, including a $0.06 expense from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year-ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was up 35% year-over-year.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. We are pleased that our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was above 1x for Q1 despite the Hanford plateau contract coming to end of life. We expect that strong bookings trajectory for the remainder of the year.Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 9, and starting with Critical Missions. Pro forma revenue, including KeyW, grew 3% year-over-year during the first quarter. The quarter was impacted by lower procurement revenue, which also supported incremental margin improvement. Operating profit was $90 million and grew 25% year-over-year and in the mid-teens on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%, supported by some project closeout pickups on a nuclear remediation project, and improved margin associated with the lower headwinds from procurement-related revenue noted earlier. In the second half of fiscal 2020, we expect operating profit margin to benefit on a year-over-year basis from our shift to higher-margin, fixed-price services contracts and a higher contribution from the recently acquired KeyW.Perhaps I can make a few comments regarding KeyW. The strategic logic for the acquisition and associated revenue synergies are continuing to indicate an accelerating growth profile later in 2020 and longer term. As we previously announced in October, we won the $40 million a year DC3 cyber contract. In addition, the KeyW mission IT business won a strategic $55 million contract renewal -- a year contract renewal. And as Bob mentioned earlier, the rapid solutions team won a multimillion dollar satellite payload contract. As such, we expect a ramp in revenue and EBITDA growth for the remainder of fiscal 2020.Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q1 net revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and operating profit was up 12%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.1% for the quarter, up 50 basis points from a year ago. The business is benefiting from its alignment to multiple secular growth trends, global scale and a track record of strong project execution and lower risk verticals. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $32 million for the quarter, down 30% year-over-year, supported by lower benefits-related costs, which I previously mentioned were a factor in our gross margin expansion. We remain focused on cost discipline. But as we have previously stated, we will proactively evaluate incremental investments that will support our digital and innovation journey. And as a result, for the remainder of the year, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be near the high end of the previous $25 million to $35 million per quarter guidepost.Finally, we started the year strong in adjusted EBITDA performance, reaching a level of $260 million for the quarter, up 31% year-over-year, reaching nearly 10% of revenue for the quarter, up 150 basis points versus a year ago.So now turning to Slide 10, I would like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Before discussing our most recent efforts, we are pleased that integration of the highly successful CH2M acquisition is largely complete, although some miscellaneous ongoing charges remain for the balance of the year. Cost synergies exceeded our expectations, and revenue synergies continued to deliver higher growth and are serving as a catalyst for our business transformation.Regarding the sale of ECR, to date, we have incurred $206 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction, separation and restructuring costs. We expect the majority of the remaining costs to be incurred by the end of the first half of our fiscal 2020.Regarding KeyW, as of the end of Q1, we effectively achieved the run rate of $15 million in cost synergies, which resulted in our spending $22 million of our estimated $25 million of costs to achieve. To date, we have incurred $13 million of transaction fees and other one-time acquisition-related costs.Finally, our acquisition of Wood's nuclear business remains on track to close in our fiscal Q2. We continue to expect $12 million in annual cost synergies and expect approximately $30 million of transaction costs and cost to achieve synergies.Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 11. During the quarter, free cash flow remained impacted by restructuring-related activities. Reported cash flow was negative $159 million, but improved $86 million versus the year-ago quarter. One should note that our cash flow is normally lighter in Q1 due to seasonality, and it continued to be impacted by approximately $50 million of restructuring and separation-related cash outflows, offset partially by insurance proceeds related to the newly filed settlement and an ECR working capital adjustment. DSOs did increase from Q4 2019 are up slightly year-over-year. We expect to significantly improve collections over the course of 2020 and still see ample opportunities below our DSO run rate over the next 2 years. As a result, for the full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be $450 million-plus, including the impact from cash outflows related to restructuring and separation costs, which we believe will approximate $150 million. Our cash flow will strengthen considerably over the balance of the year.We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $600 million and a gross debt level of $1.6 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA was well less than 1x.Regarding capital deployment, we announced today that we have increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion to a total of $1.4 billion, which represents approximately 10% of our market capitalization. We continue to believe that our shares are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value, and we expect to fully utilize our remaining share buyback authorization over time. For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of approximately $134 million for fiscal year 2020, excluding additional share buybacks. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buyback activity going forward, and we'll provide an update on our quarterly earnings call relative to share count expectations in the future.Including the discrete charge in Q1, we now expect an effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2020, although we continue to believe our normalized tax rate is approximately 24%. given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was previously declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year ago.Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for some closing thoughts on Slide 12. Steven Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. I'm excited about the continued traction of our business transformation. We're seeing a strong inclusive culture developing across Jacobs. Our pipeline is increasing year-over-year with larger, higher-margin opportunities. And we're strategically leveraging our balance sheet, investing in ourselves through timely share backs, as well as disciplined and targeted M&A activities and strong growth sectors.We're maintaining our fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $1.05 -- sorry, $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which includes the net impact from other income and noncontrolling interest. We are also maintaining our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 17% year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from fiscal 2019 discrete tax items. In addition, our guidance also factors in approximately a 6-month benefit from the Wood acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of March.As Kevin outlined, the majority of our restructuring charges are coming to an end, and we are highly focused and confident on delivering strong free cash flow for the remaining 3 quarters of this fiscal year. In summary, we're continuing our discipline, intensity and focus around delivering on our profitable growth strategy and look forward to 2020 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Bob, you talked about the KeyW contract success you've had late. I'm wondering if you could just step back. I think prior to the acquisition, they had talked about around 14 opportunities, greater than $100 million in value, that they had expected to be awarded sometime in 2019. Can you just level set us on how many of those have been awarded? How many have maybe slipped? How many have you won? How many have you lost? Robert Pragada : Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. So really, net-net, we're actually -- we've seen an increase in number of opportunities. So that 14 number that was disclosed last year, has actually grown to north of 20. And then the ins and outs, I'll just put it this way, we're winning more than we're not. But we're also kind of in a -- in an area where we have to consider time as well. The duration of these procurements are -- can be pretty long. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked about the sensor opportunity. I appreciate you can't talk about certain aspects of it. But just high level, can you talk about whether, at this point, the risk is more technical or budget in nature. You feel pretty good that this capability is going to work and perform the mission, it just needs to be funded. Or is there still a fair degree of technical risk ahead of you? Steven Demetriou : Now all these -- this is Steve, Joe. The rapid solutions side of the business is played out as we expected. There are multiple opportunities. Bob reported today that we had a major win in one of them around space intelligence. And these things go through different base gates for the government. And they're just proceeding on making sure they qualify their -- the winners. And obviously, we got a major qualification hurdle behind us, and we're on track for what the model was with regard to entering this space intelligence ISR businesses with the KeyW acquisition. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company. Joshua Sullivan : Can you just give us some color on the backlog here? If you think about margins, you've had some higher value content start to come through. But if you think about margin growth going forward, is it going to be more driven by the type of work that's been won and is in backlog? Or do you see margin growth more from some of these restructuring activities, some operational improvements internally? Steven Demetriou : Yes, I think it's a combination of both. Clearly, you're seeing us become a more and more efficient company. Our G&A as a percent of revenue is clearly contributing to an improved operating profit margin, and we're seeing it across both businesses. But it's also just the transformation of our portfolio, and within the 2 lines of businesses, the work that we're winning. The pipeline is richer in margin. If you look at the Critical Mission Solutions business, it's not only the intelligent asset management and the continued journey of those government projects, but more IDIQ should -- the whole strategy to increase the mix of IDIQ contracts is going to be a margin enhancement. KeyW acquisition is a margin enhancement. When we look at the Wood acquisition compared to our base nuclear business, it's a margin enhancement. So there's a collection in Critical Mission Solutions. And then you have the same story on the People & Places business with regard to the type of projects and programs that we're pursuing and winning in our backlog, but more importantly, in the record pipeline that Bob talked about. Joshua Sullivan : Great. And then just the expectation for DSOs to improve pretty substantially throughout the year. Can you talk about what's driving that? What actions you guys are taking? Kevin Berryman : Could you repeat the question, Josh? Joshua Sullivan : Sorry, just the expectation for DSOs to improve pretty substantially throughout the year. Can you talk about what's driving that? Or how that dynamic's going to work out throughout the rest of the remainder of the year? Kevin Berryman : Yes, a couple of comments. First one is, Q1 tends to be a more challenged quarter on the metric regardless. But notwithstanding that, we're still not satisfied that we're at the levels that we need to be. And similar to last year when we initiated a pretty strong level of actions that were being taken relative to improve our collections over the course of the last three quarters of the year, we're doing exactly the same thing. And so we're focused with our project teams relative to executing against that. We feel comfortable that those teams have clarity and sight going forward as it relates to how to deliver some incremental improvements. And it will be important for us to deliver the cash flow dynamics that we've outlined for the full year. So we're confident that the team is on top of it. We have the task force team in place relative to focusing on those specific areas that we know that we can make some real positive and strong progress on. And so our expectation is we'll start to see that over the course of the next few quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Kevin, I guess, just one follow-up on the cash flow question. I think before, like the Analyst Day last year, you said a big DSO opportunity, I think, was on the CH2M health side. So I'm just wondering, is it acquisition or the legacy Jacobs? And then how do we think about the cadence of free cash flow for the year? Should we assume it's more back-end loaded versus should we start to see the improvement in the March quarter? And are there any sort of onetime items embedded in that north of $450 million to get us to the free cash flow number?And then second question, obviously, you guys announced this morning that you increased your authorization on your share repurchase, which I think the market liked. Is that a message sort of signaling with KeyW and with Wood, that maybe M&A is on the back burner right now, we focus more on sort of integrating those acquisitions and buying back stock. Kevin Berryman : So several questions in that, Jamie. Let me make sure I try and cover them all. First one, on the pace of our cash flow, we do believe that we'll start to see some benefits in Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. So I think that the expectation is consistent with many other years that we have -- the expectation is we should start to see some improvement. So I wouldn't necessarily call it back-half-oriented. I think, clearly, on the $450 million we've identified that there is specific restructuring-related items approaching $150 million. That's included in that $450 million number. So if you were to exclude that, we'd be more along the lines of a $600 million number. So I think that addresses your question on the one-offs.Other than that, clearly, we're going to have to fund the Wood acquisition coming up here in the next couple of months. So that's a one-off. Not in free cash flow, obviously. But certainly, it's one of the uses of cash that we're going to have this year.And the last one, about the authorization and the current number of $1.4 billion what are the implications on potential acquisitions. Look, I think our pipeline of acquisitions continues to be relatively robust. I wouldn't say that we're out of that market by any stretch of the imagination. But by the incremental authorization of $1.4 billion, it's clear that we view that we're -- we have an opportunity to add value by executing against the incremental authorization. So I wouldn't preclude other potential transactions. But I think we're being thoughtful and disciplined in terms of our execution against the share buyback, and we will be opportunistic in that -- on that basis to ensure that we're adding shareholder value. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : You had a nice uptick in CMS margin in the quarter. You said it might have been mostly lower procurement. But is KeyW beginning to have more of an impact on margin? Are these margins in CMS now sustainable? And then is KeyW still supposed to be about $75 million in EBITDA for the year? Kevin Berryman : So first thing on the margin profile. Look, I think the numbers that we have and our expectation is that we will be able to say -- to see year-over-year margin improvement on the CMS business. And so that is ultimately the expectations that we've set for ourselves in the balance of the year for CMS. The team is working hard. Steve alluded to a lot of the things that are already happening relative to going after different contract types, which afford us an ability to have some incremental margin. So we do believe that there is an ability to continue to show some improvements in that margin versus the year-ago figures. So yes, on that.I would say on the KeyW, I think the $75 million, we never really talked about a $75 million number per se. We did talk about the ability of us to ramp up over the course of 2020. And I won't make a specific comment on what the number is, but I can tell you that with the developing pipeline and the new wins that are coming to the forefront, specifically on some of the opportunities that we're really excited about for KeyW, I think we're going to see some momentum in the back half of the year as those things come into the portfolio and we start to burn some of the revenue against that. So perhaps a little bit back-end -- more back-ended, but we're really excited nonetheless. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Kevin, can I follow-up on the $600 million in cash flow in '20 in the sense that -- I think you've said this before, sort of mid-80% conversion on adjusted EPS. If I go out into '21, I know it's a long time away, but would you assume that really of the noise, or should I say the onetime items, are behind you for the most part, and you get conversion closer to the 100% average that Jacobs has done over the last many years? Kevin Berryman : I think that as we've characterized to all of you, we believe that there is an opportunity for Jacobs to deliver a higher level of conversion on cash flow than certainly we did in 2019. But we all know that there was a lot going on in that particular year.The $150 million that we've talked about in terms of restructuring and onetime efforts, which are kind of tail-end of the substantive transformation that we've been executing against, certainly, are going to be reduced to a significant level by the end of, not only this year, but kind of more along the lines of our first half of the year. So look, we're not necessarily done per se, if, in fact, we are going to be talking about acquisitions, and we do think there's a strategic opportunity, there will obviously be some onetime costs. But I think we're talking in a more measured level versus what we've seen, historically speaking, because the transformation of the integration of CH and the exit of the ECR business were fundamentally large, transformative issues that we had to work through over the last couple of years all at the same time. So our idea -- our view and idea is that as we go forward, it's going to be a little more clear, a little bit more focused. And consequently, the one-off restructuring or opportunities associated with our growth initiatives will be more focused and less robust than what they have been in the past in terms of restructuring-related costs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Jeffrey Molinari : This is Jeff Molinari on for Gautam. So I got a couple of questions on CMS. How big is the current bid pipeline? And what is the dollar value for bids submitted that are waiting decision? Robert Pragada : Yes. So our dollar pipeline is in excess of $35 billion right now, and about 1/4 of those have been submitted. Probably the better news is that, that is up almost fourfold from this time last year. Jeffrey Molinari : Okay. And then what do you anticipate for the book-to-bill to be in the March Q? Do you think you can continue your streak above 1x? Kevin Berryman : Look, it really -- it's tough to really forecast an exact book-to-bill. Obviously, given the pipeline that's been talked about, our expectation is our book-to-bill improves over the balance of the year with some of these very large opportunities. We feel very good about coming to fruition. So we don't -- won't quote a specific number, but we certainly expect that it'll be improving versus our Q1 numbers. Jeffrey Molinari : Okay. And what percent of 2020 sales are up for recompete? Are there any chunky contracts worth calling out? Robert Pragada : Besides the one we've talked about quite a bit on the Hanford Tank Closure Contract, I think that's probably the one that we're obviously very focused in on. Kevin Berryman : Yes. We have a new bid for the Hanford tank and we historically had the Central Plateau remediation contract, which is a rebid that's in the process of being protested. Jeffrey Molinari : Okay. And then the last question is, I think you mentioned the guidance includes 6 months of Woods. Was that the case previously? Or I might have missed that. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Just a question on People & Places Solutions. You folks have had really steady, sustained growth, even though the end markets have been a bit choppy over the past couple of years. Can you just talk about where your win rates are today compared to historical levels? Is it -- are you having more success on the bids that you're submitting with a wider service offering? Or what would you attribute the sustained outperformance hereto when you think about it in terms of win rates and project selection? Robert Pragada : Yes, it's kind of all of you above, Jerry. So our win rate has dramatically gone up over the course, I'd call it, 24 months, and is north of 50% right now. Two ways of looking at it. One is that maybe we're not bidding enough work. That's not the case. But we're bidding in an area from a technical consulting and technical solutions area where our solution is differentiated. And so we attribute that to the win rate. On your other question with regards to the opportunities, we're actually seeing -- it's a pretty opportunity-rich environment right now across the globe. And so there's no shortage of activity from a bid as well as a win rate, and I think you're seeing it in the lagging indicators with regards to the financials. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then a question on the balance sheet, Kevin. So unbilled receivables plus contract assets were up $70 million sequentially in the first quarter. They were up $200 million last year. Is that just working through contracts from businesses that were acquired? Or can you give us some more context? Because clearly, based on the guidance, you're going to convert that into cash over the balance of the year. I'm wondering if you just build our comfort level on how concentrated that is and what's that related to. Kevin Berryman : Yes, there's a couple larger contracts where it can be a little bit lumpy as it relates to how those things come to fruition. We're confident that given that lumpiness, some of that lumpiness will reverse over the course of the next couple of quarters, specifically. So we're feeling pretty good about it. And that's one of the reasons that we're pretty excited about the balance of the year cash flow. And so at the end of the day, we're on it. We're focused. And the team is -- I'm confident is going to execute against it. Jerry Revich : And Kevin, what are the milestones? And are the projects on time so far? Any additional color that you can share? Robert Pragada : Sorry, Jerry, milestones with regards to those potentially what we got, is that what you're referring to? Jerry Revich : Yes. So in other words, when can we change unbilled receivables or contract assets into billed receivables and eventually collect cash. So what are the milestone dates that we have to complete on those contracts to be able to issue the invoice, if you will? Robert Pragada : Yes. And so it's right in line with what Kevin said, it's within the next couple of quarters. So that improvement that we're seeing over Q2, Q3 and the balance of the year, those milestones fit right within that time frame. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Steve, in your -- in your prepared remarks, you talked quite a bit about climate change. And I think most people have been noticing, at least I had, over the last several months, even weeks, a lot more visibility, a lot more concern, a lot more companies talking about it. Can you -- is it more from a government standpoint? Are you having your private client customers engaging on these solutions? And in PPS, when do you think we'll start to see noticeable like wins or announcements that will start to drive -- I'm sure this is better margin, but better work through that segment? Steven Demetriou : Yes. So just use the World Economic Forum at Davos just in the last couple of weeks as a barometer. It was clear that it was across all sectors. Government sectors, the politicians that are there, the commercial CEOs, on a global basis. It felt like coming out of this at Davos, that there was a huge shift, and this is something that we got to carefully look at over the next several years to a crisis that everybody's on top of and committed to. So I think it's transitioned now to be a major issue and opportunity for us at Jacobs. We're developing our own plan to be at net 0 carbon neutral at some point in the future. And more importantly, we're already winning business, and we're already in the mix of being a solutions player on a global basis. We announced over the last year, 1.5 years, projects like the Miami Beach sea level rise, what we're doing in London around the Thames River. And you name it, any major city, whether it's San Francisco or all the way to Singapore, the type of things we're doing to address climate changes is we're viewed as a solutions provided by our clients.Clearly, higher-margin opportunities, and it's across the board. We're not only going in with traditional solutions, but we're going in with innovative solutions, using artificial intelligence and digital capabilities to address these issues in a much more efficient, innovative way. And as a result, we're -- we got a high win rate as we pursue these opportunities across the globe. Michael Dudas : And I assume that's for a lot of the internal investment, at least, that you talked about relative to 2020 beyond adding the talent and scope and solutions on that front? Robert Pragada : Yes, absolutely, Mike. We -- clearly, the human capital element is a big piece of that. If you look at our demographics right now, the age demographic probably stands out as -- I'd just say, in the last 10 years, that number has dropped by 10 years. And then from a technology standpoint, we're putting some real investment in simulation tools, whether they be simulation tools around flood plains and flood control, all the way to water resiliency and even coastal protection. We just were awarded, and I know this has been announced, the -- it's called Project Orange. It's the coastal restoration for the Gulf Coast starting in Galveston and going all the way through the Gulf of Mexico. And the technology that we're utilizing in order to build those solutions is really impressive. So more to follow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Michael Feniger : If I could just circle back on your comments before, that you will still be in the M&A market. I mean, can you flesh that out a little more? You mentioned how your stock and the intrinsic value there. How are you seeing multiples moving in the pipeline, when we look at the defense and the people segment over the last few quarters? Steven Demetriou : Well, from an M&A standpoint, I think Kevin said it exactly right. Our first priority is our own stock. That's why we just announced the $1 billion stock buyback. We still see Jacobs as being one of the best, if not the best, use of our capital over the near term, based on what we see our organic runway and the path forward for the company.We're staying core to our strategic plan that we announced a year ago with regard to things like strengthening our capability and digital consulting, or selective geographic expansion, gaining more bolt-on capabilities around innovation and technology. And so the things like KeyW and Wood, most recently, were more in the form of bolt-on strategic enhancements to our ability to have upsized organic growth. And I think that's what you'll see us continue to be focused on over the near term. We have the luxury of being highly selective because of our ability to redeploy our capital against -- to Jacobs. And so any acquisition that we make over the next few years, it's going to be benchmarked against the alternative of buying our stock back, so it has to be superior value. Michael Feniger : Fair enough. And when we think of defense, in the private market, we've seen a lot of activity there to really drive scale. If we look at the design and consulting side for environment, water, transportation, how important is scale there in the industry? Obviously, CH2M has been a success. I'm just hoping you could talk about scale and how that benefits in that fragmented industry right there. Robert Pragada : The scale definitely helps and scale matters. But I would probably characterize it as a -- it's one of a few key criteria. It's not scale by itself, it's scale, coupled with technical expertise, coupled with technology-enabled solutions. And so we see all of that really as the driver, not scale-for-scale purposes. Steven Demetriou : I want to build on that because I think that's been a key ingredient to our success at Jacobs with our acquisition strategy. A lot of companies make acquisitions that double the size of an industry, but it's -- there's a lot of overlap. And as a result, there's all kinds of cultural disconnects that get created, and we've seen those around the industry for the last decade. CH2M was a perfect example of a complementary acquisition. Yes, it did give us scale, but more importantly, it kind of filled in the hole that we didn't have. So it was water, strengthening our environmental, our Tier 1 nuclear and a whole host of other things. And as a result, it was more of a diverse offering that gave our clients more of a one-stop shop at Jacobs that I would just put more in the area of value and diversity rather than scale group. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Just to continue on the last discussion topic there around scale. Of course, a lot of chatter recently around consolidation in the design and engineering space. I'd just be curious to get your sense on, from a competitive perspective, what the emergence of another kind of mega-player through a combination would mean competitively for Jacobs? Would there be potential threat there? Or on the flip side, potential opportunities emerging? Steven Demetriou : Yes, it really depends, again, on what that combination leads to. If it's a combination that two companies or two entities get together, and there's just a lot of overlap, that will be a positive for us. There'll be talent opportunities. There'll be disruption. There'll be culture challenges that impact those kind of acquisitions. Consolidation is also a positive from a standpoint that as industries get fewer competition, although stronger, there's positives out of that. So clearly, we're not saying that there's no threat of those type of combinations if they occur. But at the end of the day, our view is that it isn't about scale, it's about value, it's about differentiation, it's about matching that up with a culture of execution and innovation and accountability, all the things that we've been demonstrating over the last 4 years. And so we'll stay close to what happens out there in the industry, but it really depends on what that looks like. Sean Eastman : Okay, that's helpful. And next one for me is just on this transition at the DOE Hanford site. It's come up a few times on the call today. I'm just curious, it seems like the tank's contractor selection process has been a little more protracted than expected. And I'm just wondering, given this is the one kind of big recompete this year, how we should be thinking about this plateau versus tanks dynamic and timing relative to what's built into the 2020 guidance? Steven Demetriou : Yes, I think there's not a lot of risk for us over the short-term in our guidance for Hanford. And for us, playing out so far, we'll see what the outcome is as we expected. As we said, in our previous calls that we did pursue both plateau and tanks, but we decided to be a sum or -- we didn't move into the prime position in plateau and really put all our efforts around teaming up with a great partner in pursuing tanks where we believe we could offer something unique and innovative to the client. And so as far as how it plays out, there is uncertainty of whether it's a month away or 6 months away. And I think that they're trying to finalize the plateau initiative. There's a protest going on in that initiative that probably has stalled tanks. Whether it's a 1-month stall or something that will be several months, we don't know, but we're not -- it's going to be immaterial to our 2020 results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Chad Dillard : So you guys talked about going after different contract types and CMS, which would ultimately drive your margins upward. I just want to get a little bit more color on that. Can you talk about just what different capabilities you need? Are you potentially seeing new competitors in that new landscape? And just talk about the progress thus far on achieving that? Robert Pragada : Sure. Just before answering directly, just a little bit of a backdrop, and it kind of applies to M&A as well, but specifically on the contract type. If you remember, back in our Investor Day, this was a defined element of our strategy. And so the capabilities, in order to go up the value chain, coupled with the systems and project delivery know-how on how to deliver fixed price work, we have, and we've had for years. We're probably not as aggressive on converting what historically was cost-reimbursable-type work into fixed price task orders. And now, that initiative is in full force.From a competitive perspective, we're not alone. So the competition is also going down the same path. We're pretty confident that we have an edge in that because of the entirety of our business even beyond CMS into PPS, it's kind of embedded in our roots on how to deliver great projects. So but we're confident that this is something that's going to take hold. And like we said back -- last February, it's going to be about a 12 to 24 month period for us to get that as a material part of our portfolio, but we're on the right path. Chad Dillard : That's helpful. And just a question on the quarter. Just in terms of the core free cash flow of the business. And I'm sorry if I missed it, you mentioned it earlier. Can you just talk about like what that was? And then hopefully, you can bridge that to what the actual headline number was. And then secondly, on CMS margins, I think there may have been a closeout. Any possibility of quantifying that would be great. Kevin Berryman : We won't go into the details, but certainly, the -- taking your second question first. The margin pickup was a chunk of the incremental benefits we had. The idea, though, as it relates to what Bob was talking about in terms of the other margin improvement initiatives, we feel, are taking hold and gaining traction as it relates to the balance of the year. So that's perhaps that one.As it relates to the cash flow, cash flow is kind of in the neighborhood in Q1 of negative $150 million. And there was a couple of pluses and minuses in that number. So if you look at the headline number, our underlying was probably pretty close to the same number. Clearly, we had restructuring that was part of that, but we also had some benefits as it relates to ECR-related adjustments on working capital, which was a positive. And then we also had some insurance proceeds that was associated with the newly found matter. So at the end of the day, pretty close to being the same number. And I think that, that translates into us being able to leverage off of what that underlying number is, focused on ability to deliver incremental improvements and collections. And we're feeling pretty good about the balance of the year. Operator : Your last question comes from Andrew Wittman with Baird. Andrew Wittmann : I'm going yield the floor. All of my questions have been asked and answered. Operator : Okay. And there are no further questions queued up at this time. Steven Demetriou : All right. Thank you. The most exciting part of where we are as a company is the momentum that we've generated by our people's belief and commitment in what we're doing and where we're headed. At the end of the day, we're a people business. To be the employer of choice in a highly competitive marketplace, genuine engagement and buy-in from our people is critical. Our focus on global challenges that are important to us as human beings as well as important to each and every one of our client is a key part of that engagement and commitment. The return is visible every day through the innovative solutions we're delivering for our clients. Our people really are reinvesting for tomorrow. Thank you very much.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.I will now turn the call over to your host, Jonathan Doros. Please go ahead, sir. Jonathan Doros : Good evening to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this evening and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation and prepared remarks to our website, which we will reference during the call. I'd like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is summarized on slide 2.Certain statements contained in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided by the same. Statements made in this presentation and an update on historical facts are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make concerning the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our expectations as to our future growth, prospects, financial outlook and business strategy for fiscal 2020 or future fiscal years.

Please see slide 2 of the presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we'll discuss comparisons of current results to prior periods on a pro forma basis. Please see slide 2 for more information on the calculation of these pro forma metrics. We have provided historical pro forma results in the appendix of the investor presentation. Please note that due to the timing of the Wood Nuclear acquisition in March, the current and prior period impacts of the Wood Nuclear business have been excluded when discussing pro forma comparisons.We believe this information helps provide additional insight into the underlying trends of our business when comparing current performance against prior periods.Now turning to the agenda on slide 3. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Jacobs Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou, President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Pragada and President and Chief Financial Officer Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by discussing our climate action commitments, then provide a update on our response to COVID-19 pandemic and then recap of our financial results and updated outlook, Bob will then review our performance by line of business and Kevin will provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by an update on our acquisitions and ECR divestiture, as well as review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide detail on updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we\u2019ll open the call for your questions.With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steven Demetriou : All right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our fiscal year second quarter results.Before I get started, I wanted to share our recent announcement on our launch of Jacobs\u2019 Climate Action Plan. Even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain focused on delivering on our strategy and advancing our purpose of creating a more connected, sustainable world.We often say, we are a people business at Jacobs, which is why we must take actions that help sustain the world within which we all live. Jacobs\u2019 first Climate Action Plan sets us apart capturing the shared passion, pride and drive of our people, as we work to preserve the planet for future generations.The launch of this plan is another major milestone in our cultural and company transformation. Our collective focus on developing and delivering on our strategy, including a deliberate portfolio of transformation brings us to this important juncture. Together we are committing to 100% renewable energy and Net Zero Carbon by the end of 2020, with a long-term commitment to be carbon negative by 2030.Moving forward, we want to leverage our depth of expertise and leading position in the industry to work with our clients and our supply chain to drive climate resiliency into our solutions, investing together in projects that drive profitable reduction in carbon emissions. This is an exciting milestone in the company\u2019s history, and a course that we can take pride in delivering on together as we reinvent our tomorrow.Now turning to slide 5. Our new brand, Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow, has served as a strong galvanizing driver as we navigate through the COVID-19 environment. Throughout the past 8 weeks we have challenged the way in which we work and the markets we face and in the process, we are reinventing our tomorrow real-time through growth opportunities for our people and innovative offerings for our clients.From the outset of the pandemic, our focus has been the safety and well-being of our people, maintaining business continuity and delivering on our commitments to our clients.We mobilized a global, cross functional COVID-19 Critical Response Team led by our Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada to address both internal and external COVID-19 related challenges, with Regional Response Teams charged with rapid action on the ground.As soon as we learned that global travel was shown to be at the root of the continued spread of the virus and physical distancing was critical to flattening that curve, we took early, immediate and decisive action to restrict travel and to maximize remote working. Except for mission-critical employees, all of our people have been successfully working remotely over the last two months.Proactive, engaging and transparent employee communications has been critical. From the outset, I immediately started a regular cadence of communication with our employees globally. This included a daily executive leadership team meeting, a weekly global email message from me at the beginning of each week to all employees. And a live mid-week virtual Town Hall so that my executive leadership team and I can connect real-time with our teams around the globe.We also expanded our intranet, and equipped our leaders with tools to send short, personal video messages to their people. Over communication was and remains an imperative.As we shifted from office to home, we took our strong BeyondZero safety culture with us to create and maintain a safe working environment for our teams. As part of that, positive mental health is paramount, and we increased our offerings of mental health tools and techniques and mobilized our more than 1800 Jacobs Positive Mental Health Champions around the world.A certain portion of our business is essential and mission critical to governments and private sector clients where our staff continue to work on site. In these cases, we worked closely with our clients and established project-specific plans to ensure the safety of our people and the integrity of the operation.I have been so impressed with the success we have had in accelerating our digital transformation, investing in optimizing our networks and leveraging technology to facilitate collaboration and more flexible working scenarios for our people, while at the same time delivering on our commitments to our clients.Coming out of this pandemic we will have validated different work approaches, with less reliance on extensive travel and physical real estate, and with the potential for significantly reduced cost and carbon footprint. We are currently in the process of planning a safe return to our workplaces, how, when, and in some cases if, while at the same time advancing our strategy of our future of work. We will share more about this in our next earnings call.Early on during this pandemic, we leveraged our capabilities to become part of the COVID-19 solution. As our customers transitioned to remote working, we helped plan and execute those shifts, including support in assessment of cyber security implications.Materials and 3-D printing equipment were redeployed to help the frontline care workers with PPE. Existing federal and local government framework contracts around the globe were leveraged for action planning and implementation of healthcare facilities, including contracts for the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA and the Governments of U.K., Australia and New Zealand;Our Life Sciences teams were tapped for designing facilities that will ultimately produce COVID-19 vaccines or other therapies. And on the innovation side of the issue, we have two teams addressing different critical challenges. To better understand the spread of the Coronavirus, our teams are launching a pilot program to monitor wastewater streams using digital tools to help provide actionable COVID-19 insights and data to our clients.Our technologists are busy considering what it means for building owners when shelter in place orders are lifted and buildings that sat vacant for weeks or months may cause problems of their own such as legionella, lead contamination and poor air quality.Our teams have developed guidance for schools, offices and other public and private spaces to help them safely re-open and prepare for reentry. We believe that the positive impact on our culture over the past four years and our transparent and measured behaviors during this crisis has solidified loyalty with our employees, resulting in increased structural talent retention which will unlock more investment dollars for innovation and growth.As we turn to s6 to further discuss our business resiliency. As it relates to our people, we have purposely maintained our workforce capacity to position us strongly for a recovery after physical distancing subsides.By strategically aligning our portfolio to a diverse set of high value sectors such as; national security, water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, healthcare and life sciences, intelligent asset management, space exploration and the convergence of information and operational technology, we have significantly increased the durability and growth opportunities of our business under multiple economic scenarios and the expected new norm in the aftermath of COVID-19.In parallel with our portfolio transformation, we invested in digital technology to further expand our global integrated delivery model. This provides the ability to rapidly flex our deep technical expertise to accommodate any scenario around changes to global versus localized demand.Equally as important, we have created a powerful inclusive culture, which we believe unleashes the ability to execute more effectively versus our competitors when adjusting to changing market dynamics.From a financial standpoint this strategy has demonstrated strong results over the last few years and that track record of performance continued in our fiscal second quarter with pro forma backlog up 5% and pro forma net revenue up 7.5% year-over-year.Second quarter adjusted EBITDA also grew year-over-year and after a correction in the third quarter we expect it to improve in our fiscal fourth quarter. Equally as important and in-line with our previous outlook, we delivered positive free cash flow in the quarter and expect strong free cash flow for the remainder of the year.That the physical distancing constraints from COVID-19 have resulted in some near-term headwinds impacting the current third quarter as we and our customers adjust to a new working environment. However, we view these headwinds as temporary. As a result, we would expect the business to ramp up to run-rate levels over the next six-months as the structural drivers of our business are strong and our sales pipeline remains robust.We have proactively positioned our capacity to capitalize on this new normal environment by retaining talent and maintaining key investments. We believe these actions position Jacobs for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth in fiscal 2021.Finally, we have strong financial flexibility with ample liquidity that can be prudently deployed toward high return opportunities.Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued to perform well with total backlog now $9.1 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis.Growth was driven by sizeable new business wins with the Navy to deliver intelligent asset management, and with the Air Force for research and development of rocket and propulsion technology, as well as two smaller but strategic wins for cyber assessment solutions for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and a develop and operations contract with the FBI\u2019s electronic laboratory. Overall, Q2 performance was in-line with our expectations for the business.As a part of the overall financial scenario planning for the company, we believe the crisis will have a short-term impact on our CMS business, with 90% of the temporary decline we are currently experiencing due to the impact of physical distancing associated with COVID-19.The underlying structural demand for our services remains strong and as a result we expect business to ramp up as we approach the end of our fiscal year and expect continued growth in fiscal \u201821 and beyond.Our CMS business is supported by long term, enterprise contracts. Unlike other parts of our CMS portfolio which can be executed virtually, these contracts involve highly technical work, such as Department of Energy remediation and Department of Defense test ranges, where access to the client\u2019s site is required. Some elements of these stable and resilient contracts are experiencing temporary impacts from physical distancing protocols.Let me now share with you further details on the impact by sector. Our US Federal Civilian business makes up approximately 40% of CMS revenue, with a majority coming from our NASA and DOE clients.Jacobs provides broad support to NASA in its accelerated work to meet the current Administration\u2019s mandate to return to the moon in 2024. Our client must make progress toward these national goals despite the challenges of teleworking and a reduced on-site workforce. At NASA we expect a low overall impact in the second half of the year as most of our work transitioned to teleworking or operating within physical distancing guidelines.However, we anticipate our DOE and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited nuclear contracts to be impacted to a greater degree in the second half of the year, as Jacobs teams are operating under physical distancing constraints that significantly decrease the on-site workforce.While DOE has provided us the ability to recoup the direct cost from the idle work force, our operating profit is generated on a performance incentive milestone basis. As a result, we expect to recognize revenue from these customers at a lower profitability until we ramp back to normal operating levels, which is expected later this fiscal year.I want to note that this part of our business continues to win awards in this tough environment. In April we were awarded a 39-month extension of DOE\u2019s West Valley Demonstration Project. West Valley is just one of the five extensions we have recently been awarded for our ten project sites.In the event of a continuing economic slowdown our nuclear remediation will be one of the most resilient components of our portfolio given the well-funded long-term recurring nature of the business.Now moving to the US Intelligence Community which contributes just over 20% of CMS revenue. Our Mission IT, C5ISR, and Cyber businesses provide solutions to this sector. Our clients in the Intelligence Community must continue to provide these critical services, remaining resilient in the face of increased cyber-attacks, and preserve continuity of operations, while responding to the sudden need to reduce on-site workforces.Overall, we see a moderate impact from physical distancing headwinds at sites that require split shifts in secured facilities. We expect the impact to dissipate as we approach the end of the fiscal year. This is partially offset by continued strong performance in our Cyber and Mission-IT business.Moving on, the US Department of Defense makes up approximately 20% of CMS revenue where we provide a wide range of mission critical services performed at government sites or in highly secure facilities. Our work at the Missile Defense Agency continues to operate at near normal run-rates, however much of our work at the army\u2019s test ranges have been impacted by physical distancing requirements.In line with our nuclear remediation business, these are highly resistant, well-funded, I am sorry, high resilient, well-funded long-term programs that perform well in economic uncertainty but require on-site execution by our employees. Similar to the intelligence community our cyber work within our DOD portfolio remains strong. We expect COVID-19 to have a moderate impact to our second half results within our Defense business but normalize as we approach the end of our fiscal year.CMS International makes up about 10% of the business, which covers primarily Tier-1 nuclear decommissioning, and operations and maintenance services in the U.K. and Europe. Our international business also supports the U.K. Ministry of Defence on its Continuous At-Sea Deterrence program, and various sustainment programs for air and land defense in the UK and Australia.We expect our International business to be moderately impacted from COVID-19 in the second half of the year with approximately 70% of the impact coming from field work interruptions and 30% from consulting delays, but returning to normalized run-rate as we exit the fiscal year.Shifting to our commercial business, this makes up approximately 10% of CMS revenues. In telecom, we provide solutions for wireless and wireline networks including the buildout of 5G. We expect this sector to remain strong over the next several years.For the automotive sector, we primarily design and operate aerodynamic wind tunnels and provide general technical services, engineering, and testing of automotive engines. This business is being temporarily impacted by physical distancing and we expect new awards to be delayed as our clients re-evaluate their CapEx portfolio and future demand requirements.In summary, we continue to believe the COVID-19 impact on our CMS business to be temporary and not indicative of how the business would perform in a typical recession scenario. We are aligned to high-priority, mission critical areas of federal government budgets and our overall 2021 sales pipeline remains robust at more than $37 billion. Of this figure, we currently have over $17 billion in source selection, with a blended profitability above our current run-rate.Moving to our People and Places Solutions Business on slide 8. Our P&PS business continued its strong track record of performance in the second quarter with backlog up 5.4%. Q2 net revenue, excluding pass-throughs, was up10% year-over-year. We had several wins in the quarter that further validate our strategy to align the business to a diverse set of high priority public and private sector initiatives in resilient geographies.A recent selection as the prime consultant for a major U.S. Navy Environmental contract, expected to be a $480 million in fee over 5 years, underscores Jacobs\u2019 proven program management, environmental and PFAS expertise. We also continue to drive technology-enabled solutions across all facets of the portfolio.As an example, we were awarded what will be the largest PFAS groundwater treatment pilot program in the U.S. with Orange County, CA, drawing on our multidisciplinary capabilities across all markets. And in our water business we won a 20-year O&M program for the City of Wilmington Delaware, which will leverage predictive analytics to optimize operations.In addition, we recently leveraged our deep domain expertise to win a software development contract for the U.K.\u2019s national flood risk assessment and also won a mandate to deploy our AquaDNA software analytics solution at one of the world\u2019s largest water utilities.As evidenced by these superior client solutions, our strategic initiatives around global, market and digital connectivity are the basis for our continued double-digit profit growth trajectory over the last 18-months.Now, I will discuss how we expect COVID-19 to impact our P&PS business from a geographic and industry sector standpoint. Before doing so, I\u2019d like to discuss how we have not only adapted but optimized our delivery amidst COVID-19.Our distributed workforce has maintained business continuity, while generating accelerated opportunities for innovation. We continue to deliver world-class consultancy and design with the majority of staff working from home, while also utilizing video streaming, augmented reality, and other innovative techniques to perform site assessments, inspections and assist in equipment maintenance and plant operation, linking our experts globally to provide solutions in real-time. Our digitized project delivery platform has created increased efficiency and has enhanced our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions.Now to our buildings and infrastructure geographies, starting with the Americas, including our Federal business. This business comprises more than 50% of our P&PS net revenue. Going into the fiscal third quarter, I am sorry, going into third fiscal quarter of FY20, the Americas is one of our best performing regions with strong double-digit top and bottom-line growth across multiple sub-geographies and sectors.We continue to see healthy sales bookings activity even considering COVID-19 pressures, with some delays in new awards, but minimal cancellations at this point. However, our revenue burn rate is expected to decrease modestly in the second half.We are strategically maintaining a slightly higher cost structure, in retaining our talent in anticipation of a return to a more normalized demand level and potential U.S. infrastructure stimulus. Overall, we expect the Americas to experience a minimal COVID-19-based impact year-over-year, but a more pronounced impact compared to our growth expectations. Forward looking indicators imply improved conditions as we approach our fiscal year end.Turning to Europe and the Middle East, this geography represents approximately 20% of P&PS net revenue, with the U.K. making up the majority of the business. Prior to COVID-19 the U.K. was experiencing Brexit related slowdowns as the newly elected government was in the process of formalizing their plan for increased infrastructure investment and restarting major programs which were awaiting funding.Through our diverse offering, track record of performance and scale, we are uniquely engaged in all major infrastructure programs in the U.K. In fact, we were just awarded a 10-year Highways England Smart Motorways Alliance contract. High-Speed 2 is also moving forward, along with a pipeline of smaller projects within existing framework agreements. However, we are cautious on our near-term expectations for a broader post-COVID-19 ramp up in this geography and expect a moderately negative impact to results in fiscal Q3, improving modestly during fiscal Q4.Longer-term, we view Europe and the Middle East as strategic geographies that will not only prioritize infrastructure spending but will also serve as an innovation hub for the latest digital infrastructure solutions.Moving to Asia, which represents just under 10% of P&PS net revenue with Australia and New Zealand comprising the majority of that business. While the pipeline of new opportunities remains robust, we are witnessing delays in some aviation related and other projects tied to government tax revenue associated with the downturn in commodities.We expect Asia to be materially impacted in fiscal Q3 2020 and improve as we reposition our resources targeting developing opportunities in healthcare facilities and transportation.And finally, our Advanced Facilities business, which makes up approximately 20% of P&PS net revenue, will likely see the most pronounced COVID-19-related impacts for the business in the short-term given physical distancing constraints at some of our sites.A key factor is our Life Sciences customers realigning their capital portfolio to COVID-19-related solutions and changes in supply chain strategies related to other therapies. We believe this business has the most potential for a sharp V-shaped recovery driven by multiple large scale COVID-19-related therapies and vaccine projects in the pipeline, where we are well positioned as the global leader.In fact, we are currently performing early conceptual designs for these life sciences and mission critical projects. In addition, cloud computing driven projects such as semiconductor fabs and data centers are likely to be awarded in the coming months.Our advanced facilities business is one of the areas we are the most optimistic about with the developing momentum we expect to play out over the course of 2021 and beyond.As we turn to our core sectors, while global restriction in mobility has resulted in reduced demand across all modes of transportation, much of the market\u2019s critical infrastructure projects have been sustained through recent government stimulus packages. We anticipate that future transportation-related stimulus will catalyze and drive economic recovery.Moving to the water and environmental sector, we are seeing strong long-term demand in both upgrades to water infrastructure and our utility operations and maintenance business. From an environmental standpoint our PFAS and FEMA-related businesses are expected to grow, partially offset from short-term impact from physical distancing in our field work and private sector environmental consulting.And in our built environment, which includes government facilities, healthcare, higher education, and smart cities, we anticipate near-term headwinds to be offset by solid demand in healthcare as clients rethink their evolving resiliency requirements.We also expect a growing demand from our higher-education and sports and entertainment clients reshaping their infrastructure preparedness for the threat of future pandemics.In summary, we have taken a proactive approach to assessing the shifting market trends into a living roadmap, we call the Now to Next initiative. This initiative, along with our proven track record of execution, reinforces our global, market and digital connectivity strategy.Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Kevin? Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. I am now going to discuss more detailed summary of our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on slide 9.Second quarter gross revenue increased 11% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue including KeyW, but excluding the stub period from three weeks of Wood Nuclear, up 7.5%, with 10% growth coming from P&PS and 4% growth from CMS.Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the success in delivering our cost synergy targets for the CH2M acquisition, as some of that benefit has accrued to our clients via lower overhead reimbursement rates in some contracts.The lower reimbursement rate, of course, is more than offset by the absolute lower level of G&A costs. The impact remains a net positive to the company. That is exhibited by the lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.8%.It was also positively impacted by lower travel and employee related costs associated with some early impacts from COVID-19 cost mitigation efforts. In short, the improved G&A level as a percent of Net Revenue continues to show improved growth leverage for the company.GAAP operating profit was up 63% to $168 million and included $44 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, and $24 million of other charges consisting of $22 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, and $2 million of costs associated with the Worley transition service agreementsAdjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $237 million, up 7% from the prior year. Moving on, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 8.5%, down 50 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by a decrease in CMS, flat performance in PPS, and higher unallocated corporate expense. I\u2019ll discuss the underlying drivers for the lines of business and corporate costs on the next slide.GAAP Net Earnings and EPS from continuing operations were a negative $122 million or $0.92 per share and included, a charge for the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake and other ECR related matters of $1.94, $0.25 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges as noted above, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.12.Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.39, including a $0.07 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was up 11% year-over-year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $261 million, or 9.4% of net revenue, and met our expectations for the quarter.Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio approached 1.1 for Q2, driven by a strong CMS book to bill of approximately 1.2 times and a solid 1x book to bill for P&PS. As Bob noted earlier, the sales pipeline remains robust across both lines of business and has increased on a like for like basis when compared to last year and last quarter.While we have seen some delays in expected award dates, we have seen very few cancellations. We continue to be optimistic that our pipeline will convert in a manner that will set the company up well for 2021.Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to slide 10. Starting with CMS, pro forma revenue including KeyW, but excluding the stub period from Wood Nuclear grew 4% year-over-year during the second quarter.During the quarter we saw continued strength in our Cyber, Space including NASA, Mission IT and 5G businesses. Operating profit was $84 million and grew 14% year-over-year and in the single digits on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was down 20 basis points year-over-year to 6.8%, as a result of higher benefit related costs in the quarter. Excluding this impact, underlying adjusted OP margin was up over 20 basis points year ago.In early April, it was exciting to see the initial impacts of the ramp up on the two major new business wins at Navy West Sound and the Air Force research laboratory. However, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, we are expecting a short-term headwind from physical distancing in CMS, mainly in our nuclear remediation business, DOD range operations business, and our commercial business, where a physical presence is necessary.In fact, some of the impact from physical distancing headwinds will result in us recognizing revenue with lower associated or any associated profit. This is due to the U.S. government reimbursing us for our idle employee related costs but not paying us for our fees earned, which represent our profit, as there is a delay in our ability to reach milestones which allow fee benefits to be realized.It is important to note that in a more typical economic slowdown the operating profit from these types of businesses would be highly resilient, as these on-premise and other key programs are well-funded under multi-year contracts.This dynamic will result in a more pronounced impact to operating profit than revenue in our third quarter. On a reported basis we expect CMS operating profit to be down double-digit year-over-year in the third quarter, but with an improved performance in the fourth quarter, which has the potential for year-over-year growth.Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue grew 10% year-over-year and operating profit was up 9%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.3% for the quarter, flat from a year ago and a strong performance given the overhead reimbursable rate issue noted earlier, the strong project mix in the year ago quarter, and headwinds from maintaining talent capacity in the U.K. in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Americas business continued to post strong double-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth. This strength was somewhat offset by softness in the U.K. and timing on major project starts in Advanced Facilities.While we have started strong in the first half of the year, we anticipate reported revenue and operating profit to be down year-over-year in the third quarter, and then begin to see a less negative impact in Q4, as the business recovers to a year-over-year growth outlook in fiscal 2021.Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $37 million for the quarter, up slightly from the Q1 figures and up from $25 million in the year ago period, driven by higher benefit costs.For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect non-allocated corporate costs to approximate $35 million per quarter, absent any allocation reductions to the line of business given our overall efforts to reduce our overhead cost structure in the second half of this year.Now turning to slide 11, I would like to update our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Regarding the sale of ECR, to date we have incurred slightly over $220 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction, separation and restructuring costs. We expect the remaining costs to be incurred over the remainder of the year.The KeyW integration is largely complete and delivering the expected cost reductions, and the team is now focused on leveraging the resources of both companies to drive further revenue synergies.Our acquisition of Wood\u2019s Nuclear business closed on March 6th. Our integration management office is well underway executing against our acquisition playbook. In-line with our playbook, the combined management structure was rolled out on day 1 and the team is executing to deliver the expected $12 million in annual cost synergies. Of course, the overall focus on the strategic logic for the combination and the strategic growth benefits also remains a high priority.Please note that our overall expectations regarding the P&L and cash flow impacts related to separation, restructuring and other transaction related expenses for the full year 2020 remain intact, with approximately $150 million in P&L costs and cash outflow expected over the course of this year. And, as we enter 2021, again its important to note that material differences in GAAP versus adjusted figures will be significantly reduced.Now onto cash flow generation and the balance sheet on slide 12. During the quarter, we generated $113 million in free cash flow. Q2 cash flow was impacted actually by approximately $36 million of restructuring and separation related cash outflows. $85 million has been incurred year-to-date.Including these costs, we continue to expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of fiscal 2020 with total reported free cash flow now expected to be more than $350 million for the full year, which includes a headwind of $150 million from the restructuring items noted above.Assumed in our free cash flow guidance is some expectation that the timing of some customer payments could be impacted over the course of the year given COVID-19.DSO\u2019s were flat from Q1 2020 but up year-over-year. Of note, approximately $50 million of collections were received in late March, but after our quarter end of March 27th. We still see ample opportunities to lower our DSO run-rate which we believe is the major driver for us attaining a one time free cash flow conversion target longer term.And now moving to the balance sheet. As part of our planned capital structure strategy, we executed a 5-year $1 billion unsecured term loan facility during the quarter at an attractive rate of approximately LIBOR, plus a 150 basis points. In addition, we entered into multiple interest rate swaps at different tenors with an aggregate notional value of $900 million to lock in long term effective rates approaching nearly 50% of our total debt.The interest cost approximates an aggregate 2% yield for the fixed portion, and we are pleased that we were able to lock in longer term rates that approximate our short-term rate levels.We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.7 billion and a gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $1.4 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to adjusted 2020 EBITDA is just over one time.As you will note, we chose not to pay down our revolver with the proceeds of the term loan, out of an abundance of caution given the disruption seen in the financial markets in March and April due to the COVID-19 situation. We will continue to monitor and proactively paydown the revolver as markets continue to show increased levels of stability.Regarding capital deployment, we paused our share purchases in March as a precautionary measure as the COVID-19 crisis escalated. Nonetheless, we still repurchased $286 million of shares during the March quarter, and ended the quarter with a remaining $1.1 billion left of authorization.We continue to expect to fully utilize our remaining share buyback authorization over time. However, I reiterate that our immediate use of existing excess cash will be focused on paying down our revolver as market conditions warranted.For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of 132 million for second half of fiscal year 2020, excluding additional share buybacks. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buy-back activity going forward and we\u2019ll provide an update on our quarterly earnings calls related to share count expectations.And regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the second half of fiscal 2020, in line with our longer-term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%.Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was previously increased and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year-ago.Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on slide 13 Steven Demetriou : Thanks, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook to account for the expected impact from COVID-19 on our business over the remainder of fiscal 2020 year.We are updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $950 million to $1.05 billion from our previous range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We are also updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance, to a range of $4.80 to $5.30 from $5.30 to $5.80.At the mid-point of our revised EPS range, 2020 fiscal year adjusted EPS represents year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from fiscal 2020 and 2019 discrete tax items.Our revised guidance is based on an analysis of several scenarios that estimated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results. Specifically, physical distancing initiatives, which create temporary limitations on our clients\u2019 and Jacobs\u2019 ability to perform work primarily in the current fiscal Q3 period is the single biggest impact on these projections.The gross impact to EPS is estimated at approximately $1.50 at the midpoint of our estimates. Included in that estimate is approximately $100 million investment to retain talent, equivalent to approximately $0.50 per share. Importantly, we have strategically decided that we will maintain this talented workforce given our belief that we expect a rebound later this year, thereby ensuring access to this talent as we return to growth.We have taken significant actions to reduce this gross impact by reducing our cost structure, effectively reducing costs in the back half of the year by $1 of EPS. These efforts include elimination of discretionary, corporate, LOB and other employee related costs.As a result, our net expected impact at the midpoint of our range is $0.50 per share based on our decision to maintain our existing work force and to ensure that we have access to our talent to drive the expected return to growth. We believe it is a strategic imperative to retain our talented people across the company.We expect the majority of the earnings revision to occur in our third quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate the impact of the pandemic on Jacobs to subside and our business to return to run-rate levels over the course of the fourth quarter.Importantly, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to improve with potential for year-over-year growth. As previously stated, we expect strong fiscal second half reported free cash flow of at least $400 million. And we believe that 2021 is shaping up for a strong rebound in growth. We\u2019ll provide an update as we approach the end of this fiscal year as we further evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.With that, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the call. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Hey. Good evening, guys. Steve, you've obviously spent a lot of time in the last two years kind of reshaping the portfolio, I'm wondering if you could just provide your thoughts on how impactful what we're going through now is on that going forward. I'm not asking you for kind of guidance on what markets you might invest into. I'm sure that's sensitive for competitive reasonsBut do you see opportunities emerging from this or are those opportunities kind of more on the margins, just trying to get a sense for how material you think you need to adapt the business to what's happening? Steven Demetriou : Sure. Look I think all the work that we did over the last several years strategically is fortuitous, now as we go through this pandemic. When we did that work, we did a lot of strategic analysis on how this will make us a much more resilient company. And even though we're going through a temporary downturn, it's a result of something that you know, none of us ever predicted and that would be that we would be unable to physically go to work, our clients wouldn\u2019t be able to physically go to work, all that is gone through a correction.What we hear and see from our client based on our pipeline that's surging projects and programs that are not getting canceled, they're just moving to the right, that this resilient portfolio will continue to play out and gives us optionality as we move into fiscal 2021. There will be certain sectors amongst our portfolio, a very diverse portfolio that should be clear winners and others that you know, are going to be under pressure.And we're already in that transition of redeploying our workforces, going quickly our workforce to be able to address an attack that - those sectors that you mentioned, that should be big winners as we go into 2021.So you know, we're actually pretty positive about \u201821 and look forward to getting through this his current quarter. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. And then Kevin, just on the trimming of $100 million of EBITDA from this year, how much of that just goes away versus you know, being able to recoup that or is there kind of a lingering effect from some of the headwinds into next year? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, I think - thanks for the question, Joe. We're not going to really talk about 2021. Today although we gave very clear views as it relates to our return to a more normalized level of performance. So I won't go further than that. But I do think that the dynamic of those $100 million, some of that is temporary in nature to ultimately help support our ability to deliver the results in the guidance that we've provided. And then some of that will start to get back at it and reinvesting in certain parts of the business.So I think the fundamental way to think about it is, as we've got this revenue decline in the short term, which then affects ultimately the profitability pretty immediately because we're keeping our talent in place, so that drop in revenue almost falls to the bottom line. We're being very, very diligent and aggressive and - in eliminating kind of almost all discretionary travel and other related costs.And the good news about this though is that we're learning a lot due to some of the things that are happening from working from home and some of the productivity we're seeing, which is good to see, that we're going to take that learning and be able to leverage on that to 2021 and beyond.So not all of it's going to go away, but certainly there is a big chunk that we're just doing it to make sure that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, our employees and our other stakeholders. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. And then in CMS I mean, book-to-bill are very, very good, ranks pretty well amongst your peers on that side of the business. When does that actually start to translate into maybe more material organic growth within CMS? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Well, probably within the next two to four quarters. It's kind of a 6 to 12 month book-and-burn type of cycle and those two - the two big drivers that that drove that book-to-bill ratio, Joe, were long term contracts, I'd give it two to four quarters. Joseph DeNardi : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Michael Dudas : Good afternoon, gentlemen. Steven Demetriou : Hey, Mike. Kevin Berryman : Hi, Michael. Michael Dudas : Steve, very, very - pretty good presentation, very detailed and thoughtful. As you are in the midst of the crisis, do you anticipate as we move through this, will Jacobs as an organization drive more business because your clients are going to pull more opportunities from you or you have the technology and the skill sets to push more solutions on the business where as we look towards \u201920, \u201821 and \u201822 there overall could be maybe a tailwind in a sense because of the changes in the new normal? Steven Demetriou : Yes. Well, again as I started to address that Michael in the first question. I think we're well positioned and what we believe we're going to be all the sort of critical missions and critical activities that are going to go on as we emerge from this COVID-19.And the Life Sciences business is a great example of one, you know, we're an industry leader there. That business has been a very global business and I think is - we believe now is going through a temporary transition to kind of reconfigure the whole supply chain and how to not only you know address the near-term opportunity of therapies and vaccines associated with COVID-19, but really to become more resilient in the event that this type of pandemic or something else happens which has created supply chain issues. And so these are initiatives that you know, we're in the mix on and we're well positioned to capitalize on that, no matter what the outcome is because of our global integrated delivery, our capabilities and our industry-leading position.And so, whether it's life sciences, healthcare, cybersecurity and of course, the critical missions that we do across our CMS business, which have been sort of on temporary hold are going to have to get at it, and we're positioned. You know, you think of the whole CARES Act, that whole CARES act that has supported our businesses to make our talent mission-ready for the essential critical work that's going to have to get done as soon as everyone gets back to work over the next several months. And so you know, there's a tremendous opportunity unfolding for us and we feel like we're well positioned. Michael Dudas : Duly noted. My follow up would be maybe for Bob, you highlighted the social distancing and the mitigation that you and your clients are going through in the field and your opportunities. Is there - do you have a sense of protocol that you're basing this towards in the - later this year. Do you anticipate in 2021 and beyond what we're seeing now and how you're working is how it's going to be? Or is there - these are difficult for a sense of more normalcy that comes back as our society evolves, given that what we've been going through? Robert Pragada : Yes, Mike, I don't think we know the timeline. And so what we're doing in preparation of - instead of preparing for a world post-COVID, we're kind of preparing for a world with Covid and using technology is our friend. And so those physical distancing requirements, let's just take a field application and this applies to both CMNS, as well as PPS, we're developing - actually we have in-house technology around this with our ION platform where we're wearing bracelets that determine how far we are from each other, as well as contact tracing throughout the entirety of different sites or bases.So clearly it's a world that we're not anticipating and we look at our future projections. We're not putting a timeline on. Well, things are going to go back to the way they were on February 1st on X date. We're anticipating that it's going to be going longer. Michael Dudas : Understood. Appreciate your thoughts, gentlemen. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. You guys talked about a number of programs where you expect to ramp back up to targeted profitability levels really by the fourth quarter. It sound like what are all the most important things that have to happen to achieve that. And how much of that do you think is within your control? Steven Demetriou : Yes. Well, I think we said it in our stated remarks that we're attributing 90% of the shortfall to this whole physical distancing limitation. So clearly, a key assumption you know and everything and we're talking about is that, that that's going to start to subside. Governments lift restrictions not only here in the U.S. of different city states, but across the globe.And that all takes place through the course of the remainder of this year. We're not assuming any accelerated basis but, that it gradually happens as - you know, as we're all starting to see. But it's going to happen throughout the third and fourth quarter. So that's you know, that's the major assumption. That's clearly not in our control.And so I think that's kind of a simple answer to your question as far as what's the key driver. Because once that happens I think that's the message we're trying to make sure that you all understand. This is a situation where the demand is sitting there and we just - we and our clients have to physically get back at it.So this is not a situation where projects have been cancelled and we're trying to rebuild the pipeline. We have a record high pipeline. Our backlog has grown. We just got to physically get back to work enough, not the way it used to be, but to a certain level recognizing that we probably as a company will continue to have remote working forever.Now that we've learned that in certain areas it's a more efficient, effective basis. But where we do need the face to face physical interactions and engagement with our clients. That's the key assumption around what we're talking about today. Steven Fisher : Got it. And then your global design center concept has been a very unique element of your margin enhancement opportunities. I am just curious how that usage is ramping up Q2? And then really how you think this new working model will impact the use of the design centers. Is that really an opportunity as everyone learns how to work more remotely is that an even better opportunity to leverage the design centers. Robert Pragada : Yes. Steve, it's Bob. We actually see it as what's happening now, as a catalyst to even drive that strategy at a faster rate. What we've seen specifically in areas like Poland and India and Southeast Asia is - it is an incredible - an incredible level of efficiency as people go to remote and still operating in a design center capacity. And so I think that what's happening now is definitely going to serve as an accelerator for driving connected delivery and integrated delivery to another level.And then as we look forward to kind of the future of the workplace, we are going to have centers that require project collaboration with people in those centers. And so we're looking at layouts and workplace strategies that are unique by the different function of that operation or that office.And so a design center might have a different layout and say its a hub or a client site which might have more - I'm making this up, conference-based rather than workspace cubicles that are socially distance apart from each other.So we're right in the midst of all of that, it's part of that now to next kind of initiative, as we look forward in new markets and new ways of doing things from this dislocation. Steven Fisher : What was the ramp up this quarter on that. Is there a percentage increase in usage or anything you can give? Steven Demetriou : I don't have a exact percentage but I'd say it's been greater than it was in previous quarters. Steven Fisher : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Hi, good evening and hope everyone is - glad to hear everyone's well and healthy. I guess my first question just on the guide, Kevin when you talked about the COVID impact and you talked about you know, the EBITDA and EPS impact, but is there any way you can help us understand the impact across the two different segments CMS and P&PS if possible.And then also just try to understand you know just the cash flow dynamics, I understand why you lowered. However, I'm just trying to understand the impact on cap [ph] what you assume for DSOs by the end of the year where they can go. And then is the CMS cash flow holding better, we're hearing from other contractors that you know government is - d the governor is actually paying their employees quicker. Thanks. Kevin Berryman : Yes. So thanks for the question. Jamie I just. I'll give you some general commentary to give some perspective on the two businesses. The actual kind of dynamics in CMS in Q3 specifically have a greater impact associated with some of the comment that both Steve and Bob just made as it relates to the physical distancing.You think about certainly the nuclear work and some of the other things that we talked about commercial. We actually have to be onsite and certainly the - some of the test range work as well. So that ends up being a bigger impact to CMS. So if you look at versus the size of the business, the majority or the larger piece, I should say in terms of costs or terms as a percentage basis or more CMS based and in 2020 third quarter. But there we\u2019re expecting a challenge in both of the business versus a year ago. So I would say a greater percentage reduction in Q3 for CMS.And then I think ultimately as we transition to Q4, certainly an improving dynamic in CMS and probably a more - a little bit more elongated recovery for PPS just because of the shifting of the portfolios as Bob was characterizing in terms of re-jiggering of pipeline and some of the customers thinking relative to the shaping change of the opportunities.Having said all of that, I will say you know, we're now a few weeks into Q3 and I would say we're encouraged by the views and in the things that we're seeing relative to customers and how they're affecting and our business relative to how we're driving that. So we're being prudent with our view of what the impact is and we're going to see how we play out and ultimately get back at it in 2021.As it relates to cash flow, the second part of that question, I think look, where we took the cash flow guide a little bit down, obviously EBITDA impacted and so certainly part of its there and then the other part is associated with what we're suggesting is a potential as it relates to some disruption on the collection side.We're actually seeing pretty good performance as you suggested on the CMS side. So we're just thinking that it might be more about P&PS. But we'll play that out. And so far we're actually seeing pretty good, pretty good performance through the first parts of Q3. Jamie Cook : And I'm sorry do you want to commit to sort of where we think it can be by year end? Kevin Berryman : No I think we're going to - we're going to hold tight and see how it plays out. But look I think it's embedded into that that new cash flow number, so to be honest they can't fall out of bed, if we're sitting there with the 300 - 350 for the year, free cash flow. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Kevin Berryman : No problem. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Yes. I'm wondering if you could give us some color on the - of bookings as we move through the rest of the calendar year. You still expect kind of a calendar Q3 budget flush at CMS and maybe you could just characterize sort of the front log. What \u2013 how the RFP pipeline coming through and how much and where things might be stretching if at all? Robert Pragada : Yes. So, Gautam, this is Bob. So it is a bit of a different story between CMS and P&PS. And so let me kind of take them both separately. CMS, we see the - talked about it in the script. The pipeline is strong and the pace and velocity of our proposal activity probably hasn't been stronger. And so that has been a pretty strong cadence that it's only been a bit not stifled but slowed when we have those confidential or those secure proposals that we have. We can only do the proposal in a skiff and though we have skiffs within our real estate portfolio at times we have to use our clients as well. So say that strong and we see the award cycles not fundamentally shifting, so that pipeline remains very resilient.On P&PS, again as Steven and Kevin have mentioned before, this isn't a matter of cancellations, it's probably more a matter of some shifting of the pipeline. So we see that bookings target. We're still confident that we can be right on where we had projected, but we're tracking that week for week for potential slippages and most of that is coming from the fact that at our state and local business these are our clients that are probably getting more accustomed to - are becoming a little slower and getting accustomed to working from home then maybe we are.And so we're assisting our clients in the evaluation of these proposals. It's not that they're going away, it's just kind of the piece by which they could be reviewed and awarded.In our private sector business, it's actually been surprisingly resilient. And in fact, we've received some - just recent, can't disclose them, just recent awards from some of our larger private sector clients in the - from beginning to end through evaluation to award, all of those were done remotely. And so it's overall kind of a balanced approach there. We feel confident on this the - on the forecast. Steven Demetriou : Yes, one thing I want to add here on top of what Bob talked about in addition to the size of the pipeline and everything that Bob talked about, as far as the pace is the margin in the pipeline is also improving. And we've got - you know, we've really upgraded our capability to measure and monitor this over the last 12 to 18 months.And as we look at that pipeline that Bob talked about compared to a year ago, the margin is a significant improvement, so which bodes well for our strategic goal of not only profitably growing, but increasing the margin of Jacob's. Gautam Khanna : Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Thanks guys for taking my questions. I appreciate all the color. To be clear, I know EBITDA is expected to grow in 2021. Is there some expectations that we could see the weakness in the second half of this year lead into the first half - in the first half of next year in that PPS segment? Because it seems there's a lot of confidence that CMS kind of inflects in the fourth quarter. But could PSS with the delays and maybe pressure on public budgets and the small local and state municipalities, is there an issue that can bleed, can some of these delays bleed into the first half of next year? Steven Demetriou : Well, let me start and then Bob maybe build on it. You started getting into an area that we're all watching closely is how, what's going to happen now on a state and local level because you know the government in the US has done a great job to really support the defense and civil you know, the federal side. And now what know we're looking anxiously, looking forward to seeing what they do with the next round of cares, hopefully in the next few weeks around state and local.And you know, there's a lot of positive news coming out that you know, I think everyone expects that they're going to provide relief to that sector. And so that should start to provide some good foundation as we enter 2021.And then the other piece is that, you know, there's a lot of discussion about, finally because this has been going on for years even pre-COVID is, the need for a big federal infrastructure stimulator to really get people going, putting the work, back to work around addressing the crisis across the nation on highways, bridges, a whole host of areas, you know, the need to continue to accelerate water and wastewater - and the whole broadband and everything else.So we're hoping and monitoring that and lobbying and very active on the hill to hopefully see later this year Congress could finally get at that that big infrastructure stimulus, whether that happens later this year or leaks into early next year, that's a real positive for Jacobs.And so you know, I think that's going to play a piece of what kind of momentum. If nothing happens and you know, there's a big vacuum on supporting the state local side. Yes, that could provide some headwinds over the next six plus months. But Bob\u2026 Robert Pragada : Yes. So it would maybe I'll also a bit talk about where we're positioned and we saw this you know in previous cycles as well. And I think it's actually even strengthened during this dislocation is the depth of intimacy we have with our clients. There was a previous question about what we can control and what we can't control.What we can't control is our ability to solve our client's deepest challenges and right now our clients are experiencing challenges that they've never even seen before. And with our, whether it be a framework agreement that we've had for decades and that\u2019s CMS and P&PS alike or you know newer clients that we're now getting into different types of solutions over providing.We're getting to a point where whenever it comes back and it might be a step change in one part of our business and more of a trend in the other part of our business. I would say that we are better positioned now to capitalize on that than we ever have been ever. And we have been in a good position in the past as well. So we're positive about that. Michael Feniger : Thank you. That was helpful. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Australia and how you saw aviation and lower tax revenue due to the lower commodities and you think it's going to hit Q3 and then should recover in Q4. Can you just flesh out why that, that is the case. I understand the limitation, fiscal limitations and the shortfall from COVID being able to get to certain sites and the impact that's having there. But why for example, that example you provided with Australia, why does that just be isolated into Q3 and then we had that recovery in the Q4? Robert Pragada : Yes, because I think that there were tailwinds going into COVID, that COVID magnified. And so you know the commodity crisis though was exacerbated and effectively magnified as a result of everything that we've read about in the news, whether it be oil or gas or even in the metals commodities, COVID accelerated it to where now the need for government intervention was further accentuated.And so, I think the speed by which we're seeing government intervention in, whether it be in Singapore and Australia or New Zealand, it's faster and it's already happening. Michael Feniger : Perfect. And just lastly, I mean, on the free cash flow is there anything we should be aware of when we turn to page 20, 21\u2026 Robert Pragada : Hello? Next question. Operator : Thank you. Steven Demetriou : Jump back in the queue. Robert Pragada : You need to get in there. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate all the color today. My question is just you know, as we look at the margin being up in the bid pipeline, I'm just curious if there's sensitivity to that assessment around the macro environment? To what extent is the bid pipeline price sensitive? And you know is there kind of a risk that you know, the assessment of that margin profile on the work you're looking at could degrade? Steven Demetriou : Well, you know, I think the margin improvement is less about pricing and more about mix and the type of programs and projects we\u2019re strategically going after. So look, I think everything always has you know, a potential to be under pressure, under certain situations when you talk about margin.But I think we're confident in the margin profile improvement because it's been a strategic emphasis on driving a different approach on the type of things that we're going after and prioritizing you know, rather than as we started this transformation journey several years ago it was like let's just sort of go after everything that we can and it's much more of a strategic approach now, as we've you advanced the company, culture around strategy. So we would say that it's a pretty solid profile, less around macroeconomics and more about delivering on winning those new types of businesses. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark Company. Josh Sullivan : Good evening. Just on the intelligent - on the intelligent asset management vertical. You had the recent win at the Kitsap base in Washington. Can you give us any color, any early read on that contract? And I'm curious if, you know, your other intelligent asset contracts at Mayport or Langley, are you seeing interest to expand their scope to address the virus? Steven Demetriou : So the short answer Josh, is yes, we are seeing interest to expand our scope, talk specifically on the first part of your question with regards to the West sound contract in Washington with NASA. That's a really unique case. One, the team did a fantastic job on winning that with a differentiated solution and then keep in mind, we were awarded and had to mobilize in the midst of COVID. And we interviewed selected and mobilized folks all virtually and it was a true testament to our team and in CMS, led by Steve Arnett.. He did bit a - the team did a fantastic job at that.I think others are catching part especially when you talk about Mayport and specifically other NASA-type facilities. And so I think that differentiator of, yes, we can provide more value from the actual asset Intelligent Asset Management offering, but we don't need this prolonged, very in-depth and laborious mobilization plan in the means and methods and how we do it is going to lead to even greater growth. Josh Sullivan : Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow up you know, as far as the bid pipeline, any would say or quantify what percentage is in intelligence assets? Steven Demetriou : I might have to get back to you on that one. It's - you know, it's kind of weaved into a lot of our offering, but as far as giving you an exact number as a percent of the pipeline, I probably needed to follow up on that. Josh Sullivan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Andrew Wittman with Baird. Andrew Wittman : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm going to just do a couple of cleanup questions because I think all the big picture and other questions have been taking care of here. But I wanted to understand here if in the quarter there were any award fees, project closeouts or the like that were reported in the results that we should know about impacting the quarter. Obviously these come up from time to time and didn't have a comment, so I thought I'd ask. Steven Demetriou : We always we always have that Andrew, but ultimately not mature at all in the quarter. Andrew Wittman : Okay. And then just as it relates to some of the more newly acquired companies here obviously Wood groups closed in the quarter, I was wondering what the contribution from that was to the backlog, as well as the maybe the total amount of revenues from that and KeyW that were recognized in the quarter? Steven Demetriou : Yes. The new backlog from Wood was just over $400, about $4.25 million. And then what was the second part of the question. Andrew Wittman : The acquired revenues from KeyW and Wood in the quarter. Steven Demetriou : From KeyW I don't have that handy, but the stop period for Wood was very, very small, probably about $20 million or so. Andrew Wittman : Thanks. Operator : There is no additional callers in the queue, sir. Are there any closing comments or remarks. Jonathan Doros : Yes, we're going to be closing comments. Steven Demetriou : All right. So thanks everyone. Our transformation over the last 4 years as we just discussed during Q&A is been focused on building a strong culture and a portfolio which would prove resilient under multiple economic scenarios. Clearly COVID-19 is presenting a challenge that no one could not have predicted. But our transformation is proving to be the foundation that\u2019s going to help us see - us through this all \u2013 through this successfully. We are keeping our people safe, delivering on our commitments to our clients. We are also moving with swiftness and agility, shifting our work model to ensure business continuity and we\u2019re in the process of accelerating our digital transformation plan. And most importantly, we are retaining our most important asset, our talent to people. And so as we define how we\u2019re going to work in the future, we expect to benefit from significant cost savings, as well as further positive cultural benefits and the flexibility for our people and advancements in how we serve our clients. And that future starts now. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that now concludes the call. You may disconnect.",

With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : All right. Thank you, Jon. And thanks everyone for joining us today to discuss our third quarter business performance and strategy update. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to occupy our time, as leaders, we must not lose sight on speaking up for what's right. Earlier today, we launched Jacobs\u2019 Global Action Plan for advancing justice and equality, which was developed in a direct response to recent social and racial injustices. For the last several years, I've been pleased with Jacobs\u2019 industry-leading progress on building a high-performance culture, led by our focus on inclusion and diversity, which we call TogetherBeyond. We believe this has been a critical success factor in driving improved performance and shareholder returns. Today's launch of Jacobs\u2019 Advancing Justice and Equality Action Plan is our next phase of this journey and holds on are TogetherBeyond strategy with the four primary pillars centered around culture building and engagement; leadership, commitment and accountability; developing talent; and growing the business. This action plan is about achieving true equality for all our employees, current and future, with a priority now on ensuring black employees have unquestionable equal opportunity and the tools needed to advance and achieve their ultimate goals at Jacobs. I'm proud of the employee engagement in the development of this action plan, starting with the team, who collaborated alongside Jacobs' Board of Directors and our executive leadership team to outline transparent, specific and measurable actions. First commitment is amplifying a culture of belonging by expanding our existing Conscious Inclusion program through Bystander Intervention training with the commitment to training our 55,000-person global workforce by the end of fiscal year 2021. Engaging 3,000 Jacobs\u2019 leaders and meaningful dialogues on antiracism to expand their focus on justice and equality. Driving personal accountability of senior leadership for inclusion by tying individual inclusion and diversity performance plan to compensation. And adding Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a U.S. holiday, encouraging employees to engage in volunteer opportunities around equality of justice. Our second commitment is to recruit, retain and advance black employees based on merit by increasing the representation of black employees at all levels over the next three years to proportionally reflect the overall external population. To accomplish this, we are increasing our leadership development programs to accelerate advancement for black employees to all levels of leadership, requiring all senior leaders to sponsor and mentor at least one black employee and ensure global reach to these efforts, and further strengthening the diversity Jacobs\u2019 Board of Directors including black representation. This has been a success area for our Board over the last four years, but one that can be continually improved as Board members retire and as we appoint highly talented diverse contributors. Our third commitment is about driving structural change in the broader society. To meet this commitment, we'll donate $10 million over the next five years in support of black educational and professional development opportunities that include two specific areas. Supporting primary and secondary education programs, focused on science, technology, engineering, arts and math, to prepare black students for esteemed professions. And providing financial support for scholarship, mentoring and internship opportunities at Jacobs for black high school and college students. In addition to that investment, we're also promoting programs with organizations committed to justice and equality through collectively, Jacobs\u2019 giving and volunteering platform including leveraging our expertise in areas like water for at-risk urban and rural communities. And materially increasing the percentage of Jacobs spend over the next five years with women and minority owned suppliers and vendors. To drive this action plan and our global IND strategy, we have appointed Jeff Dingle as Vice President of TogetherBeyond. Advancing justice and equality requires strong leadership and a relentless drive to deliver on the vision. And Jeff is the right person to lead this important work and grow a culture where employees want to join, stay and thrive. Ultimately, we must create a culture in which every person can access a future of opportunities, contributing to a structural change that Jacobs and in the broader society is about doing our part as a global leader. The time is now for us to get this right, once and for all. Turning to slide 5 to discuss our continued focus on keeping our people safe during the pandemic and how we're supporting clients to solve COVID-19 challenges. As we approach five months of battling the coronavirus, we remain focused on keeping our people safe first and foremost, and delivering on our commitments to our clients. As the duration of the pandemic has extended, Jacobs\u2019 strong culture of caring and particularly our emphasis on employee wellbeing has really come to the forefront. Our teams have responded with new programs for engaging our people in supportive ways, including deep dive series on mental health resiliency. Situation continues to be fluid, and as a global company, the variability from location to location is dramatic. Our crisis management teams continue to monitor and respond to the pandemic in our local areas. And with regard to our efforts around a return to the workplace, we are demonstrating flexibility to fit the needs of our people and our clients, while accelerating our future of work strategy. Our efforts in supporting our clients and communities in fighting COVID-19 include on the treatment side, our world leading pharmaceutical solutions team playing a major role in the retrofit of facilities to rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Our teams are also supporting clients of public health response strategies in U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand. And from a solution standpoint, we're deploying our proprietary ION technology for contact tracing with pharmaceutical clients at large scale facilities. We're developing scenario modeling software being used by transit clients around the globe, and digital monitoring of waste streams for COVID-19 at municipal water treatment plants. Turning to slide 6. Our business, which at its core, solves highly technical scientific-based challenges across a variety of sectors, proved its resiliency in one of the most abrupt global disruptive shocks that we have experienced. Part of our resiliency is driven by an alignment to high-value sectors of the global economy, such as national security, water infrastructure, environmental resiliency, healthcare and life sciences, intelligent asset management, space exploration and the convergence of information and operational technology. In addition to deep technical expertise, we benefit from economies of scale in both our businesses. This provides us the ability to quickly adjust to global changes in demand and manage our cost structure. More importantly, our culture fosters strong business acumen and innovative thinking to adapt rapidly to shifts in demand. While we were certainly impacted by the pandemic during our third quarter, from a financial standpoint, we showed solid performance during the quarter with pro forma backlog up 4%. Adjusted operating profit was up 3% year-over-year as we quickly transitioned to the new virtual work environment with strong productivity, while carefully managing discretionary spending. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $332 million and now expect reported fiscal 2020 free cash flow to approach $400 million. Overall, we witnessed better than expected performance in the third quarter, given the ability to proactively work with our clients to overcome physical distancing requirements. Considering this third quarter performance and our initial view of our fourth quarter, we're raising our fiscal 2020 outlook. COVID-19 will continue to impact us in the fourth quarter, and likely provide challenges into early fiscal 2021. For the full fiscal 2021, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth with potential infrastructure stimulus providing upside relative to these expectations. Finally, we continue to maintain healthy financial flexibility with ample liquidity that can be prudently deployed toward high-return opportunities. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the third quarter, our CMS business performed better than the COVID outlook we provided in the second quarter. Our solid third quarter results demonstrate CMS\u2019s resiliency and agility to work and perform at the highest levels for our clients. Though we will continue to be in COVID impacted environment through early fiscal 2021, our performance has been encouraging. The ability to recover from the shutdown despite physical distancing occurred faster than originally anticipated as our workforce and clients have addressed challenges and continue to execute on our contracts, regardless of work location. The underlying structural demand for our services remained strong. And as a result, total CMS backlog is now at $9.1 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. While a portion of our CMS portfolio can be performed remotely, we did see some impact in our long-term enterprise contracts that involve highly technical work on client sites. Some elements of these stable and resilient contracts did experience temporary impacts from physical distancing protocols. Let me share with you some details on the impact along with some notable wins by sector. Our U.S. federal civilian business makes up about 35% of CMS\u2019s revenue, with the majority of the revenue coming from our NASA and DOE clients. As we\u2019ve shared with you in the past, Jacobs provides broad support to NASA in its accelerated work to meet the current administration's mandate to return to the moon in 2024. NASA must make progress towards these national goals, despite the challenges of working remotely and the reduced on-site workforce. At the end of our second quarter, we anticipated a low overall impact at NASA in the second half of fiscal year \u201820. Through the third quarter, that has been the actual case, as most of our workers have transitioned well to working remotely or operating within on-site physical distancing guidelines. Our NASA portfolio is expected to return to full capacity as we approach the end of our fiscal year. As NASA's largest provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of NASA's Artemis program -- excuse me, largest services provider of many aspects of NASA's Artemis program to extend the frontiers of human deep space exploration, sending humans to the moon by 2024, then to Mars and beyond. I would like to highlight a couple of achievements. A major milestone was reached in June when the solid rocket boosters arrived at the Kennedy Space Center to power NASA's Space Launch System. The Jacobs team handles final checkout and integration of all flight hardware for Artemis mission and is currently working on the integration of this hardware. Jacobs NASA team was also recently featured in wired magazine for utilizing artificial intelligence and generative design algorithms to build components for NASA's next generation spacesuit, the first major update in decades. Moving on to our nuclear portfolio. Last quarter, we'd anticipated this business would be moderately impacted by physical distancing constraints, resulting in a decrease in on-site workforce. Despite these headwinds, through the achievement of a few key performance milestones, several contract extension and overall business efficiencies, the nuclear portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter. Now, moving on to the U.S. Intelligence Community, which contributes just over 20% of CMS\u2019s revenue. Our Mission IT, C5ISR and Cyber businesses provide solutions to the sector. Last quarter, we had anticipated a moderate impact in Q3 from physical distancing headwinds at secured sites that would require split shifts. Based on actual results in Q3, we are now back at approximately 80% of normal operating levels and we expect all sites to be back to approximately 90% by the end of the fiscal year. In line with our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, it is important to note that we are transitioning off a lower margin classified procurement contract, which will impact short-term revenue growth during our fourth quarter, but has little impact to operating profit. As a result, our unit margins will benefit. Kevin will provide further details in his remarks. Our Mission IT business was awarded two notable contracts during the quarter for both -- both for the Department of Justice. The first is a three-year contract to modernize mission critical applications; and the second will provide software and network dev op support for the clients next generation laboratory information system. Additionally, in our space ISR business, we progressed to the next phase of a highly classified space solution, further solidifying Jacobs\u2019 position as a disruptor in this high-growth, high-margin sector. Shifting to the U.S. Department of Defense sector, which makes up approximately 20% of CMS\u2019s revenue, we provide a wide range of mission critical services performed at government sites or in highly secure facilities. At the end of Q2, we had anticipated much of our work at the military test ranges and classified skiffs to be moderately impacted by physical distancing requirements, actual performance matched our expectations. However, these impacts were partially mitigated by our work at the missile defense agency and positive performance in our cyber portfolio. Overall, these sites are now executing at approximately 80% of normal operating levels, and we expect our DOD work to ramp up to approximately 95% as we approach the end of the calendar year. Jacobs\u2019 continues to win new large enterprise contracts and raise its profile across the Department of Defense. For the Air Force, Jacobs was awarded a $434 million six-year contract with the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, providing system support and integration. Additionally, for the Navy Kings Bay facility, we were awarded a contract to deliver our intelligent asset management solution. Neither award is included in our Q3 backlog, but we recently received news that NORAD cleared the pro test [ph] period and will be included in our Q4 backlog. We remain encouraged that our Kings Bay will also successfully clear pro test. Shifting now to our commercial business. This business makes up just under 10% of our CMS\u2019s revenue. In telecom, we provide solutions for the buildout of 5G networks, a business that was impacted more severely than anticipated in Q3, from access limitations at some sites. We expect this business to strengthen over the next couple of quarters and return to its strong long-term demand rates thereafter. For the automotive sector, we primarily design and operate aerodynamic wind tunnels and provide general technical services, engineering and testing of automotive engines. Anticipated delayed awards Q3 did occur as our auto clients reevaluate their CapEx portfolios and future demand requirements. We expect a slower return to normal levels later in fiscal year \u201821. Finally, our CMS international sector makes up 15% of CMS\u2019 revenue and includes nuclear lifecycle solutions, support for UK\u2019s Ministry of Defense on its continuous At Sea Deterrent program and air and land weapons program in the UK and Australia. Our actual Q3 impact was less than anticipated. Strong shift work execution and physical distancing practices resulted in better performance. We expect our international business to return to approximately 95% of its normalized run rate as we exit the fiscal year. In summary, our overall sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline of $30 billion with $9 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile. We continue to see strong structural demand for our CMS services, even as impacts resulting from COVID-19 continue. Given we are aligned to high-priority mission-critical areas of federal governments, we do not anticipate material impact to our outlook in the event there's a change in administration. Moving to our People & Places Solutions business on slide 8. Our P&PS business generated a strong quarter and backlog performance, up 4.3% over the same period last year and up 3.2% quarter-over-quarter with an increased gross profit and backlog across all geographies and sectors. Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.2 times. While our pipeline remains robust across all geographies, we remain sensitive to the timing of economic recovery and government stimulus funding. Our business is well-positioned to benefit from current stimulus funding bills under review in multiple geographies around the world. Last quarter, I spoke about the anticipated COVID-19 impact to our People & Places Solutions business from a geographic and industry sector standpoint, as well as how we have optimized our delivery admits the pandemic. I'm pleased to say that overall, we are performing better than the moderate impact scenario we expected with most of our existing projects continuing and minimal to moderate delays in new awards. The diversity and resilience of our business and the ability to draw upon market, global and digital conductivity to deliver lasting and relevant solutions to our customers has been the key differentiator for us. Beginning with our buildings and infrastructure geographies, the Americas, including federal and environmental services business continues to be one of our best-performing and most resilient geographies with minimal impacts from COVID-19 to-date. Our federal infrastructure and water sectors continue to outperform, and we are retaining some of the best talent in the industry, resulting in strong revenue growth year-over-year. Demonstrating the depth and breadth of our solutions offering we were awarded several major projects in the portfolio, spanning multiple end market. For example, we've been selected for the design of $130 million drinking water pipeline for the Great Lakes Water Authority in Detroit. In Texas, we were selected for the Interstate Highway 35 Mobility program which will improve conductivity for all forms of transit across 80 miles of I-35. And we were awarded a major follow-on contract with FEMA for continued hurricane recovery efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We anticipate continued steady performance. However, delays and stimulus funding could affect the timing of new awards in FY21. In our Europe and Middle East business, recent UK government funding authorizations for environmental and water programs, including a recent award with Anglian Water Services show promise amidst continued Brexit-related slowdowns. The Anglian Water strategic pipelines alliance will deliver a new connected infrastructure, leveraging technology such as digital twins to drive greater efficiency and reliability. In our Middle East business, we're observing prioritized investments in water and transportation infrastructure. We remain cautiously optimistic on expectations for recovery in both of these geographies later in fiscal year 2021. Our Asia Pacific business performed better than anticipated. In Australia, New Zealand, we experienced material growth in the quarter and are up year-on-year on both revenue and operating profit. We converted our pipeline into several major wins in cloud computing and healthcare and are leveraging our global delivery capabilities. Southeast Asia remains steady with some project-related delays due to the pandemic and we anticipate some volatility into fiscal year '21. Building on our higher value solution capability, we have been selected as program manager for the new Noida International Airport in Delhi, India. We will provide strategic planning, risk management, digital solutions and program management for this new Greenfield development. We're applying our global integrated delivery model to provide leading solutions from around the world to this exciting project. Last quarter, we indicated that our advanced facilities business worldwide would likely experience positive effects from responding to the global pandemic. The demand for therapeutics and vaccine facilities is increasing. And we have drawn upon our global leadership to lock in several key wins in the quarter with several more in the pipeline. These projects tend to be shorter duration, high intensity projects, allowing us to leverage innovative and integrated delivery technique to meet demand. As an example, we're working with AstraZeneca to retrofit an existing fill finish manufacturing facility to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the market, as soon as late calendar year 2020, subject to clinical test results. We're also seeing an uptick in demand for data centers and semiconductor manufacturing due to increased cloud computing requirements. We have continued optimism for these businesses. I will now discuss our core sectors. Global mobility restrictions are easing in several regions and we are seeing a slow recovery in all modes of transportation. Early government relief funding has sustained many critical infrastructure projects and we're seeing continued investment in rail, including a recent award with transport from New South Wales to transform the rail network for communities across the Greater Sydney area. Additional global government stimulus is expected to include transportation related funding aimed at driving economic recovery. Although timing, trajectory and other key details remain uncertain. While our current business remains stable, continuing resolution and stimulus funding will drive growth opportunities. The water market continues to be resilient with long-term demand in both, upgrades to water infrastructure and utility operations and maintenance. Additionally, we continue to see ongoing growth in digital solutions including smart metering, AI, data analytics, automation and remote operations. While market indicators suggest CapEx pressure in 2021 and recovery into 2022, as the pandemic abates and stimulus funding becomes available, we still expect to maintain growth momentum driven by solid performance with our clients and superior expertise that effectively leverages tech-enabled solutions. The environmental sector is expected to see flat to moderate growth in 2021, with demand continuing steadily from federal and private clients, as well as stimulus related to investment in green and blue infrastructure. In addition to DoD client focus on PFAS, some states have established grant programs to address PFAS remediation. Further, we believe a focus on climate change initiatives will drive opportunities globally. We are well-positioned for continued growth and to capitalize on these new opportunities through trusted relationships with long-term clients, our diversity of markets in which we can apply innovative environmental solutions and strong retention of our global pool of expertise. In the built environment, which includes government facilities, healthcare, higher education and smart cities. We are seeing demand for repurposing business space as the need for a distributed work environment, and smart and sustainable buildings continues, allowing us to leverage our digital solutions. Our global healthcare crisis response team is combining multidisciplinary expertise from across the world to provide dynamic, forward-thinking, advisory and resilient solutions to a broad range of clients responding to the pandemic, as well as to those healthcare clients adapting to new healthcare service delivery models. Summing up the quarter. The negative effects of the global pandemic on growth in our People & Places Solutions business were partially offset by solid engagements with our core clients, and ongoing cost control. We continue to be proactive and agile to shifting market trends, which has resulted in a solid type of pipeline, and allows us to continue to drive our global, market and digital connectivity strategy. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. I'll discuss a more detailed summary now of our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on slide nine. Third quarter gross revenue increased 3% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue down 4%. PPS net revenue was flat year-over-year and CMS declined 9% on a pro forma basis. As Bob noted in his comments, the CMS decline was mainly attributed to physical distancing restrictions experienced to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.5%, down 35 basis points year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, the gross margin continues to face a headwind due to the flow-through effect on the reimbursable rate of our more efficient cost structure in PPS -- P&PS, positively offset by gross margin improvements in our CMS business. The lower reimbursement rate for fixed costs is more than offset by the underlying lower level of G&A costs, thus representing positive operating profit and margin impacts. This is reflected in lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 40 basis points year-over-year to 14.6%. During the current quarter, our G&A also benefited from lower travel and employee-related costs associated with actions taken to offset the short-term financial headwinds from COVID-19. Now that we have increased visibility into the dynamics of operating in the COVID-19 environment, we are adjusting our operating model accordingly and expect G&A as a percentage of revenue to increase modestly in the fourth quarter. GAAP operating profits improved substantially versus last year, driven by lower integration and divestiture-related costs, up 116% to $194 million and included $20 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, and $24 million of other charges consisting of $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, and $1 million of costs associated with Worley transition services agreement. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $239 million, up 3% from the prior year figure. Our adjusted operating profits in net revenue was 8.9%, up 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, driven by higher CMS and PPS margins, effectively offset by higher unallocated corporate expense. I'll discuss the underlying drivers of these costs on the next slide. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $227 million and $1.73 per share, and included a $0.71 net benefit, largely driven by the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake, and $0.11 per share of after-tax restructuring, transaction and other charges as noted above, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was a $1.26 including a $0.05 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding discrete tax items in both the current and year-ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was essentially flat year-over-year. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $254 million or 9.5% of net revenue was down 2% year-over-year compared to the 3% increase in adjusted operating process, which was primarily due to a headwind from other income due to FX and non-controlling interest. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 for Q3, driven by the strong P&PS book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 times. CMS was -- book-to-bill was just under 1 times and reflected the burn off from Hanford Plateau. Importantly, the CMS Q3 backlog does not include our new awards at Navy Kings Bay and NORAD. The pipeline dynamics within CMS remain stable with no unusual delays or project cancellations. Within P&PS, the overall sales pipeline supports our top-line growth objectives, but we are seeing changes in the underlying composition of opportunities and timing on larger awards, which is reflected in our financial outlook. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to slide 10. Starting with CMS, pro forma revenue declined 8.6% year-over-year during the third quarter. CMS operating profits was $90 million and was up 17% year-over-year, but flat on a pro forma basis and well above our original expectation due to the COVID-19 dynamic. CMS operating profit margin was up 80 basis points year-over-year to 7.4%, overcoming the impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The upside versus our previous expectations were driven by a faster-than-expected transition to a virtual work environment and a return to COVID compliant onsite work environments. In line with our expectation, we also saw meaningful year-over-year decrease in lower margin procurement revenue, causing a top line headwind and an immaterial impact on OP dollar growth, given the lower margin associated with procurement related activities, resulting in a positive impact on OP margins. Also contributing to our OP growth was a milestone-based incentive fee that was achieved during the quarter. Please note, we are still experiencing material physical distancing limitation within our nuclear remediation efforts and for some secured work environments, as onsite access continues to be less than optimal, but we expect these operations to gradually improve utilization early into fiscal 2021. Also, in line with our CMS strategy of moving up the value stack, we expect margins to continue to improve over time as we pursue higher value opportunities. As we transition our CMS portfolio away from lower value services, such as procurement, we expect some short-term headwinds to revenue growth and a positive margin impact. Long-term, we continue to expect performance in line with our strategic long-term targets. Moving to people and places. Q3 net revenue was slightly down year-over-year. Let me provide more insight into the impacts associated with COVID-19. We and our clients swiftly moved to virtual work environments and our clients kept current projects continuing at historical burn rates. We saw continued strong underlying performance in the Americas even in the face of COVID. Net revenue increased double digits. Our advanced facilities customers initially slowed the pace of some projects as they digested the macro environment. However, they quickly shifted their CapEx plans to support potential COVID vaccines and therapies in addition to their current product mix. We continue to see headwinds in our UK business even after removing the physical distancing impact from COVID. That region's net revenue declined double-digits. While we are optimistic that the UK will begin to recover later in fiscal 2021, we remain cautious on the timing of that improvement. Operating profit was up 4%. As a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 13% for the quarter, up over 50 basis points, both year-over-year and from Q2. Our P&PS margin was supported by adjusting our cost structure, by reducing discretionary spending, including travel and also benefited from lower employee related costs. Our non-allocated corporate overhead costs were $41 million for quarter, up slightly from the Q2 figures and up from $27 million in the year ago period. A few discrete items contributed to the slightly higher costs, including some higher than normal legal and IT costs. We continue to target $35 million as the run rate outlook for unallocated corporate costs. Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a total reported net revenue to be up slightly year-over-year, which result in adjusted EBITDA up sequentially. This includes resuming some discretionary spend to position us for year-over-year growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Now, turning to Slide 11, I would like to update you on our initiatives relative to our recent M&A and divestiture actions. Regarding the sale of ECR, to-date, we have now incurred slightly over $250 million of the approximate $230 million in related transaction separation and restructuring costs. We expect the remaining costs to be incurred over the remainder of the year. Turning to our acquisition of Woods Nuclear business, as a reminder, the transaction closed on March 6th. Integration continues to progress and we are on track to achieve our targeted $12 million run rate cost savings. Finally, we expect approximately $35 million of total charges in Q4 fiscal 2020 related to the ECR separation, wood cost to achieve synergies and other nonrecurring impacts, which is in line with the approximate $150 million in P&L costs that we have projected and expected over the course of this year. Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the quarter, we generated $332 million in free cash flow. Q3 cash flow was impacted by a net positive $25 million due to benefits from cash taxes, partly offset by headwinds from cash outflow associated with restructuring and other items. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect approximately $130 million of net nonrecurring outflows. Including these impacts, we continue to expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of fiscal 2020 with total reported free cash flow to now approach $400 million for the full year. As anticipated, DSOs were up from Q2 2020 and up year-over-year, as we expected some disruption from COVID-19. We still see ample opportunities to lower our DSO run rate, which will be a major driver for us attaining a one times free cash flow conversion target longer term. And now moving to the balance sheet. As the financial market stabilized over our fiscal third quarter, we repaid approximately $950 million on our revolving credit facility. We still ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.2 billion, resulting in $1.1 billion of net debt before attributing any benefits of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted EBIT 2020 EDA is just under 1 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regarding capital deployment, as we outlined last quarter, we paused our share purchases as a precautionary measure as the COVID-19 crisis escalated. Our business proved out its expected resiliency and cash generation capabilities. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share buyback activity going forward. For modeling purposes, we would expect an average share count of $132 million for the fourth quarter 2020 and fiscal year 2021, excluding additional share buybacks. Regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 in line with our longer term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased earlier this year and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus year ago. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on Slide 13. Steve Demetriou : All right. Thanks, Kevin. Now, let me review our total company outlook. Given our better than expected transition to a virtual work environment and the ramp up of on site operations, we\u2019re updating our fiscal 2020 outlook. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $1 billion to $1.50 billion from the $950 million to $1.50 billion. We are also updating our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.05 to $5.30, up from the $4.80 to $5.30 previous guidance. Importantly, at the midpoint of our revised EPS range, 2020 total fiscal year adjusted EPS represents year-over-year growth when excluding the impact from discrete tax items in both years. Let me also provide some insight to the COVID specific impact on this outlook. At the time of our second quarter earnings call, we communicated that we expected the gross impact to second half 2020 earnings would be approximate -- the net impact the second half fiscal 2020 earnings would be approximately $0.50 per share. However, as a result of our enhanced ability to adapt to physical distancing, we now expect a lower net impact from COVID of $0.35 per share. Given our success in adjusting our operations to a virtual work environment, we are further evaluating opportunities to significantly improve our efficiency through new structural changes to our future of work and look forward to sharing our strategy over the coming quarters. And looking into fiscal 2021, we continue to expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth with the second half stronger than the first half performance. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, we'll now open the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : First question maybe for Bob. When you talked about in your prepared remarks looking at your P&PS business, and maybe a little bit more detail on the public funded versus private funded areas. Obviously, you mentioned some positive takeaways from some of the private sector advanced facilities work. How concerned are you relative to what we're seeing from Washington and the time lag relative to on the public side getting some of those projects that are on the books start to get some revenues flowing to the bottom line? Is that part of the caution that you're looking at the fiscal year, or say first calendar quarter of fiscal \u201821 moving into \u201821 going forward? Bob Pragada : Michael, we\u2019re actually cautiously optimistic that something will be done. But in any scenario, the strength of our backlog right now is sustainable and resilient. So really when we talk about growth is really is the discussion around the dependence on stimulus. As far as a steady she goes, our backlog is represented back to date. So that kind of brings a little bit of the separation as being totally and solely dependent on those that are being discussed right now, become more of a topic later in the fiscal year, next year. Michael Dudas : And when you talk about from the private sector on the advanced facilities on the vaccines and such and data centers and the technology side, but you say its high intensity, that could be a positive surprise impact to \u201821 revenue, \u201821, \u201822 revenue or booking flows and is that something that's much more real behind the scenes and maybe what we\u2019re seeing from the news going on in the marketplace that there\u2019s certainly quite a bit of that in those sectors? Bob Pragada : And Michael, you've been with us for a long time, you know how well positioned we are there too. So, we see the short term book and burn component of that being a real positive for us. And we're seeing, I would call, we're in the early innings of what that could mean for the business, specifically our positioning with these clients that we've had for several decades. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : It could be Bob or Steve, I think every defence company's being asked now how sensitive their business is due to defence budgets over the next few year. So I want to ask you that but maybe in a slightly different way. I think a significant aspect of the CMS strategy or at least a big part of the pipeline at CMS relates to weapons and program sustainment and that the opportunity there is mainly taking market share from OEMs, you won NORAD, it shows you guys have the capabilities to win sustainment. So can you talk about your confidence and being able to grow CMS over the next few years regardless of the top line DoD budget number? Thank you. Steve Demetriou : Bob, let me start and you add on. Actually, when we look at the budget that's relatively flat overall on Department of Defence, the certain -- components of that budget, when you start to peel your onion, is actually there's several growth items that are aligned with most of our priority initiatives. You look at the DoD space budget its up 28%, $18 billion budget, which fits right into our whole space intelligence activities coming out of the whole KeyW acquisition. Cybersecurity is up 5%. The Hypersonics, which were a growing player with our missile defence work, a recent Air Force win, some work that we do for NASA around that area, a whole host of classified programs where the budgets are up. And then you even look at, you know, like PFAS where they added $180 million where we're in the mix there. So environmental, Department of Defense, across our CMS, we actually feel pretty positive from a budget standpoint, even when you look at the headline of a flat Department of Defense budget. Bob Pragada : Joe, the other part of that question is around and the strategy around gaining that market share really then comes from technology hubs that we have within the overall company and differentiating our position around what would traditionally been a people and seats kind of business around sustainment. So a technology enabled solution in order to take that market share. Joseph DeNardi : Kevin, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that transitioning to higher margin work at CMS will represent revenue headwind near term. What's the message there? I mean, how material is that? When does the headwind kind of end? And is there maybe a specific portion of CMS that you kind of want to let run off? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Kevin Berryman : So yes, there is a few contracts that we've had, which are going to be running off over the course of the first part of 2021 specifically, doesn't mean that we're not going to be able to show some growth. And especially I would focus the commentary more on bottom line as opposed to top line relative to that dynamic, Joe. So I think that the margin profile that we've been talking about, we do believe we're going to start to see some fundamental benefits of that in a more material manner as we enter into 2021. And so while the revenue could face some flattish kind of pressure over the short term, I think ultimately we're going to be in a position where as these new kind of projects and programs come into play with the associated ramp up in revenue and margin associated with those, you'll start to see that really play out in a nice way as we progress through 2021. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of [Jim] Cook from Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : I guess a couple of questions. One, you know, at your Analyst Day in 2019, I think you talked about sort of $7 to $8 earnings power potential for the company, understanding that\u2019s not in the cards for 2021. Can you just give us sort of your updated view on, is there a bridge to get there past 2021 and what would have to happen for you guys to get there? And then I guess my second question, obviously, the cash flow in the quarter was positive. Kevin, can you just help us understand where you think DSOs can go sort of over the next sort of 12 to 18 months and you know, just how you're thinking about cash flow opportunities, to improve cash flow conversion more consistently? Thank you. Steve Demetriou : I'll take the first one Kevin and then why don\u2019t you build on it. So Jamie, with regard to the 2019 strategy, I really think the best answer is the fundamentals of that strategy are solid. And if anything have been strengthened as we continue to diversify the company and bring innovative solutions. And it's just as you suggested, it's just moved to the right. And obviously, funding is going to play a key component on some elements of it but we're very confident, that's again just a matter of timing and that we're going to see the growth. But when you look at our critical mission solutions business and our people and places solutions, I just look at the 2019 strategy that led to that $7 to $8 outlook and feel very confident that that's still out there for us in the near-term. And as we progress and to given some guidance for '21 and I'm sure we\u2019ll also kind of give some update overall on the timing of that question. Kevin? Kevin Berryman : So let me add some comments to Steve\u2019s comments. Just reminding Jamie and I think you're already sensitized to as the $7 to $8 was a potential earnings potential, which assumed that we would fully utilize the strength of our balance sheet in some manner, shape or form. And I think that clearly, as I just communicated, the strength of the balance sheet is as robust as it ever has been and consequently, those opportunities to utilize capital longer term are to fundamentally increase our growth potential is certainly there. So I would just make that comment. And that it's going to be conditioned upon the utilization of the balance sheet. I think clearly COVID is, has required us to step back and reflect and make sure we're taking care of business and we'll continue to do that. But I think that clearly longer term no change, I would say versus our ability to get to those kind of figures over the period of time that we will be talking about as we think about over the next year or two, or thereabout. The other point I would say on the DSOs, look COVID is putting some challenges in place for us as it relates to the DSOs. So if you go and you think about where we progressed or not over the course of 2021, we have had some challenges in the 2020 periods. And I think that we're just going to have to continue to focus on that get back to it. Certainly, there could be some pockets of disruption in areas where it would be tough to get back at those until there is greater visibility in terms of some of the underlying sectors of which we're supporting but we do believe we have that ability. And so couple of three days adds up to some pretty significant figures in terms of our improvements in cash flow. And we would expect that as we get through COVID, I'm not going to say exactly when that will be and when our customers are back kind of without being impacted by some of the dynamics, certainly, we feel like we're going to be able to get those numbers down by those levels and then some longer term to help us get to the conversion numbers that we would like. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from Benchmark. Josh Sullivan : On the defense contracting environment, you mentioned you've adjusted your G&A. How has the defense customer responded to that? Are they accepting COVID pass-throughs? And then also curious if there\u2019s increased costs plus additional remote working, has had any impact on the government's perspective on low cost, technically acceptable bids versus the more value added technology enabled approaches you guys are starting to put forward? Bob Pragada : So I think that -- I\u2019ll answer the second part first, Josh, is that we do see that the value added in the differentiated solution is being accepted by our government client. As a differentiated solution, the natural if you look at what happened during the last dislocation or the global financial crisis, there was a trend more towards acceptable low bid. We haven't seen that yet. So I think that kind of plays to where we sit in the value trajectory. First part on some of the, when I say stimulus, some of the continuing efforts to keep our people going on critical efforts. I think that's a testament again to our portfolio. If you look at each sector that we're serving, it's not everybody that in the defense contracting community received the CARES 3610 type of compensation. We did, just because of how critical our services are with our government client. So we like our positioning of where we sit in the defense focused areas right now. Josh Sullivan : And then you guys have a very unique perspective of the global infrastructure environment. Just curious if you could just give us a sense of what the typical cost of designing in and securing against COVID is for the customer versus maybe that same project was without COVID productions a year ago? Bob Pragada : So Josh, I'd say that with our clients, we don't go after a lot of newer clients. So if you look at the major public agencies that we do work for, whether it\u2019d be in the U.S. on state DOTs or big water agencies, UK, Australia, these are clients that we\u2019d have larger framework agreements with pre-established commercial arrangements. And so going back to Michael Dudas' first question what we've seen is is a use of that platform, that framework agreements that were already in place so any type of pricing pressures we haven't seen as far as the clients having to spend more dollars in order to get that work done. I think those vehicles are helping the client as well, because that cost of procurement that we talk about it from a supply chain standpoint having those agreements in place has helped the clients as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : So we talk a lot about the interruption from physical distancing, but maybe not as much about the positive impacts that the pandemic could have on Jacobs. We talked about life science potential but could you talk about how your customers are reacting to the potential for re-shoring and bolstering supply chains in general and how Jacobs could be involved there? And then how work from home could potentially lower longer term costs for Jacobs in terms of mainly the potential to lower physical real estate costs as you go into FY21? Steve Demetriou : As far as the pandemic and the impact on our business, it's pretty widespread and there's a lot of opportunities there. Bob talked a lot about the life sciences side. When you look at the whole future of work, and I'll come back to the sort of the Jacobs opportunity. But the demand opportunity now that's out there for, we would say, we're in the whole supply chain of the digitization, massive change in the economy around digitization is, our industry leading position around semiconductor work, our mission critical data centers better accelerating and the whole race for 5G, all three of those areas we\u2019re a critical player in. And we\u2019ve clearly seen the fact with more virtual work, more streaming and online gaming, et cetera, that whole drive is going to increase the need for semiconductor capacity, data center capacity and 5G is another big example around a whole advanced facilities business. As it relates to Jacobs, we've commented that we had been working on a future of work strategy over the next several years prior to COVID-19. Our ability to rapidly shift to 85 plus percent of our employees and maintain strong productivity and be able to demonstrate that we not only can deliver projects but win business in that area is accelerating now, our work around, looking at what we can do, starting as early as 2021. And so we have a team looking at that. That's where we commented we'll be updating over the next several quarters of what that looks like, what the timing is, but we're very excited about next phase in our transformation journey around accelerating future work. Kevin Berryman : I was just going to say we were planning to give an update on those efforts as we close out the fiscal 2020 year, and what the potential implications would be for 2021. Andy Kaplowitz : And there's an obvious follow-up there just in terms of revenue visibility. I know Michael asked the question. Let me ask it in a different way. As you sit here today, you mentioned pro forma backlog growth is up 4%. You have say strong book-to-bill in both segments. There's some question of whether PPS needs help from stimulus or new infrastructure bill, but you've got there's advanced facility stuff that we just talked about. So can you talk about your confidence in revenue growth in \u201821? Obviously, you've seen confident EBITDA and EPS growth. But in revenue growth in both segments? Kevin Berryman : I think our belief is that absent in any substantive stimulus that comes into play, and this is not the only the U.S. but there are other regions around the globe in the UK and Australia specifically where we would be watching those areas closely. Look, I think we have a portfolio that's stable and has the ability to continue to build capabilities and deliver solutions to our clients. I think that as we think about that dynamic, we could see some growth in 2021 absent. But I think ultimately our belief is that stimulation there will be something as it relates to that and that probably results in the back half of 2021 being that much more stronger than the beginning parts of it. But I think that clearly the resiliency of our portfolio was we would suggest that we have the ability to grow in 2021. Bob Pragada : Andy, if I could just add one more to your, the re-shoring comment, because it's an important one ad it goes to what Kevin and Steve are saying. I'd look at it from this dynamic. All of our larger, and those are we call them core, clients we've been with for decades. They're going through, clearly, there's a headline news on re-shoring. But think about it from a two step process. All of these clients are also looking at their product portfolio mix and then looking at the re-shoring aspect of that supply chain from the learnings of now countries being blocked during the pandemic. And so I would kind of characterize that as early innings. But with probably some optimism that that's going to be real as these two parallel efforts are going on at the same time. Operator : And your next question is from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Just wanted to follow up on some of the earlier questions, specifically thinking about revenue growth next year at CMS, you called out the transition on the one contract. Maybe if you could just quantify what the known headwinds are into next year and then if you could also maybe calibrate just on recompetes, you know, what percentage of sales are up for recompete in \u201821 or between now and the end of \u201821 and you know, what percentage of revenues therefore are vulnerable in \u201821 to recompetes? Thank you. Steve Demetriou : Let me start Keven and then maybe you can give whatever guides you want on the quantification of revenue. But \u201821 is going to be a fairly light year to almost down to one or two recompete. So it's a very immaterial effect for us in 2021. And so from a revenue standpoint, we don't see risk around that. In fact, we're excited about some initiatives that others are looking at the recompetes that we're hopefully going to gain some share on. But Kevin, do you want to talk about the revenue question? Kevin Berryman : There's basically two things that are out there. We've had very large procurement revenue in 2020, which has actually dampened our margin profile. We've talked about that over the course of this fiscal year that will be transitioning off the books over the course of the first part of, the first half of 2021. And then of course depending upon how Hanford plays out, the Hanford Plateau project, obviously, will be off the books over the course of 2021, that assumes that the current protest dynamic doesn't change any material direction there. So those are numbers that will be plus $500 million certainly over the course of the full year, and we'll see how that plays out. But I think what I would suggest to you is the strength of the pipeline in our minds overcomes that number and ultimately starts to drive incremental profitability, because the procurement in Hanford Plateau are obviously lower parts of our margin profile. So that goes away, pipeline comes in and replaces it and margin goes up all at the same time, resulting in good operating profit growth. Gautam Khanna : And I was hoping maybe you can actually quantify the higher procurement sort of pass through stuff this year, how much is sort of non-recurring. And then relatedly bookings in the September quarter, obviously, off to a good start. Maybe can you give us a sense for what just based on when the adjudications lie, how the bookings outlook at CMS looks the next September, December quarters, kind of what you're expecting as potentials in terms of book-to-bill? Steve Demetriou : Kevin maybe I\u2019ll start. Just building on Kevin\u2019s pipeline comment and what Bob talked about earlier on protests. So, we're getting off to a fast start, first and foremost, because some things we want in the third quarter are not on the books yet as it relates to our book-to-bill and our bookings and backlog. And so that, when you look at, first of all, when you look at those two initiatives but maybe Kings Bay and the NORAD wins, you put that into with everything else we won in the third quarter and the book-to-bill was strong in critical mission solutions. Our pipeline is at a record high, significant increase from where it was a year ago when we look at our current CMS pipeline of $30 billion. And when you look at the margin in that pipeline, it's exciting. And the things we've just recently announced are all margin enhancement, along of course with the Wood acquisition and KeyW acquisition as those continue to ramp up. So, as Kevin said that you put all that together, this is for us, a great transition that we're going through that's consistent with our strategy that we outlined of growing the business but enhancing the margins at the same time. And we feel confident that that's playing out now as we get into 2021 and beyond. And so, Kevin or Bob, anything to add to that? Kevin Berryman : No, I think Steve, I think the first quarter will look solid. And as far as that hovering at one or above is very much within reach, we've got a nice pipeline. Operator : And your next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS. Steven Fisher : So you talked a few months ago about EBITDA growing in 2021, and you've reiterated it here today. I'm just curious how the drivers of that growth changed in the last few months or so, to what extent maybe is it more margin driven now rather than revenue, inorganic versus organic, or any particular program that maybe driving it now that were different than you were thinking a few months ago? Steve Demetriou : Well, let me just qualitatively say that some things that sort of help us make that comment about growth next year are most two recent acquisitions we made, KeyW and Wood, are clearly going to contribute to some of that growth next year. We've been doing very well on the KeyW acquisition around the cyber side and the mission IT side. As we've talked about this great opportunity we have on space intelligence has moved to the right a bit where it underperformed this year, but everything is still standing there with regard to the great opportunity. And we have two specific initiatives that we're moving through and we expect to drive growth next year around that whole space intelligence side of KeyW, along with the other two businesses. So we're very positive about that business. Wood Nuclear, combination with Jacobs, we're going to see the majority of the synergies next year around the cost synergies, as well as some revenue synergies. So those two businesses are going to contribute. We're going to have kind of some balancing things going on on the cost side as we resume some discretionary spending that we temporarily halted but at the same time, we have some initiatives underway where we're going to see some productivity and efficiency coming in with some of the things that we've initially talked about with future of work, et cetera. And then the rest of it is really driven by just a continuation of what we've talked about of being aligned to the secular trends that are moving in the right direction, national security, water infrastructure, water still is -- we're very bullish on, environmental resiliency, of course the whole healthcare and life sciences. We've been talking a lot about the intelligent asset management side on critical mission solutions that the three Navy wins over the last 12 to 18 months margin enhancement profit growth, and then, of course, this whole race to the Artemis 2024 space exploration side of things and add on top of that, the digital initiatives that we're working across both businesses but really the drivers of what we're talking about. Steven Fisher : And then maybe Kevin, I\u2019m curious what's the shape of how that 4% decline in pro forma revenues trends over the next handful of quarters. Should we assume that that remains negative through the fiscal first quarter of next year and then it starts to turn positive, or is that more like a second half of '21? Any thoughts on kind of the shape of that recovery. Kevin Berryman : Probably not going to give you specifics relative to it, but I do think certainly we're facing a more muted short-term dynamic versus longer term consistent with the comments that we've made. So probably not going to give you a lot of incremental color but certainly, we're going to be more muted in the short-term. Certainly, I would say as it relates to the Q4 numbers, certainly we're going to be thinking about that relative to the numbers. And so maybe I'll leave it there and then we'll play out and give you more perspectives as we enter into 2021 after we finish up Q4 and have another three months under our belt relative to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operator : And your last question comes from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Michael Feniger : I know you said you expect some federal support on the PPS side. But before we get to November elections, there's a Fast Act expiring at the end of September. The recent Republican stimulus proposal really lacked aid for the state and local municipalities. So I'm just curious what is kind of the base assumption here? Can you guys grow, if there is a CR one year extension maybe and they just kind of punt to November? Maybe you could just flesh out your exposure by states and what you're seeing there. Are some states showing more than others, are they accessing rainy day funds? Clarity on that will be helpful. Bob Pragada : The short answer, Michael, is that we're going to be solid. As far as tangible anticipated growth pre-pandemic, clearly, we're kind of in the new norm now. But when I say solid and when I'm saying solid, I'm talking about Michael in the event that there isn't agreement and we're moving towards an election. And it goes back to my earlier comment around the strength of our backlog and programs that have already, not only been approved but also funded and are a part of current state budgets that we don't see any reallocation going on there. So that's in the event. Now, the Fast Act line item, though, you mentioned it\u2019s not in the Republican proposal, it is in the democratic, as well as it could be a negotiating tool as well. So I think it's too early to make an assessment on that. As far as areas that give us that confidence. If you look at what kind of our main centers of really strong presence, these are household names that do have surpluses as it pertains to certain, I\u2019m speaking mostly on the transportation side even with revenues coming down from a user fees perspective, California, Texas, Southeast United States. And so those programs that were in our backlog and continue to be awarded, we're seeing very close to our clients and those are going to continue. How fast and how much they grow, we're still in the middle of that right now. Operator : And I'll now turn the call over to your CEO for closing remarks. Steve Demetriou : All right. So thanks, everyone. Look, the past five months as the pandemic increased in intensity, we kept our focus on our people. The culture of caring that we've talked about is part of our D&A. Today's launch of our action plan for advancing justice and equality is our next phase, it\u2019s our call to action and direct response to the recent social and racial injustices and actions that go beyond words of rhetoric and actions we hope others will do the same. As we look at our business, these last two quarters have proven the resiliency of our company to stay the course, drive results in times of uncertainty, the diversity of our end markets, the strong foundation, the strong global teams, have all held firm. And looking forward, the highly recurring nature of our work provides us some good visibility into our business opportunities and we expect to grow EBITDA in 2021. Thank you and good luck.

Steve Demetriou : Thank you, John. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 business performance and strategy update. We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy as the pandemic continues to impact all facets of our daily lives and our loved ones. As we work with our pharma supply chain to support the development and distribution of a vaccine, we must not lose sight of the severity of the situation globally. Here at Jacobs, aligned with our core value of we do things right, we will continue to prioritize the health of our employees and our communities. During this pandemic, we have prudently adjusted our cost structure while continuing key strategic investments to position Jacobs to accelerate growth as the economy recovers. We have continued to take deliberate strategic actions to drive inclusivity and diversity of thought across Jacobs as well as making targeted investments to accelerate our digital capabilities. We strongly believe these investments position Jacobs to capture a compelling growth opportunity to emerge as a uniquely positioned strategic consultant and delivery partner across a diverse set of sectors where we have deep domain expertise. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 7 to review our Critical Mission Solutions performance. During the fourth quarter, our CMS business performed well, demonstrating CMS' resiliency and alignment to the diverse set of high-value sectors we serve, such as national security, space exploration, intelligence, nuclear life cycle solutions and the deployment of 5G infrastructure. Total CMS backlog is at $9.1 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis and does not include our previously awarded King's Bay intelligent asset management win, which we fully expect a clear protest in early April. Importantly, approximately half of our bookings during the fourth quarter were from new business. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the fourth quarter. Before I begin, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 included an extra week compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. While this impact was factored into our guidance, it represented approximately $100 million in a year-over-year net revenue tailwind for each of CMS and People & Places. Fourth quarter gross revenue, as a result, increased 4% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue up 2%. People & Places net revenue was up 8% year-over-year, and Critical Mission Solutions declined 3.6% on a pro forma basis. The CMS decline was mainly attributed to the early impact from transitioning off of two lower margin contracts, as I will explain later, in more detail. It is important to note CMS operating profit on a pro forma basis increased 14% year-over-year. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.5% down 135 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin was driven by a combination of factors primarily within People & Places, including overall revenue mix, the comparison versus a very strong year-ago quarter, the impact of some project closeout costs and the previously discussed flow-through effect of the reimbursable rate of a more efficient fixed cost structure in the LOB. The lower reimbursement rate for fixed cost is more than offset by the underlying lower level of G&A costs. This impact to reimbursable rates from our cost structure is also reflected, and overall, lower G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 100 basis points year-over-year to 14.4%. As it pertains to G&A, the fourth quarter continued to benefit from low travel and employee-related medical costs. GAAP operating profit was $22 million and included $211 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, of which the vast majority was associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $24 million of other charges consisting of $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $1 million of costs associated with the Worley transition services agreement. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $258 million, up 2% from the prior year figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, a result of the lower People & Places margins discussed earlier. This was partially offset by improved critical emissions margins and flat year-over-year unallocated corporate expense. I'll discuss the underlying drivers of these costs on the line of business review slide. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $70 million and $0.53 per share and included $1.22 per share of after tax restructuring, transaction and other charges, as noted above, an amortization charge of acquired intangibles of $0.13, both of which were partially offset by a $0.34 net benefit, largely driven by the mark-to-market adjustments associated with our Worley equity stake. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.63, including a $0.24 benefit from discrete tax items. Excluding these discrete great tax items in both the current and year ago quarter, underlying adjusted EPS was essentially flat year-over-year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $277 million and was up 1% year-over-year, reaching 9.8% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 for Q4, driven by solid bookings from both lines of business. As Bob noted, the over $400 million previously awarded Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management win remains in protest, and as a result, is excluded from our backlog figures. We expect to be notified of our resolution mid fiscal year 2021. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by strong new business dynamics within Critical Mission Solutions. We believe nearly all of the opportunities we are pursuing have strong bipartisan support as they are high-priority areas associated with national security. We believe that the People & Places Solutions business overall sales pipeline also supports strong long-term growth. We continue to see changes in the underlying composition and timing of opportunities driven by a more environmentally friendly U.S. administration as well as covered related impacts. Turning to Slide 10. Let me summarize our fiscal 2020 performance. For the full year, revenue increased 7% and net revenue increased 2.5% pro forma for the Wood Nuclear acquisition. GAAP operating profit was $536 million, and adjusted operating profit was $970 million, up 9% versus the year ago figures. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.05 billion and increased 7%, reaching 9.6% of net revenue. Our fiscal year 2020 book-to-bill was 1.07 times. And before leaving our consolidated annual results, I would like to make some summary comments regarding our first half and second half performance. Fiscal 2020 has been defined by a year of two very different halves. Prior to COVID, our first half performance was indicative of strong momentum, with pro forma growth net revenue growth of over 6% and double-digit pro forma operating profit growth, resulting in operating profit margins up 50 basis points year-over-year. As the pandemic took hold, our teams quickly adjusted plans for the second half of the year as we've recognized that physical distancing and economic disruption would impact our earlier revenue momentum. Revenue ended up being relatively flat in the second half versus both the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020, indicating the resilience of our portfolio. Importantly, our teams were able to successfully manage to a lower cost structure than our original plan with costs reduced over $100 million during the second half versus our original plan. The agility of our teams to adjust rapidly was profound, and we are proud of them for having successfully mitigated the economic disruption to the Company and the impact to our clients. So regarding our LOB, let's turn to the Slide 11. Starting with CMS, as expected, pro forma revenue declined 3.6% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact from the two large lower margin contracts we are transitioning off and the benefit of the extra week of revenue, growth would have also been down low single digits year-over-year, driven by the impacts associated with COVID-19. While revenue was down, CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 14% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, with operating profit margin up 140 basis points year-over-year to 8.1%. Even factoring in the extra week in the fourth quarter, operating profit would have increased high single digits year-over-year. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities with some additional benefit from favorable project closeouts. From a full year perspective, pro forma revenue was down 1%, and operating profit on a pro forma basis increased 8%. Operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 7.5% from fiscal 2019 against -- again, consistent with our strategy consistent with our strategy to expand our CMS margins. Looking into fiscal 2021, we expect CMS reported net revenue to be up low single digits as we ramp new wins and benefit from newly acquired higher margin revenue. Given the strategy to capture higher value opportunities and the benefit from acquisitions, we expect reported operating profit growth to be up double digits. We do believe that the improvements will be more back half-oriented given the impact from the two lower margin contracts will be more than offset with the new higher-margin business later in the second half. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q4 net revenue was up 8% year-over-year but would have been relatively flat, excluding the benefit of the extra week during the fourth quarter. Operating profit was down 8% year-over-year. And as a percentage of net revenue, operating profit was 12.2% for the quarter, down over 210 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by COVID-related headwinds in the quarter, some project closeout costs and the strong -- very strong year-ago quarter, which benefited from project closeout benefits. From a full year perspective, PPS net revenue was up 6%, with operating profit up 4%, reaching an operating profit margin of 12.4%, slightly down versus a year ago due to pressure associated with COVID-19 in the second half. Looking forward, we expect People & Places revenue to be up low single digits for fiscal 2021, with relatively flat growth in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect operating profit margin as a percent of net revenue to increase modestly from fiscal 2020, given the higher-margin mix in our sales pipeline and lower costs from our focused -- Focus 2023 initiatives. These benefits will be largely offset in 2021 by additional costs as we transition from cost mitigation efforts executed during the second half of fiscal 2020 to a more sustainable cost structure in 2021 and beyond associated with driving profitable growth. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, flat from the year ago period. On an annual basis, non-allocated corporate costs were $143 million, up 9% year-over-year. Looking forward to 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher, driven mainly by inflation and medical costs, improved employee benefits and an increase in employee discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 due to COVID-19 concerns. Now turning to Slide 12. I would like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integration. As Steve discussed, the pandemic has fundamentally changed nearly all facets of the economy, which has provided us the ability to challenge our current processes to reinvest how we deliver solutions to our customers in the future. During Q4, we formed a dedicated internal team with assistance from an external adviser to examine the future work and other transformational opportunities. We are embarking upon a strategic initiative, Focus 2023, that we believe will lead to enhanced employee experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth, high-margin opportunities and drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for improved longer-term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred a nearly $200 million charge related to our Focus 2023 initiative, of which there was only $1 million in cash outflow during the quarter. Of the charge, approximately 80% was related to noncash real estate lease impairments as we plan to decrease our fiscal footprint by over 30%. The remainder of the costs was related to strategically leaning out the organization. In 2021, we project that we will have more than another $30 million in one-time costs associated with our Focus 2023 initiative. Our initiative has already generated approximately $75 million in quick win cost savings in fiscal 2021. This is allowing the Company to offset the incremental cost noted earlier expected in fiscal 2021 as compared to our lower cost structure associated with our COVID mitigation efforts in fiscal year 2020. In addition, it's expected that the run rate of these quick wins will provide another $25 million in savings in 2022 as we realize the full annual run rate benefits into the next year. Beyond these quick one savings, we believe there are substantial additional benefits approaching another $100 million into 2022 and 2023, which we will believe support incremental investments that will accelerate our growth and drive towards a more digital, innovative company that provides unique value-added solutions to our clients. We will provide additional detail of our Focus 2023 initiative during our expected Investor Day in the first half of calendar year 2021 and provide an update on our FY '21 Q1 earnings call. Now turning to our acquisition of Wood's Nuclear business. We are on track to achieve our targeted $12 million in run rate cost savings and the business continues to perform in line with our original target despite top line headwinds from headwinds from physical distancing. And finally, the acquisition of The Buffalo Group was announced today. While terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the acquisition is expected to deliver $0.08 to $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. And the cost of the acquisition adjusted EBITDA when including the tax benefits from the acquisition. And finally, when including all initiatives, including Focus 2023 and all M&A efforts, we expect the total estimated amount of approximately $80 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows during fiscal 2021. Now on to cash flow generation and the balance sheet on Slide 13. During the quarter, we generated $403 million in free cash flow as a result of very strong collections and lower headwinds from cash restructuring. Q4 cash flow included a positive $23 million of net one-time benefits primarily due to a pandemic related cash tax deferral, partly offset by headwinds from cash outflows associated with restructuring and other items. For fiscal year 2020, we generated $689 million in free cash flow above our original expectation. Our annual free cash flow included $10 million of net nonrecurring outflows. When excluding this $10 million net headwind for the full year, the Company delivered a 96% free cash flow conversion to our adjusted net income figure for the year, demonstrating the strong free cash flow capabilities of the business. Over the medium term, we continue to target 100% conversion of recurring cash flow from adjusted net earnings. As previously stated, we expect approximately $110 million cash outflows related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring and integration during fiscal 2021. We also expect a reversal of pandemic-related UK payroll tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2020 of at least $40 million. That results in an expected total headwind of $150 million of cash outflows in the fiscal year 2021, including these one-time items. DSO performance in Q4 was the major driver to our improved free cash flow improvement, down almost nine days, excuse me, from 3Q 2020 as many of the collection process improvement initiatives implemented gain traction. We are focused on maintaining this lower DSO level, which will be a major driver to our ability to deliver a 1x free cash flow conversion target long term. And now moving to the balance sheet. Given the strong free cash flow for the quarter and year, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $900 million and a gross debt of $1.7 billion, resulting in $800 million in net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley equity. Treating the Worley equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.5 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regarding capital deployment, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million worth of our shares. For modeling purpose, we would expect an average share count of $131 million for the first quarter 2021 and fiscal year 2021, excluding additional material share buyback activity. Of course, as Steve noted in his opening comments, our plan is to proactively deploy our capital as we plan for the transition out of a COVID-19 environment. Regarding our effective tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the fiscal 2021 year, in line with our longer-term normalized adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased earlier this year and declared at $0.19 per share. As you know, our current dividend level represents an increase of 12% versus a year ago. Now, I'll turn it back over to Steve for our outlook and closing comments on Slide 14. Steve Demetriou : All right. Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.055 billion to $1.155 billion, which represents year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be a range of $5.20 to $6. It's important to note that our guidance does not include any benefit from material future share repurchase activity. We do expect to fully utilize our balance sheet capacity over time through share repurchases or acquisitions that provide returns in excess of back. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth to rebound to double-digit adjusted EBITDA as we benefit from our Focus 2023 initiative as well as potential infrastructure-related stimulus and economic recovery. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator :  Thank you. Our first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Steve Demetriou : Good morning, Jerry. Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Bob Pragada : Good morning. Jerry Revich : Can you expand on Focus 2023 initiative? I'm sure we'll hear more at the Analyst Day, but just touch on what are the additional pillars beyond the cost reductions that we're talking about here? And Kevin, maybe just a clarification, how much of the $200 million savings do you expect to reinvest in digital when we look at it on a run rate basis in 2023? What's going to be the net number we should keep in mind? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Jerry, just sort of at a high level, the two major pillars, really, and the first one is really growth. It's all about driving the next-generation technology growth. We've obviously learned a lot over this past 10 months, 11 months with what happened during the pandemic, and it's really given us tremendous opportunity to accelerate our solution set across a variety of sectors that Bob really covered in both LOBs. And the second pillar is delivering our work more efficiently, effectively. We have a huge opportunity with what we outlined with regard to the way we're going to have a much more dynamic operating model moving forward with flexible workspace, continued remote working. So, a significant opportunity to reduce cost, but that goes far beyond just the real estate and travel. It's really back office efficiency, procurement and a whole host of other things that should deliver significant cost savings. So, those are sort of the combinations that -- again together unleashes a growth trajectory for Jacobs moving forward. Kevin, on -- some more on the financial side. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Jerry, so if you think about the savings associated with the Focus 2023, I already quoted some of the numbers, but to note that couple of hundred million dollars, almost $200 million of one-time costs that's primarily associated with lease impairment cost non-cash charge. And if you think about what that translates into in terms of the reduction in the -- let's call it the real estate costs going forward, it's roughly $35 million, of which, the vast majority is associated with a reduction in lease costs. So, as you think about that, there is obviously much more savings on top of that, which totaled to the $75 million we talked about with a run rate of an additional $100 million. Those are related to the initiatives about leaning out the organization and the efficiencies gained with ultimately the investments in tools and capabilities and training associated with the Focus '23. It is really clear that we've learned a ton during these last nine months and we're taking full advantage of that and being proactive and leaning forward to, to help take these learnings and create something even better for ourselves and our clients, and our people going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open. Joseph DeNardi : Thanks, good morning. I guess for Kevin, Steve mentioned making progress on the margin targets. Can you remind us what those are at this point? I think at the Investor Day, it's kind of high-8s for CMS, low-13s for PPS. I don't know -- I don't think that FY 2021 guidance implies you get there next year. So, can you just kind of remind us where the targets are? What the timeline is? And I don't know what the earnings power is from all of what you're talking about here this morning? Kevin Berryman : Yes, look, I think as you -- before COVID, actually, the People & Places business was pretty much on target to deliver that, that kind of margin target in 2020 and then got disrupted little bit given the second-half of the year, Joe. But I think that at the end of the day, we're going to be right close to those kind of figures in 2020 -- 2021 fiscal year. On CMS, I think, we're going to be right there in terms of the margin targets that we had characterized back in 2016, kind of mid-8s, hopefully, maybe a little bit higher, but I think that that's what our expectations are for CMS. So, I think we're right there. You have noted in our comments that the CMS margins are going to be driven by a relatively lower revenue growth because we're working off some of these other longer-term contracts, but that could be replaced by a more robust margin profile business over the course of 2021, leading to a really strong margin profile consistent with what the original targets were for 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Just first question to follow-up on the question that was just asked. On the margins, you're talking about hitting the margin targets in 2021 that you laid out, I think, in 2019. But I guess, given the incremental $200 million plus in costs that we're taking, how do we think about the longer-term margin profile? Can we get better margins than what we laid out in 2019? Or do we need this to achieve that given COVID? And then my second question, any color that you can provide on the Buffalo acquisition in terms of how that business -- the organic sales growth or EBITDA or margin of that business? And I'm just trying to understand, excluding Buffalo, would you have grown your 2021 EBITDA year-over-year like you laid out earlier in the year? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Yes, just Jamie to start with -- hand it back to Kevin for maybe some more financial back up is that, yes, we expect the Focus 2023 to give us incremental margin improvement as we get beyond 2021. It's one of the major opportunities and objectives of that initiative. And the Buffalo acquisition is accretive to CMS margins. So, it's going to enhance that on top of what I just said. And so I think the combination of those two, as well as the backlog profile we have and looking at the -- some of the multi-year aspects of that backlog and the higher margins in the current backlog as we move forward, gives us confidence for multi-year margin improvement. Kevin? Kevin Berryman : I would echo the same thing, Steve, that you reemphasized the fact that the Focus 2023 really is while we're getting some cost efficiencies here that the intention is that we're going to be able to reinvest back into some of the digital capabilities that we know are there, which facilitate our ability to win solutions with our clients or deliver solutions to our clients that ultimately are associated with a higher margin profile. So, really is about growth, and it really is about a margin profile longer-term that we would expect to see upward trajectory versus kind of the 2021 figures. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna : Yes, hey, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Buffalo Group. If there are any small business set asides or items like that, that might be part of the retain over time? And if you could just broadly characterize the M&A pipeline from here how it looks in terms of number of properties and potential sizes that you're looking at? Bob Pragada : Adding to the first one, I missed the second part of the question. Could you repeat the second part? Gautam Khanna : Yes, sure. So, if you could characterize the M&A pipeline as it stands post Buffalo. What else is out there? If there's -- if that's a big part of the 2021 plan, further M&A? Bob Pragada : Okay, great. Yes, on the first one, the small business set asides we took a really strong look at that and these -- not just these recent awards, but then the trend that we see going forward with regards to the areas of the government that the Buffalo Group is involved with are full and open. So we don't really see that the small business set asides of the past affecting how we see the real synergies that the platform is going to bring to our overall business. So we're optimistic on that front, and then Steve, you want to add? Steve Demetriou : Yes, on the overall M&A pipeline, it's very consistent with what we've been talking about essentially going back to our 2019 strategy Investor Day, and that is as we just did with The Buffalo Group, we'll continue to look at ways to strengthen our government services business and move up the value chain there. From an overall Company standpoint, we've talked about digital consulting, strategic consulting becoming a bigger end-to-end player, especially on the front end, geographic expansion is another area. So, just very consist of staying core to our strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : Kevin, obviously you reported a strong free cash flow quarter, 96% adjusted free cash flow. Do you think Q4 was basically the inflection point toward generating strong free cash flow conversion going forward? And then why would conversion actually go down in FY '21, excluding one timers, which has gone off your range given all the work you've done with the improvement in collections and back office systems work you've done? Kevin Berryman : So, thanks for that question. I would say a couple things. One that I hope you're right that we will perform better than those numbers, first comment. But I think, as we think about the balance of next year, the back half of 2020 did have some challenges relative to our revenue being less robust than what we would originally assumed. So, as you think about the working capital dynamics associated with that number in the back half of the year, at the end there is some tailwinds, because we don't have as much of a bills and the working capital numbers in 2020. As we transition to 2021, and if we get to the conversion numbers we're actually talking to, actually we're making further improvements in DSOs because you're now facing an investment back into working capital. So, at the end of the day, we think it's a continuation of that journey to get to that one-time conversion number, which I've always kind of targeted the year 2022 as to getting there. Operator : Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Chad Dillard : So, what's embedded in your upper and lower end of the guidance range, ascribing the tax benefit '21 and rest of that '20, which suggests earnings at the low end of the '21 guide, in terms of inclusive of the $9 benefits from Buffalo, the Wood Group cost savings, just want to help bridging earnings from this past year into 2021. Kevin Berryman : Yes, Chad, let me take a crack at that and respond. Look, we recognize that our range here is relatively wide. But we also recognize that we continue to be in the midst of a pandemic. And while we feel really good of our ability to have done a great job in the second half of 2020 to mitigate some of the challenges associated with it, we still are in the midst of it. And so I think the low end of our range would be something that we hope never happens, but it would be a situation where the economics are challenged around the globe and that will have situation of that -- of that magnitude, which by the way still results in our ability to be flat versus year ago in a dire economic environment. That's how we would characterize the low end of our range. At the high end of the range, we're starting to be more optimistic as we come out of the dynamic associated with COVID and that we are developing the momentum that we actually think will happen into 2022 faster. So I think that's how we would characterize the range. I think we're being prudent by putting that range there and hopefully it gives you some constructive use as to see what the potential downside is under a pretty bad scenario and what the potential upside is under a good scenario. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. Just wondering if you can give a little more color on the cadence on the revenue and EPS guidance for fiscal '21? It sounds like perhaps Q1 revenues might be down kind of low single digits, but it's hard to tell how back-end weighted EPS is and how relatively light versus consensus Q1 might be. And also just trying to get a sense of sort of the revenue trajectory here, if something is selected more positively or just sort of like a normalizing kind of from a COVID situation? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Yes, Steven, this is Kevin. I'll just reinforce what I said earlier, I think the first half is more flattish relative to our net revenue figures and back half is less flat, it starts to show some momentum. And so I think that that's how we would see the cadence. We're still in the midst of the pandemic, certainly we feel like we're going to be holding serve relative to our first six months. And given all the strong work that we're doing on everything else, we're going to see some actual margin improvements and profit improvements in the first half, but the revenue cadence is probably little bit more flattish in the first half developing additional momentum in the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Michael Dudas : Maybe this for Bob, when you're looking out for 2021 in the PPS segment -- PP&S segment, characterize the different funding flows or expectations from the private sector and public sector clients. And it seems like you got some international momentum on that business. So I'd like to hear little more details on that? And maybe for Steve, you mentioned a couple of times in the presentation about positive aspect from the Biden Administration, are your clients -- is there a pent-up demand for things to get going again once some of the uncertainty with the election and COVID passes with the vaccine success, which I know you guys were involved with on the production side, is that really going to be that the kick of the inflection to see the growth in second half of '21, and going into '22? Thanks. Bob Pragada : Sure. Mike, let me just kind of take it one at a time. Private sector, you know it is really well long-term -- long-term relationships that we have with the private sector clients that we haven't. So if you look at what does that mean for Jacobs, predominantly in the manufacturing space as well as a bit on the environmental side with regards to other industrial clients, we're actually starting to see a bit of an uptick as those clients really look at not only the portfolio mix, but also how they reorganized their global supply chain as a result of the learnings from COVID. So a bit of -- it's -- and it kind of touches the profile of services that we offer. So we can help them with regards to conceptual planning and kind of looking at helping them solve those solutions with other innovations that we have on how they look at that. So on the private sector side, we're starting to see, we have visibility to where those will materialize into other downstream projects and we're in that phase right now. Public sector, steady business and that's a global comment and I'll come back to kind of a nuance between international and U.S., but we are seeing in the U.S. public sector is that the creativity that state and local government have already exhibited for the better part of the last three years to four years has continued, And with some of the extensions, whether it be continuing resolution extension within the government or it would be on the bond measures that have 31 of the 44 bond measures passed in this last election, they're utilizing those types of measures in order to continue on the projects, whether it be in transit or in water. Stimulus would be added to that, we monitor ourselves over what we could see. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the U.S. and the international side the stimulus money is already is -- we're starting to see some effect of that specifically in UK with the 10 point plan already starting to see some early planning work around that. And then in Australia, we're already starting to see some of the effects of those of those money flowing through. So overall we are well positioned for whichever -- whichever way the markets go. Steve Demetriou : Yes, Michael part two of your question, I think it's a combination of pent-up demand and accelerating demand over the course of the next 12 months to 24 months. And what I mean by that is pent-up side obviously things like the fact that the life science, pharma industry has been totally focused on COVID-19, but there's a whole host of opportunities there that they need to get back at around oncology and biotech, etc., you think of the whole aging infrastructure dynamics in the U.S. and the UK and other areas that have to be addressed. And I think those two regions specifically the government is now set up to hopefully live up to strong stimulus and funding around infrastructure the next several years. But then you've got the whole accelerating demand that we talked about, which is really driving our Focus 2023 initiative and that's that customers have now come to grips that they all have to get at this and accelerate their own technology platform and climate change issues and opportunities and so that accelerating demand opportunities is going to open up and expand our total available market and create significant opportunity for Jacobs. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Just as we think about -- thinks of this migration sort of more up market, higher margin business mix over time, just curious how you'd reflect on the win rate in some of those higher margin adjacencies through fiscal '20? And as you think about Focus 2023 does that program potentially drive that adjacent market win rate materially higher over time? Steve Demetriou : Yes. Let me, at a high level again and it's great that you asked that question because it feeds right into the whole Focus 2023 initiative. It is all about moving into more and more higher value markets that we believe have a long runway of opportunity and so it's, when we talk about connectivity and climate change resiliency what's going to -- the whole dynamic of what's going to happen with healthcare moving forward and really all aspects of both our Critical Mission Solutions and People & Places Solutions business it's exactly what fits into what is the question that you asked, is that it is going to be moving into the higher market opportunities. And as I just answered the previous question, we believe that the total market that we're going to be going after over the next several years is going to be significantly expanded versus what we've been addressing over the last, say, five years because of the whole technology dynamics that have evolved over the last 12 months. Bob, do you want to kind of give some specific examples around that? Bob Pragada : Yes, absolutely. Just to add on to what Steve as told, the win rates have been high and we expect them to be -- continue to be higher, but the client challenge is if you look at five years ago versus now, the current challenges are the same. These other dynamics that Steve was mentioning, or accentuating them. And so those challenges now need a different type of solution, which is where Focus 2023 comes into play. So an example, if -- one of the big areas that we have going on right now is around the use of hydrogen power, I'm sorry, hydrogen as a synthetic fuel and really addressing the decarbonization efforts that are going on both in the UK, the U.S., Australia, all over the world and whether it be for power generation for automotive, for ships, for airplanes, to power residential communities, it's across the board and Jacobs is right in the middle of all of that. So again the challenge of the stray away from fossil fuels, not a new one, but now with the advent of hydrogen and other synthetic fuels and the use of technology on how that support, something that we're right in the cross areas of. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Co. Your line is now open. Josh Sullivan : Hi, good morning. Just on the virtualized environment, how do you differentiate Jacobs brand and recruit employees. Just as the friction for high value talent, it comes down with more virtualization kind of across the board. Can you just give us your thoughts on how Jacobs wins out? Could we see pricing competition for some high value talent and some of these green infrastructure areas go up? Or do you think you can access more talent globally, maybe push some of those acquisitions\u2019 costs down? Just curious what Jacobs has seen in this virtualized environment? Bob Pragada : Great question. And it's the -- war on the talent hasn't slowed at all during the pandemic, that's for sure, but a couple of responses there. One is that we've used the word global integrated delivery, global connectedness, that matters. The folks that we see coming into the job force today are they care about what's going on globally and want to work on really, really neat stuff and that's a great attraction to Jacobs where if I may, either I'd spent half of my career in the mechanical engineering field or new graduate, but yet, I can use my domain expertise and now -- and now work on projects that are effectively changing the face of the world. Then I don't know of another recruiting tool that we could use as that. The virtual aspect of that, I talked about the positive, the other side of that ledger is that the demands on leadership become even higher because in a virtual world we need to make sure that we stay connected to our people and Steve and Kevin in the entire leadership team have really put a high level of focus on making sure that our newer employees feel connected to the culture of Jacobs through everything from town halls to increased communication etc. So there is a balance and it is a new world that we're really excited about. Steve Demetriou : Yes, one thing Josh to augment Bob's comment is our attrition rates have continued to be very, very attractive and following. Now some of that could be affected and impacted by COVID, but the reality is with you -- with us being able to deliver, really, really good performance on lowering attrition rates it puts less pressure on attracting new talent, which is obviously a good thing from an economic perspective and capability perspective given our teams. So it works in a circular manner. In terms of focusing on our culture, making people excited and that ultimately translates to a really good picture going forward in terms of gaining access to talent. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Your line is now open. Andrew Wittmann : Great, thanks. It is probably for Kevin. I guess I just want to understand the some of the moving pieces on the corporate cost related to fiscal '21, because I heard that there is already $75 million of kind of quick wins, I think you term then -- I think that -- I have to imagine $35 million of annual lease costs are part of that. I guess my question is, how much do you estimate that the headwind is from the low-cost in 2020? I guess you kind of talked about the fact that there was some deferred healthcare things because of COVID, other things like that that could be lower than expected SG&A in 2020. So I guess I'm just trying to understand if there is a net benefit from the actions that you've already taken here in early 2021 to deliver. I guess EBITDA dollar growth for those cost actions. Then I guess there is a similar implication, your question on 2020. It sounds like there is a good deal of reinvestment planned against that. I was hoping to I guess ask the separate ways, is there as you look to '22 and '23 as part of the three-year plan, is there a net benefit or do you expect that the majority of these savings will get reinvested? Kevin Berryman : So that was a big question. And let me let me kind of parse it apart. So yes, the incremental cost that we are seeing in 2021 are a function of as we now see the light at the end of the tunnel relative to the COVID situation we're positioning ourselves to be reinvesting back into the business to accelerate our ability to deliver profitable growth as we exit this year and into 2022 and beyond. So that's a very clearly the case. And so if you think about that effectively what I guess I'd reemphasize, what I said during the prepared remarks was effectively that $75 million is offsetting some of these kind of come back in costs for 2021. And so as we go then into 2022 and beyond clearly Focus 2023 allows us to deliver incremental benefits and from our perspective, the way that we're envisioning that is, that gives us degrees of freedom to really significantly invest in some of the digitization, training, capability sets for us to deliver the next wave of innovative solutions that are higher margin and deliver even special more special solution to the clients. So as we sit here today, we say look we're going to invest back those incremental monies, but of course each of those incremental investments are going to have to have a return profile that makes sense from a shareholder perspective and if they don't, maybe some of that drops to the bottom line. But our attention on Focus 2023 really is about profitable higher margin growth going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I know we're running a little long. So I'll try to keep it short. Just first off with the pent-up demand that you guys are talking about, have you seen anything on the public or private side, with booking just start to fall in November after the election? Steve Demetriou : Michael, when you say fall, you mean to be awarded? Michael Feniger : Yes. If there was any fall or any pick up, you guys saw on bookings after the election increase of customer inquiries. Did anything really change in November that gives you guys confidence on the second half? Steve Demetriou : I don't know if it was directly affect -- I don't know if it was directly tied to the election, but we continue to see positive momentum in our bookings. Now is that coincidence if they were tied to November election or not, but probably not probably not appropriate for us to speculate on that. Programs have been coming in, we talked about the pipeline, the pipeline continues to be robust and we continue to win a fair share of those. So yes, I think they are two independent events. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open. Joseph DeNardi : Thanks. Bob, there is a bullet on CMS slide that says KeyW geospatial technology for confidential commercial customer, that sounds kind of exciting. Can you talk about what that is? Maybe what that pretends for some of the government-related pursuit that KeyW was involved with geospatial? Thank you. Bob Pragada : Joe, I got to be really careful with this one. It is a -- it is confidential, it's in the automotive sector and it really starts to rely on deep space satellite technology in order to advance all of the smart kind of capabilities that you would find in a commercial vehicle, but it's unique because it's gone to yet another domain, in order to get that information and really enhances speed and accuracy of what's being fed to cars on the road. So unfortunately that's probably all I could say about it at this point. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time, I'll turn the call back over for any closing remarks. Steve Demetriou : Yes, thank you. Just to close out, since the pandemic started the safety and well-being of our people have been our top priority. And in parallel, we've worked hard to deliver on our client commitments. We're going to continue that focus in spite of the virus escalating around the world. Hopefully, you've got a flavor today that we continue to play a role in support of the major pharma clients in the front line of the vaccine therapeutic production and we're encouraged by the recent announcements on the vaccines. And as we close out this fiscal year, I'm proud of the performance we delivered in these unprecedented times and the credit goes to the ingenuity and dedication of all of our people. As a result, we're entering fiscal year 2021 from a position of strength in our key markets, and a collective determination to drive growth through innovative solutions for our clients. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. During this presentation, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to Slide 2 of the presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results to prior-period on a pro forma basis. See Slide 2 for more information on the calculations of these pro forma measures. Our pro forma comparisons current and prior-period excludes the results of the Woods Nuclear business which closed in March 2020 and Buffalo Group which closed in November of 2020. We provide historical pro forma results in the Appendix of the investor presentation. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we're making against our strategy and reviewing our commitments to ESG and sustainability solutions. Bob will then review our performance by line of business and Kevin will provide some more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by an update on our Focus 2023 integration efforts, as well as a review of our balance sheet to cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide a detailed, our updated outlook along with the closing remarks, and then we'll open the call for your questions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Jon, and thanks, everyone for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and strategy update. It's been about a year since the pandemic started, and we hope everyone is safe and healthy, as COVID-19 continues to impact all facets of our daily lives. At Jacobs, in addition to keeping our people safe, we're continuing to support national governments and industry and their production and distribution of critical vaccines. Turning to Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results, it's important to review our strategy which is foundational to an investment in Jacobs. We believe the transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created a compelling multi-decade investment opportunity for our current and potential shareholders based on three key tenets. First, we have transformed our culture, aligned around a common purpose of creating a connected sustainable world underpinned by strong values of we do things right. We challenge the acceptance, we aim higher, and we live inclusion [ph]. This culture permeates through our more than 50,000 people, the solutions we deliver for our clients, and the engagement in our communities where we live and work. Our purpose-driven culture has also enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in market conditions, while also staying focused on our long-term vision of being a technology-enabled solutions provider. Second, we have a portfolio of solutions aligned to a diverse set of global opportunities such as space exploration, cyber readiness, climate change, and modernizing and digitizing our infrastructure. Our thematic growth areas are global, allowing us to address them efficiently, effectively, and competitively at scale through our integrated global platform of technology, our talented resources, domain expertise, and enhanced brand awareness. Finally, our Jacobs Management team has demonstrated the ability to strategically allocate capital, including successfully executing acquisitions. Our continued focus on strategy and execution has resulted in a strong start to fiscal 2021 even while continuing to manage the headwinds from the global pandemic. First quarter net revenue increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 8%. Our backlog ended the first quarter up 11% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong momentum, we're increasing the mid-point of our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and EPS outlook. Our cash flow generation was strong during the first quarter, and our balance sheet remains healthy. In the near-term, we do expect to deploy excess cash towards paying down debt. Last quarter, we announced a strategic majority investment in PA Consulting, and we are happy to share that the transaction was overwhelmingly approved on February 4 with 99.8% of PA shareholders voted in favor of the transaction. Particularly exciting was the fact that the voluntary election for management rollover was fully subscribed and new partner hiring has also been very successful post announcement, indicating the enthusiasm and commitment of PA partners and employees about the future growth opportunity of this partnership. Confirmation of the scheme of arrangement is awaiting regulatory approval by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, and we expect to close the investment by the end of this current quarter. PA's performance for calendar 2020 exceeded our expectations, and their pipeline of strategic and technical consulting work continues to grow. This includes a new engagement with the UK's Department of International Trade, advising on project defense and UK supply chain resilience to underpin economic and national security. Along with reaching a key milestone with the National Institute for Health Research, where they completed a UK public sector first delivery of Google Cloud Search to upgrade research platforms. Once we complete the transaction, we expect significant benefit for the clients of our firms driven by the complementary solutions offering of PA and Jacobs. Now looking further into fiscal 2021 and beyond, we believe Jacobs has a compelling organic growth opportunity and as appropriate, we will further accelerate that growth through thoughtful strategic acquisitions that offer a higher return versus our alternatives of repurchasing shares of Jacobs. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to review some recent ESG actions. As a company we're committed to delivering results to all our stakeholders, our employees, our clients, our investors, and our communities. Delivering on this includes our commitment to our sustainability strategy called PlanBeyond and our Climate Action Plan launched last year. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a net zero carbon, including 100% renewable energy for our operations in 2020. And our carbon reduction targets have been formally approved by the science-based targets initiative. The climate agenda will continue to be front and center in 2021 with the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26 being held in November. In support, Jacobs announced our Pledge to Action, a campaign inviting our clients and suppliers around the globe to take measurable actions to tackle climate change before the opening of COP26, and we're also leveraging the power of our Jacobs people in making a positive impact. We launched our Climate Countdown Challenge where employees can join a new mission each month to tackle the climate crisis. Through both of these initiatives, we hope to raise awareness, inspire, and motivate individuals and companies and demonstrate the collective power of organizations taking actions now to make an impact for generations to come. Moving to Slide 6, at Jacobs, we intend to lead from the front in the transformation to a net zero economy. In combination with the COVID-19 pandemic, Climate change remains the major global driver for ecological, social, and economic disruption, impacting every person, community, business, and governments around the world. It's also a major disruptor advancing technology-enabled innovation and sustainable business models for addressing decarbonization, the global energy transition and resource scarcity. Jacobs is uniquely positioned to support our clients and communities in developing and deploying solutions and technologies across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including renewable energy and clean power, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency and energy storage, green buildings, sustainable transport, circular economy, carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as adaptation and resilience for all facets of infrastructure. This includes developing technology solutions, like our recently announced launch of Jacobs Travel Service Optimization solution, which transforms the home-to-school travel experience for special educational needs and disabilities children and young people. This solution combines our deep domain knowledge with the latest advances in data analytics to determine the most efficient ride sharing experience, while supporting decarbonization and our long-term transition to a net zero economy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. And now, moving on to Slide 7, to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high-levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workforce and clients have addressed the primary challenges of physical distancing, and continue to execute on our contracts, regardless of work location at approximately 95% of normal operating levels. Total CMS backlog is at $9.7 billion representing a 14% year-over-year growth and up 4% on a pro forma basis. The CMS strategy is focused on both revenue growth and margin expansion by aligning to our go-to-market strategy towards critical national priority of digital monetization, strategic data utilization, lower orbit satellites, hypersonics, and cyber. I'll discuss each in greater detail. Beginning with digital modernization trends, our global government clients faced the current task of transforming their digital stack of information, communications and security systems in order to maintain their national security. We were on this transformation journey with our clients as we develop and operate their next-generation digital systems. In December, we cleared the protest period on the Navy Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management Award, and we were awarded another new digital modernization project for the Army's Intelligence and Security Command. In addition to digital modernization, a second key growth driver for our business is the DOD's increased focus on strategic data utilization. The DOD is becoming a data centric organization, combining edge computing with data intelligence and analysis at hyperspeed and scale. That is considered a strategic asset similar to the priority given to weapon systems and is increasingly central to Warfighter advantage in and out of theater. As an example, our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance team was recently awarded a feat on the 10-year $950 million Ceiling IDIQ to provide various unmanned aircraft solutions and satellite payload services for the Air Force's Advanced Battlefield Management System. ABMS allows a Joint Force to use cutting edge methods and technologies to rapidly collect, analyze and share intelligence information and make decisions in real time. Moving on to low earth orbit satellites. These satellites play a key role in advanced communications, military reconnaissance, intelligence, and other imaging applications. Jacobs began a new era in advanced stage radar payloads with the successful launch of its Mango One satellite. Our approach enables government and commercial customers to proliferate space-based sensors to see in the dark and through clouds to provide near continuous monitoring, gathering valuable actionable intelligence in the ground, sea, air and space domain. And now on to Hypersonic. Hypersonic offensive and defensive weapons technology is unquestionably one of the highest priorities for government clients. Jacobs through its decades supporting the Air Force and NASA is a clear leader in hypersonic solution. During the quarter, CMS was awarded a hypersonic test cell contract from the Air Force at Arnold Engineering Development Complex to transform this facility into a unique large scale clean air variable Mach number test facility with extended runtime capability. A final trend is to discuss cyber. The recent SolarWinds Sunburst advanced persistent attack continues to make headlines giving the sophistication and dwelling time. In fact the Biden administration has requested a $9 billion plus increase in spending for cyber and modernization. And, as mentioned on our call last quarter, the British government also approved its largest military investment increase in 30 years by \u00a316.5 billion or 10% per year over the next four years in defense areas, including cybersecurity. CMS in cyber and intelligence business has grown over the past several years to more than 3,300 professionals today. Part of our growth strategy is to continue to add adjacent capabilities and customers. The Buffalo Group acquisition which closed in November, posted strong initial performance and is a catalyst for achieving immediate scale and deep client access with a strong majority of the U.S. intelligence agencies and combatant commands. In summary, we continue to see strong structural demands for our solutions. Supporting this, the CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 months qualifying new business pipelines remaining above $30 billion, including over $10 billion in-source selection and an increasing margin profile. Now on to Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Last quarter, we conveyed optimism around our balanced portfolio and our ability to remain resilient through economic and geopolitical volatility. This is demonstrated by strong P&L performance in the quarter, as well as 9% year-over-year backlog growth. After a steady pipeline in 2020, and momentum in government funding strategies, timing remains uncertain in our focused geographies, such as in the U.S. and UK. We anticipate further improvement to our pipeline as governments solidify their budget. I'll discuss four trends impacting the macroeconomic environment in our sectors, all of which we\u2019re well-positioned to capitalize on. First, climate change and decarbonization of the economy, private sustainability and resilience for public and private entity; second, economic influence for long-term job growth and economic relief; third, the pandemic and continued growth in health, life sciences and cloud computing; and fourth, modernization of infrastructure and the digitalization of the industry. Beginning with climate change and the decarbonization of the economy, the environmental sector is experiencing growth as government, the investment community, companies and citizens confirm their commitments to climate action, act on their decarbonization agenda, and increased focus on PFAS an emerging determinant. We generated the largest growth in this sector year-over-year and anticipate our investment in PA Consulting to further strengthen our decarbonization solutions offer. These solutions such as advising our clients on their climate action goals, developing strategy and policy, assisting in program implementation, and providing intelligent asset management are embedded in all our geographies and sectors. A great example of this is our recent win in Orange County, Florida, to develop innovative, resilient and sustainable waste management systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations, for cleaner electricity use. Recent awards for the Marinus Link Electricity Interconnector linking the States of Victoria and Tasmania in Australia and Project Connect one of the world's largest lithium ion batteries are key elements supporting Australia's renewable energy transition. In the Middle East, where we are the program manager to Expo 2020 Dubai, the sustainability pavilion known as Terra premieres this month. Leveraging our industry leading sustainability expertise, Terra is designed to be a net zero carbon driving full operations, and provides a glimpse of what is to come when Expo fully opens later this year. Next, we'll discuss economic stimulus spend aimed at long-term job growth and economic relief. In the U.S., the current administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda that aligns directly with the long-term growth of our markets. We have every reason to believe that focus will continue as the administration and Congress address COVID relief, climate change, environmental justice, resilience and the need to create long-term job growth and economic recovery through infrastructure modernization. As activity on these issues progress, we anticipate funding to support our clients projects at the federal state and local level, which we're uniquely positioned to support through long-term historical Framework Agreements. In the UK, we're well-positioned for stimulus and a leveling up agenda to rebalance the economy across the country and are supporting our clients with smart integrated solutions with tangible social, environmental and economic benefits for the communities they serve. In our Asia-Pacific geography, particularly in India, Singapore and Australia, we expect an infrastructure led economic revival around transportation and green recovery, largely centered on large scale renewables and energy to catalyze the economy over the coming years. Moving to the impact of the pandemic and continued growth in Health, Life Sciences in the cloud computing supply chain. COVID vaccine production is progressing to increase capacity and distribution as well as increased demand from contract manufacturing companies with an acute focus on biotechnology and we expect our investment in PA Consulting to strengthen our end-to-end delivery in the sector. Demand for cloud computing continues to drive our data center business globally. We remain agile and are diversifying our client base to adjust to market trends and semiconductor manufacturing, building on established relationships and industry-leading leadership; we're in the negotiations with several new life sciences and electronics projects. In the built environment sector, we're gaining momentum with our clients focused on the global healthcare crisis. We were selected to lead the programming initial engineering efforts for a new campus for the California -- University of California Davis Health Center as well as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Redevelopment in Australia, where investment in technology and physical infrastructure support new trends in virtual care. Finally, I'll talk about monetization of infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. Infrastructure monetization remains a priority investment across all sectors and geographies. Transportation continues with a heavy focus on highways and rail. We were awarded the Engineering Services Project for the Houston METRO Inner Katy bus rapid transit system, as well as the new Rapid Transit project in Southeast Asia that will enable the workforce to adapt public transport, representing another example of how we support our clients with solutions to improve sustainability of our cities and places. Water sector trends are steady with implementation of digital technology and a focus on the water energy nexus and resiliency. Using Replica, Jacobs proprietary digital twin platform, we developed a digital twin of the watershed for Las Virgenes Municipal Water District in California for the evaluation of water supply scenarios, while balancing water quality and operational resilience. In summary, the foundation of our P&P business remains strong, with our long-term client base and frameworks in place to move rapidly when government funding is solidified. Positioned extremely well for the near-term secular trends, we expected steady growth trajectory, with profitability improving as we continue to move higher on the value chain. I would now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Kevin Berryman : Thanks, Bob. And now turning over to Slide 9. First quarter gross revenue increased 1% year-over-year with pro forma net revenue flat, revenue for CMS increased 3% on a pro forma basis, and P&PS net revenue was down 3%. The P&PS decline was mainly attributed to slower revenue burn, although the outlook for the business remains strong with backlog up 9% year-over-year. In the near-term, we expect reported net revenue growth be flat to up slightly year-over-year, then gain additional momentum in the second half of fiscal 2021. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.1% down 110 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by two factors. A tough compare from Q1 2020 that benefited from a favorable impact from lower benefit costs carried in corporate, and a higher mix of CMS revenue which carries lower gross margins, but also has a lower G&A as a percentage of revenue. CMS gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by almost 100 basis points, as we benefited from a mix of higher margin revenues from acquisitions and new business wins. P&PS gross margins saw some modest pressure in Q1 due to a higher amount of America's program management and O&M revenue. Lower consolidated G&A as a percentage of net revenue up 170 basis points year-over-year to 13.6% more than offset the gross margin impact. As it pertains to G&A, the first quarter continue to benefit from our ability to proactively manage our cost structure. The CMS mix benefit previously stated and some focused 2023 savings from lower real estate costs, lower travel and lower COVID-related employee medical costs. As we look forward, we'll continue to be disciplined in the management of our G&A cost. GAAP operating profit was $214 million and included $22 million of restructuring transaction and other charges, the majority associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $259 million, up 10% with both lines of business posting double-digit percent increases in operating profit. As a result, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $257 million and $1.96 per share and included a benefit of $0.54 driven by mark-to-market adjustments for our Worley equity stake, a $0.47 benefit related to a mark-to-market investment in AI software provider C3.ai, $0.16 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs, a $0.17 charge related to the impairment of our AWA management investment, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.41, up 17%. Let me provide some detail on our investment in AI software provider, C3.ai. In 2010, we made a small investment in the company, which recently completed an IPO. Today, our investment represents more than 750,000 shares in the company. Due to our lockup requirements surrounding our ownership, we applied a discount to the quarter-end value of our interest in the company. Resulting in the investment valued at $85 million on our quarter-end balance sheet, at today's price, our interest represents a greater than 20 times return on our original investment. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $280 million, and was up 8% year-over-year, reaching 10.3% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 times for Q1 driven by strong book-to-bill in P&PS. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to grow the CMS pipeline, both on a pro forma and reported basis. The timing of when this robust CMS pipeline will convert into backlog is weighted more towards the second half of fiscal 2021, resulting in our projected backlog exhibiting year-over-year growth for the year. The P&PS overall sales pipeline has increased as well driven by a pro-environmental Biden administration, broader potential infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. and an improving economic outlook. The exact timing of when many of these new stimulus related opportunities will convert to bookings will become clear over the coming months and will help support backlog growth for the year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis. CMS operating profit was $110 million, up 22% and up 15% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 8.5%. Improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, such as our recent NORAD win, which is now fully ramped. We also saw some additional benefits from favorable project close-outs. As we progress through fiscal 2021, we expect low-single-digit CMS reported revenue growth as we approach the one-year anniversary of the Wood Nuclear acquisition and continue to ramp new wins. More than offsetting the revenue headwind from fully transitioning of two large lower margin projects previously discussed, which account for a nearly $600 million headwind in annual revenue in 2021. Given the strategy to capture higher value businesses, vehicles acquisitions and organic efforts we will continue to expect reported and pro forma operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year. Moving to P&PS, Q1 net revenue was down 3% year-over-year driven by a lower short-term burn rate as bookings growth remained strong and backlog was up 9% year-over-year with a 1.3 times book-to-bill. We continue to see solid revenue growth in our Americas business offset by some timing-related slowdown in our advanced facilities and Europe and Middle East businesses. P&PS operating profit was up 10% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 13.7% for the quarter, up 160 basis points year-over-year driven by disciplined management of G&A costs. Looking forward, we continue to project P&PS revenue be up low-single-digits for fiscal 2021 with improving year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. We expect operating profit margin as a percentage of net revenue to moderate from Q1 levels, but still increase from fiscal 2020, driven by strong operating profit growth. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $47 million for the quarter. While this figure was supported by strong cost discipline, we continue to expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year driven primarily by inflation in medical costs, enhanced employee benefits, and increases in discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. Now turning to Slide 11, I'd like updating you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integrations. We continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiative Focus 2023 that we believe will, one, lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; two, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process aligned for overall longer-term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred an additional $10 million charge in cash outflows of approximately $30 million related to our Focus 2023 initiatives. These investments were mainly related to improving the utilization of our physical spaces, deploying new tools and technologies for better efficiency in our business, and strategically leaning out the organization. Turning to our recent acquisition of The Buffalo Group, the company had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth; continue to expect that the acquisition will deliver $0.08 to $0.10, adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. Regarding PA Consulting, we're pleased with the preliminary results for calendar year 2020, which are tracking ahead of our expectations. We're also optimistic about their calendar year 2021 growth plan, and after this transaction closes later this quarter, we look forward to discussing our results and growth plan in more detail. We continue to expect $0.52 to $0.57 of adjusted EPS accretion from PA Consulting for fiscal 2022. And finally, when including all integration and restructuring initiatives, as well as the AWE charge but excluding PA Consulting, we now expect the total of approximately $100 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows in fiscal 2021. When including an additional non-recurring headwind associated with a payment of 2020 related UK VAT tax payment in the current quarter, we expect a total of approximately $150 million of one-time cash outflows in fiscal year 2021. We'll update these estimates to include PA Consulting after we close the transaction. Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the first quarter, we generated $96 million in reported free cash flow, a significant improvement versus the level seen in the last several Q1 periods, primarily a result of an improvement of three days in DSO versus a year-ago, other working capital benefits and less headwinds from cash restructuring. The strong Q1 cash flow included a net negative of $44 million of one-time costs associated with Focus 2020 restructuring and other items. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $837 million and a gross debt of $1.8 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley and C3ai equity. Treating the Worley and C3ai equity as cash our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.4 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During our current fiscal second quarter, we finalized a new delayed draw term loan related to our PA Consulting investment. Post PA close, we expect our balance sheet to have continued financial flexibility. However, we'll be prudent to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment over the short-term. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide number 13. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Kevin. Now, let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong start to the fiscal year, we're raising the low-end of our previous guidance ranges. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be in a range of $1.075 billion to $1.155 billion versus our previous outlooks of $1.055 billion to $1.155 billion. And we expect adjusted EPS to now be in a range of $5.30 to $6 versus our previous outlook of $5.20 to $6. It is important to note that our guidance does not include any benefit from the PA Consulting investment, which we expect to close by the end of fiscal second quarter. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, as we benefit from our Focus 2023 initiatives, as well as potential infrastructure related stimulus and a strong alignment to a diverse set of large secular growth opportunities. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open. Joseph DeNardi : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bob, you talked a little bit about the Mango launch. Can you just speak to kind of what that now allows you to do in order to maybe more effectively market and sell that capability? And then can you just update us on the pipeline of opportunities related to that technology across the government to the extent you can? Bob Pragada : Sure, Joe. So on the first, we're really excited about what Mango One brings to us. So it's a heavy payload, low earth orbit satellite, that's ours. And we invested in this, and it's now in space gathering data, it is kind of a right of entry to some of the higher-end, both intelligence agencies as well as other application platforms. And it's going to put us in a really unique position for some of the -- not only ongoing pursuits but even for offerings that come in the future. So I'd say that, the programs and projects that we've talked about Project M and all kinds of other tropical fruits that we refer to these programs by, it puts us in a very much differentiated position to further strengthen our win ratio. There's only a few that happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess my first question relates to the strong margin performance that you saw in P&PS. So I'm just wondering, how much of that is sort of project mix versus potential short-term, lower discretionary costs, how sustainable that is? And then I guess my longer-term question is while the margins in CMS are improving, there's still a big gap between CMS and P&PS, I'm just wondering over what time can the gap between the two segment margins, narrow more? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : So Steve, you want me to take that? Steve Demetriou : Yes, go ahead, Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Yes, look Jamie, thanks for the question. First thing is on the P&PS margin profile, we actually saw a good solid gross margin performance, but really the fundamental margin profile driven primarily by the very disciplined management of our G&A costs. Of course some of that has been driven already by some of the work that we did, when we announced some of the activities relative to our reduction in footprint on real estate, some of the travel reductions that we've been doing. But there's also been fairly significant actions -- proactive actions taken in terms of managing our labor costs appropriately relative to the current situation regarding the pandemic. We're closely monitoring that. And as we think about how our business starts to come back, which is fully anticipated over the course of this year, some of those costs will come back into play as it relates to the business, but that's going to be associated with higher gross profit as well. So ultimately, margin profile will continue to be robust, maybe not at the same level as Q1 but certainly well above what we would have expected to see in 2020, what we did see in 2020, so feeling very good about that opportunity. In terms of the margin profile between the two businesses, we've said that we believe actual margin profile can improve on both sides with both of the businesses. And consequently, a big focus in 2021 is starting to reduce in a more tangible way the margin profile difference between the two businesses, and we've been communicating that CMS margins should be a strong improvement this year. And I think we started to see that in the first quarter, and we would expect that to continue to play out over the balance of 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open. Josh Sullivan : Just a question on the free cash generation and congratulations on moving the needle there. Just to the comments before about kind of a mix shift moving around. I mean, is there anything we should be thinking about any turmoil in the DSOs? I mean, is there anything that we should be thinking about as far as the free cash flow profile while you do that mix shift up to kind of more high-value work? Kevin Berryman : In general, I would say that the opportunity for us to continue to drive DSO improvements from existing levels, we believe that this remains an opportunity, it's tough work as I've always said relative to the ability to continue to drive that number down. Very pleased with the work in Q4 of last year, very pleased with where we ended Q1 of fiscal 2021. And we believe that there's an opportunity to continue to drive that down and that our mix of projects won't necessarily, ultimately result in that underlying trend longer term. So, we still feel good about that, still got a lot of work to do, but we feel good about the cash flow generative nature of the portfolio going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jerry Revich : Steve, I'm wondering if you could talk about your M&A pipeline as it stands today considering the cost reduction efforts and the upcoming integration with PA Consulting. How active are you folks in terms of scouting for opportunities at this point and based on the lean work that you're doing, does that expand the opportunity set in terms of the cost reduction opportunities you might have as you look at the next set of companies in the pipeline whether it's 2021, 2022 event? Can you just flush that out for us, please. Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Great. So we are a company that is always active and making sure we're exploring all opportunities globally, and we're going to continue to do that. We have recently executed on some acquisitions with The Buffalo Group and PA Consulting most recently, and Wood Nuclear is fairly new. So, for us our top priority is to execute on those recent acquisitions and demonstrate continued success. We feel proud of what we achieved with a major one of CH2M back in 2017 and have successfully executed and exceeded expectations, and so we want to focus on that right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the next months, our primary capital deployment is going to be to pay down debt. However, when we look at the pipeline of opportunities in our strategy, there are several bolt-on opportunities even within PA Consulting. When we think about what we have initiated there coming together with PA, they've been a very successful firm in doing bolt-on acquisitions. It\u2019s helped them create value, and we want to continue to support that, and together we think that there's going to be some real interesting things that we can do in that whole consulting arena, which is higher margin and higher value business. And then of course, anything that we can do to just accelerate our digital modernization, strategic data utilization as we have done with the series of cyber acquisitions, including most recently KeyW and The Buffalo Group, and so we'll continue to be active on the government services space, and any other bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our P&PS business as well. And, the final thing I'll say is there's some geographic expansion opportunities when you looked at our mix of business, yes, it really is still majority -- the majority of our revenue comes from the U.S. and UK and then it drops down significantly from there. And so, we think there's some great geographic expansion initiatives over the coming years. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : And just trying to get a read on P&PS, given the lower revenue burn, but strong backlog. Bob, you talked about still seeing some funding in COVID-related uncertainty out there, but the trends you mentioned especially more focus on climate change, digitization, stimulus, seem to be overwhelming that uncertainty at least in backlog. So maybe you can give us more color, what was the biggest driver of backlog growth in Q1, and especially if we do see some U.S. stimulus here, is it possible to backlog growth continues at that high-single-digit rate you saw even accelerate from here? Bob Pragada : Yes. So maybe -- Andy, I'll address that first and then go back to the year-on-year performance. We do, so the short answer is, yes. The pipeline that we capitalize on in Q1, the dialogue in anticipation of stimulus continues with our clients. And so where we fit in the value chain, where we would be in the initial concept work scoping, looking at what potential optionality are around and objectives will be different structure project, I see those continuing. As well as the opportunities we're seeing were driven by the pandemic, but in the healthcare and in the data center and semiconductor manufacturing world. So I think those remain strong. As far as what we see coming out of the funding, I really -- I'm sorry, the year-on-year piece, I'd really kind of point to the sustainability of our work due to the framework and the position we have with our clients. So, yes, there has been a bit of a revenue decline, but it wasn't a drop off the cliff. And we were able to -- there was a bit of a drop in Q3 of last year and we've been able to sustain it. Remember, comparison to last year, quarter-on-quarter -- I'm sorry, year-on-year, we weren't in the pandemic. And so, I think that flatness is what we're seeing as far as the revenue piece and looking to see -- looking at product turnaround as the backlog converts. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Fisher : Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you just talk a little bit about the increase in restructuring from I think it was $80 million to $100 million plan for the year, why did it increase kind of what's the cadence from here? I think it will certainly be a milestone when restructuring generally becomes immaterial, but I'm just wondering if they do that as long as there is going to be some M&A activity should there be some ongoing restructuring? Kevin Berryman : Yes, thanks. Appreciate the question; look on the number going from the 80 till 100. That's effectively driven by the AWE item that is a non-cash charge, we highlighted that that there was a current evaluation that was occurring during our Q4 call, you might recall. And so we basically had to write-down our AWE investment that was made several years ago, so no real difference in terms of restructuring. Of course, we have not yet included any of the dynamics associated with PA; there will be some costs obviously there. And that will be further clarified after we actually have PA come on into the full of hopefully expected by the end of this quarter. So no real fundamental change at this particular point in time other than the AWE charge, non-cash charge. Operator : Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Chad Dillard : So within your greater than $30 billion project pipeline, I think there are a couple of large projects you guys talked about in the past on the weapon sustainment and ISR side. Can you give us your latest thoughts on these [ph] what timing there has been any change in competitive landscape, the positioning? And then also, can you talk about a certain level of design activity that you're seeing globally if they acquire your private P&PS business. What are you seeing accelerating growth versus maybe some stall in the recovery? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Chad, maybe I'll start. Bob Pragada : Here in Bob. Chad, I may start on the latter. Steve Demetriou : When we talk about the P&Ps business, clearly what's driving our pipeline are the things that Bob talked about initially, and that is the whole digital modernization and strategic data utilization across all of our clients and buildings, infrastructure, advanced facilities. The whole climate change arena is clearly going to be ramping up with the change in administration in the U.S., but just a global priorities that's going on there. And look when we talk about climate change, the things we're already doing in SolarWinds and now hydrogen is kicking in and the energy storage with batteries and the whole resiliency strength that we have which we've been doing for the last several years around, flooding and sea-level rise and a whole host of other things pretty fast, et cetera. And then the whole opportunity around the advanced facilities business with regard to what the pandemic is accelerated and in the life sciences business and the electronics business because on the life sciences side, there is now a pent-up demand on non-COVID activities, obviously the priority is probably vaccines and therapeutics, but oncology, diabetes, emerging cell in gene therapy and also the fact that there is more need for capacity, so there is a huge contract whole manufacturing opportunity that's now presenting itself. And then the whole healthcare side with hospitals and what's going on globally there. And then the electronics with the future of work with everything from 5G to data centers to the semiconductor, there is clearly a wave of growth in that business as well. So -- and then on top of all that is what countries are doing around the world starting with the U.S. around stimulating their economies, coming out of the pandemic. Clearly we're seeing positive momentum in the U.S. Though we expect to see something soon with this first COVID relief package, but we're anxious to see what comes out over the coming months in the whole infrastructure stimulus, which will benefit Jacobs, it's upside. This is 2022 and beyond when we talk about infrastructure stimulus out here is not dependent on it. And then from a standpoint of UK, very positive momentum in many of the other countries are also kicking in with their infrastructure initiatives, economic initiatives. So real positive momentum on the P&PS. So, Bob do you want to comment on the backlog on CMS? Bob Pragada : Yes. We are -- within the next 12 months. I think I mentioned that $10 billion is in source selection. Specifically around, I think the question was around ISR, and our tack on cyber to that. Now with The Buffalo Group and with the kind of our positioning in that space now both in cyber as well as intelligence would it be the intelligent commands or defense or in even the joint commands, the co-concept on. We are now in the majority of them with increased skill sets across multi-domain. So we see those awards coming in. They might not be as large and longer in duration, these jobs traditionally are now in the current form aren't. But we see those continue to flow in from Q3 and beyond with higher margin. Operator : Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open. Louie DiPalma : There has been a surge in investor interest for space exploration and space reconnaissance, are you able to quantify the size of Jacobs' space portfolio as it relate to NASA, the intelligence community and the Missile Defense Agency and on this note, can you review what role Jacobs is expected to play for the Artemis Moon Program? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Space is -- has been a legacy, strengthen and an important part of our revenue going back to the -- the long history we have with NASA, where we're NASA's leading solutions provider across essentially all of their sites and so that's our foundation. And then with the KeyW acquisition and some of the other initiatives that we've done both organically and bolted-on is that first of all, low-earth space intelligence that Bob just talked about that we're very excited about most of that is a very highly classified work. So that's now going to -- we believe is going to be a very high growth add-on to our whole space initiatives. So -- and then would be adjacency work that comes with our intelligence work and relationship with the space community is the whole hypersonics area that it's going to be something that is big for us starting in the sort of the consulting research development and then getting into some of the big programs there. So well over a $1 billion today and one that we expect high growth walk going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Sean Eastman : I think nice start to the year. I'm just curious, a lot of companies are talking about digital data. I'm just curious as we think about Focus 2023, what do you think Jacobs is doing better than the competition as we think about digital, and data effectively moving the company up the value chain? Bob Pragada : Well, let me start with kind of how we've gotten to where we are because Jacobs has always been a company that has been working on digital smart initiatives going back to the work that we've done with NASA and others. But when you look at the last several years, the CH2M acquisition and was the combination has really accelerated our capability, the things that CH2M brought like digital twins that we talked about and several other capabilities. And then we go into the whole strategy that we unleashed over the last several years, around the Jacobs Connected Enterprise and now taking us to a higher level in the culture that we put in. The talent attraction that we've had a very focused talent attraction on making sure that we bring in all the subject matter expertise and the digital capabilities just -- it's been impressive and really tapping into the -- some of the most innovative companies to bring some of their talent to Jacobs. And then the last two big steps have been the rebranding to really make our clients more aware, a lot of the stuff we were doing for certain clients in one part of Jacobs, mostly rest of our clients didn't really know that we have actually capability and -- and that brand initiative that we launched last year was a key step. And then PA Consulting is now going to take it to a whole new level around the end-to-end solutions that we can provide. When you look at the IP that we have, it's pretty impressive across the board, and then the technology hubs that we focus on geospatial productive analytics, cyber, Internet-of-Things, intelligent asset management. And when you put it all together, the real differentiation for Jacobs is that we have both the domain knowledge, decades of experience working on all of these things, and markets and clients and we have typically -- state-of-the-art technology skillset in bringing digital solutions. So when you put that together, we feel like we're in that unique differentiated position. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen. This one for Kevin. Wondering do you have anymore 20 baggers in that asset portfolio of yours. Appreciate to know that, but more seriously, could you remind us when PA closes, what the balance sheet metrics on net debt, cash, leverage ratios? And how you're thinking about the current ownership of Worley and C3.ai relative to your deleveraging opportunities or your cash needs going forward? Kevin Berryman : Thanks, Mike for the question. I think with a lot of the work that Steve just alluded to in our strategy over the last several years has positioned us very, very well from the balance sheet perspective to be able to execute against the PA transaction. Our actual net debt is probably in the neighborhood once we close, is probably in the area of two times. So, still quite nice in terms of our position. We still have substance of levels of cash at that particular point in time. So we have some flexibility as it relates to that. Our gross debt levels will be a little bit higher. So our idea is that we will kind of in the very short-term, we do some of that gross debt level with incremental cash generation that we're going to be seeing about. We feel like we still have a really good flexibility as it relates to how we will look to deploy capital not in -- and then necessarily in immediate term, but certainly as we progress through the next few months and into later 2021, we'll be able to have some greater levels of flexibility there. So really quite well-positioned relative to our debt structure even after the amount of fund that are going to be paid out it's appropriately -- it's approximately about $1.8 billion. So we'll be doing well, even with that in terms of our leverage factors. Relative to the other equity matters, we said that these are good strategic investments and that we'll continue to think about what that means longer term. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Feniger : Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'm just curious on your mix in the growth prospects going forward. Basically, over the next two to three years, do you feel like more of your growth is coming from P&PS, with the infrastructure, environmental, or advanced facilities or is it mostly coming from CMS? And lastly, just to be clear, do you need a big infrastructure package to pass to reach your double-digit growth objectives in 2020? Is that critical to hit that 2020 and beyond target you guys laid out? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : So you want me to go, guys, first? Bob Pragada : Yes, go ahead, Kev. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, the guidance that we've provided, it doesn't assume anything as it relates to a major infrastructure there. There certainly seems to be some incremental momentum there and our view, however, is that we will start to see an ability to start to see incremental momentum in the back half of 2021, and certainly, the sustainability comment that Bob had made is important because of the particular stimulus package that's being considered right now provides that opportunity to do so. I think if you combine it all together with Focus 2023, and our continued efforts to drive the effectiveness across the globe and with the continuation of an improving economic picture, we still think there is an ability to have great growth in 2022 and beyond. And that would be double-digit obviously. If there is a large infrastructure built, that would be augmenting some of those numbers. I think as it relates to both CMS and PPS, with P&PS, we feel good about the growth prospects of both of the business long term. Both are aligned with really strong growth trends, critical mission areas as outlined by Bob, and then of course People & Places aligned the secular long-term growth trend. So we feel pretty good about the growth algorithm that's facing us in terms of both of the businesses. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open. Dan Charney : Hey guys, this is Dan on for Gautam Khanna. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one here. Do you have the CMS book-to-bill number excluding the acquired backlog from Buffalo? Bob Pragada : Yes, it's about a little over 1.05, 1.06 to include Wood. Dan Charney : Okay. Operator : There are no further -- Bob Pragada : It's one time. It is one time, even without Wood. Steve Demetriou : Yes, and it's over 1, even without Wood. I'm sorry. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call over to Steve Demetriou for any closing comments. Steve Demetriou : All right, thank you. In conclusion, our Jacob's people drive our performance. And this year more than ever, their commitment, creativity, and perseverance was our differentiator. We've chosen to honor their spirit in our integrated Annual Report for 2020, which we launched two weeks ago. I encourage you to visit the Investor page of our website to read the report and explore some of the stories of accomplishment for our clients and our communities in furthering our strong culture. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning. We have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. During the presentation, we'll be in forward-looking statements, including with respect to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, potential government stimulus programs and our financial outlook, among others. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is included on Slide 2 regarding these and other forward-looking statements. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supplies. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic, including, for example, our operations in the Philippines. Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return. As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security. We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. Similar to last quarter, I will discuss four notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business : space exploration intelligence, all source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy. Beginning with space exploration and intelligence. From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft and the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallace Flight facility located in Virginia, and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers. We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot fire test in the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan congressional support with preliminary FY22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense based spending was up 28% in FY21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY22 as well. Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all source intelligence capability. We were awarded two exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the Defense Combating Terrorism Center, DCTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe. We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion Solutions for Information Technology Enterprise, or SITE III, IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget, redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from states are anticipated. Kevin Berryman : Thanks, Bob. And turning to Slide 9 for a quick financial review. Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn off of two lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth from a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continued headwinds in CMS from the lower margin contracts coming to an end. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by three factors. Improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher margin business, a favorable impact from lower benefit costs and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. From a line of business standpoint, CMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix.  gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in GA as a percentage of revenue as a result of an expected rebound in labor related medical costs, IT related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth. GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation given retention related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at \u00a31.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flotation of the $267 million later in my remarks. In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment, $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32% with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark to market investment in Worley and AR software provider, C3ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs; and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the P&A investment in our operating results, with the 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2 with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off two lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds and from these two contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher margin Buffalo Group business. For the second half fiscal 2021, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition are expected to offset the revenue headwinds previously discussed. Given the strategy to capture higher value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and the rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our advanced facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. Total P&PS operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. In terms of PA\u2019s performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our focused 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high growth, high margin opportunities and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long term profitability. During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period, even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again, at \u00a31.4 billion. Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included $42 million repayment of the UK VAT tax benefit from fiscal year \u201820 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a standalone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12 month basis. Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12 month period, even when including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $267 million investment consideration now characterized as P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the Worley and C3ai equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong first half performance and the benefit from the PA consulting investment, we're raising our full year guidance ranges. We now expect adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.2 billion to $1.27 billion versus our previous outlook of $1.075 billion to $1.155 billion. We expect adjusted EPS to now be in a range of $6 to $6.30 versus our previous outlook of $5.30 to $6. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, with optimism building around a major US stimulus package and significant opportunities related to climate change and digital modernization, we are positioned for strong revenue and double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator :  Your first question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Maybe one for Bob or Steve, on the infrastructure side. Wondering if you could just focus on two things, timing. How quickly do you think you see it in your numbers, maybe what you're monitoring that will inform that? And then competitively, the industry is obviously a lot more consolidated now than it was in prior cycles. Can you talk about the implications of that for your business and maybe the margin profile for over P&PS over this upcoming cycle? Steve Demetriou : So let me just start with a couple of high level comments, Joe, is that the timing is something that we expect to -- we're not going to see the final decision and what this is all about until probably later this summer, could go into early fall. And so we'll start to see momentum pick up sometime in 2022. But I think the strategic driver for us is that whether you look at the Biden proposal or even the Republican also, which was somewhat watered down and we expect it to be somewhere between the two is that it's significant growth, there's going to be a lot of opportunity for a lot of the companies out there. And I think for us being a margin focused company and seeing the evolution of what we've been doing over the last few years is the two things for us is that as there's a need for resources, we have the best global integrated capability to bring the resources to the right place and to really focus on the highest margin opportunities as that unfolds in both businesses and P&PS at CMS. Bob? Bob Pragada : Maybe the add on the competitive climate, So Joe, where we sit with regard to framework agreements that we've had, not just in the US, but stimulus is also affecting the UK and Australia and other locations around the world, are pretty ideal for where those monies would flow. So if you look at transportation frameworks, water frameworks that we've been on for several years, it's going to position us extremely well. And those are pretty secure because the money needs to flow pretty quickly. So coupled with the fact that we're on these higher end services, I think the competitive climate we stand will fair well. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Bob, maybe I could follow up in a sense that. During the 2019 Analyst Day, you listed a 4% to 6% target for P&PS, it was called something else at the time but it's similar sort of the move forward. Are you able to give us any color regarding the ballpark of organic growth Jacobs may be able to deliver above and beyond that? And then if for some reason the similar doesn't go through given all these trends that you've been talking about ESG, sustainability, advanced facilities. Is 4% to 6% the baseline you could do more than that you think going over the next couple of years? Steve Demetriou : We're not going to provide any guidance relative to 2022 at this point in time. But I think we're feeling pretty good about the developing momentum. So we certainly, as we work through it, I think it's important to note Steve's comments relative to we're not going to go after everything. We're going to go after those things that ultimately give us the best margin potential. So I think we're excited about what \u201822 can ultimately look to and certainly, I would suggest it's probably not going down. Operator : Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Really outstanding performance from PA Consulting out of the gate for you folks. I'm wondering can you talk about whether the $300 million quarterly run rate that the business was on in March. How has that momentum translated into the second quarter? And how much variability is there in that business given the length of engagements now that we're getting to know the business a bit more? Bob Pragada : Jerry, I think the client engagements and the client stickiness call it, is solid. And so yes, the size of the engagement might be different than we would have historically seen at kind of Jacobs. But the longevity with their clients really just from the technology and the value they're contributing shows the future to be really bright. So we're feeling very positive. Steve Demetriou : Just to build on the other part of your question, Jerry, is PA Consulting did a really great job on positioning themselves to win in sort of COVID solutions, and Bob talked about that and still got some runway on it. But what they're also now seeing is several of there are other markets picking up and so that bodes well as some of the COVID work starts to phase out this other work phasing in. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Josh Sullivan : Just a question on the space exploration and intelligence vertical, you highlighted in the remarks. Can you just give us some color on the commercial dynamics? You seem unique and that you're touching the very large  launch but also have exposure on the small sat side with assets like Mango that you mentioned. Are you leveraged to one end of the market or the other large or small sat? Just how should we think about Jacobs sitting into the conversation over cube sats versus some of these larger opportunities? Steve Demetriou : Well, just, again, maybe to start with the broader space for us is it's pretty wide ranging for us. As we have always been a major player with deep space exploration and NASA being a major client for ours and we're solidly positioned there around Artemis and the research and development work they're doing around hypersonics and space architecture, et cetera. And now with the KeyW acquisition, ramping up very nicely, the whole low earth orbit, ISR, Rapid Solutions. And then you go beyond there with missile defense and some of the other aspects of space, it's become a very major market for us, specifically. Bob, around the commercial sector? Bob Pragada : I think that the adjacent and knock on effects of what we're doing, not just exploration but how that feeds into intelligence is strong. If you look at the Mango One launch, the application centered around intelligence but also the application into 5G and other commercial applications is going to continue to broaden markets that we haven't had exposed to in the past. So other things that Steve said is really expanding that aperture on the applications. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : I guess two questions. My first question, sort of going back to potential infrastructure, Bill, Steve. Are there any investments that you think are required from Jacobs in order to capitalize it? Do you feel like you have the right labor for so you're in the right niches, or do you go back and sort of contemplate M&A again. So I guess that's my first question. And then my second question, I think you noted revenues from ESG are approaching $5 billion or so. Can you talk to sort of what the underlying growth trends that you're seeing in that business and how to think about the profitability of the businesses that are more ESG focused. Steve Demetriou : We couldn't be better positioned from a standpoint of the M&A activity that's behind us. Obviously, CH2M combined with Jacobs positions us to be the major player here. And by the way that we can't keep getting to remind everyone, one of the biggest acquisitions in our industry going very well. When you look at what we paid for that compared to what it's generating today, extremely attractive financially but obviously, Jamie, helps us position to be a big winner. But then you have on top of that the PA Consulting acquisition, which now provides end-to-end capability from front end consulting all the way through delivery and ultimately things like O&M, et cetera. So from a climate change extent. So as far as other M&A, we're going to continue to look at things that can move us up the food chain from a margin standpoint, possibly some geographic expansion. But as far as the US infrastructure stimulus opportunity, I think we're extremely well positioned with the organic capability we have today. And on the climate change side, when you look at the $5 billion, it's really wide ranging of what we're in. But as you look at the growth going forward, it's going to be everything from how do we help our clients adapt and mitigate. So whether it's C-level rise, or flooding, or bush fires and droughts, the whole energy transition equation moving away from fossil fuels into clean energy, and that's both working with our government and private clients, eveyone is looking to reduce their carbon footprint, that\u2019s where we come in around the whole decarbonization and eliminating or reducing greenhouse gases and then things like natural resource stewardship, which is critical across the globe. It's a global opportunity. We\u2019re positioned well as an end to end solutions provider and bringing some unique tools and innovation, because it\u2019s going to require digital transformation to achieve these type of climate change transformative expectations by our clients. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher : So at the risk of making this a broad question or maybe something that gone on your Investor Day. Could you just run through some of your key margin initiatives and where you see the most progress made and where you have the most upside potential here? I know you've got the CMS margin mix. You've got the future of awards and a few other things, maybe just kind of give us an update on the margin potential? Steve Demetriou : When you talk about margin initiatives, it's been both organic and inorganic. One of the things we're extremely proud of around our Critical Mission Solutions line of business is all the acquisitions that recent acquisitions, KeyW, Wood Nuclear, Buffalo Group, they're all performing very well, strong first half versus last first half pro forma and they're all margin accretive to our CMS line of business. And so from that standpoint, I think that's a key addition to our margin enhancement. But then it really goes back to what we were talking about earlier to our whole global integrated delivery profile to not only bring the best resources but be more efficient in certain aspects of the whole delivery model and much more around the whole business acumen, commercial acumen side now versus several years ago and really identifying where the margin opportunities are, not just going after any business for the sake of growth. Bob, what else on that front? Bob Pragada : Yes, I think it's just staying on that digital theme, Steve, and we're looking at it both externally and internally. So for example, rationalizing our internal platforms on how we transact our business is going to have derivative benefits. Kevin's talked about it before with regards to operating leverage. And then externally, if you have to point to one, it really is around the digitization of our offering. So autonomous design, machine learning, looking at the digitization of the global delivery model and then how that can provide value solutions in a more efficient way, so it's a big . Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Chad Dillard : \u2026focus on just some of the cybersecurity issue that we've -- that's materialized over the  and really we focus the need to reinforce the  infrastructure in the US. And I just want to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about deploying what's been more like  focused cybersecurity initiative to the private sector and how are you thinking about your go-to-market strategy there? Steve Demetriou : Chad, I think we missed the first part of your question. It sounds like it's around cyber, but can you just kind of reask it and you summarize it. Chad Dillard : So I just wanted to get a sense for how you're thinking about the opportunities on cybersecurities given that there's been kind of pack on the critical infrastructure here in the US over the weekend. And then you guys have had a strong heritage in the government side and just wanted to understand how you're developing opportunities on the size and what your go-to-market strategy is there? Steve Demetriou : We're actually in the middle of it right now and I can't speak too much into the details, but the events I think that you were highlighting over the weekend, we are engaged on that, too. Kind of the portal there on leveraging it in the private sector has been our strong heritage also in the private sector with the other portfolio offerings that we have. Specifically, if it's in the hydrocarbon space, we did quite a bit of environmental remediation and regulatory work in that space. Using that as the portal in order to bring in our cyber expertise, whether it\u2019d be OT or IT has been a strong initiative and we're seeing some traction there, not just in an emergency situation but also as a part of cyber hardening of these companies. And then in other private sectors that we have, whether it\u2019d be facility, specialized manufacturing. All those things that we do for the government, the road map points to our ability to leverage our longstanding private sector relationships and do the same. So you'll see more of that coming in the coming months and coming quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : I just wanted to go back to PA Consulting. I'm not sure if I'm looking at this the right way, but PA did $0.09 of accretion in the month of March. But if I take that out of the accretion update for the full year, it kind of implies they're doing $0.04 a month for the remaining six months of the fiscal year. So I'm trying to understand that. And then also whether the previous expectation of $0.52 to $0.57 of accretion on a full year basis in fiscal '22 is still a good way to think about it? Kevin Berryman : So a couple of comments, Sean. This is Kevin. So As you think about kind of the pace of their profitability over the course of their quarters, they, like us, we have four, four or five kind of months within each quarter. And the way they handle their fixed costs and how they amortize that over the months versus the amount of revenue they get in that last month their last month tends to be the strongest month in the quarter. So effectively, don't necessarily take that $0.09 and assume that all the way through. So I think that that's one thing to recognize. So if you look and take away the $0.09 and kind of go to your remaining kind of, let's call it, $0.04 a month for the remaining six months, it is basically that number. We think that, that is really strong performance consistent with what we had in our deal model. And ultimately, we're hoping given the strong start that maybe there could be some opportunity to improve on that over the balance of the year. But so far, they started strong. And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter, but some of that's going to go away over there second, third and fourth calendar quarters for their year. And they have to do a really good job on replacing that over the balance of the year. So we feel good about the guidance we've provided. And ultimately, hopefully, that pipeline will continue to translate into incremental backlog, which could result in potentially being a little bit higher. But I think we're being prudent in terms of our guidance for PA at this point in time. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Maybe for Bob, maybe to elaborate a little bit more on life science and advanced manufacturing. Certainly, the news flow and the supply chain issues with regard to the electronics industry has been front center many investors. Are we getting to a point where there's going to be a significant investment that's going to show up and run through your PM work in the next six to 12 months. And even on the Life Science side, is it more of a global opportunity, and certainly globally positioned. But we've been hearing more about US supply chain, but is there more -- you\u2019re going to be more driven globally, whether it's a vaccine side or biologics, or some of the electronics opportunities that you're working with your clients there? Bob Pragada : Michael, let me kind of unpack both sides of that. On the semiconductor side, I'm not sure if you asked about that or life sciences, it is global. It's probably more focused in on the US for us right now. When I say US, US clients as well as agent clients that are building in the US. You're even seeing it in the stimulus bill with President Biden's efforts in order to increase that capacity here on US soil as global supply chains have been kind of rejiggered. And so we do see that having a positive effect on Jacobs. I don't know if it's necessarily six months. It's probably got a longer tail on that and eased through the next 12 to 24 months, but that's a strong trend. And it's both not only on the logic side but it's also on memory chips and some of the lower end chips that you're hearing from some of the automotive issues that are going around. Online sciences, that is probably more global as it pertains to us, and that is the rebalancing of the product portfolio, all of this attention that\u2019s been placed on vaccines, specifically around the coronavirus. Great development that's happening within the oncology world. And as I said in the remarks, that's driving a real need for contract manufacturing, probably like nothing we've seen in history because of the volumes that are needed and the speed to market around these new therapies. So overall, really, really solid picture for at least the next couple of years. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : There was a few mentions on the call about increasing investments in SG&A and IT, travel and medical. I understand the investments are for the better growth outlook. When we think about your tentative guide for double digit EBITDA growth in 2022, is there any leverage on top of that top line or the initiatives around the margin? Is it really all set to really expand incrementals in 2023 and beyond? Just curious how we should think about that trade off with a better growth outlook and some inflationary pressures that'd be building as we think of the double digit and beyond for 2022 and 2023? Steve Demetriou : So a couple of comments, Michael, first one on on the margin front or the percent of revenue that SG&A represents. We're still in a good spot relative to historical numbers. So don't think of this as being something that's going to be a big challenge for us, but we do find it necessary to make these investments. I think the next comment I would make is that's what Focus 2023 is really all about to ensure that we get improved operating leverage through the process and system enhancements that we're talking about, which will allow us as the growth dynamic begins to accelerate, which we talked about, assuming it's going to happen in 2022, and that's going to be really important for two reasons, one, to get the operating leverage. But I think the other way to think about it is if we can get that growth and afford ourselves the same ability not to hire at the same level that we've had to in past growth spurts, that's going to be really, really strong for us. So there obviously is a war for talent. And to the extent that we're going to be able to supply that incremental growth with less headcount having to be added to support it that's going to be a big positive for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Brent Thielman : First off, when we're thinking about PA Consulting, I know you guys have spoken to double digit EBITDA growth and about 12% revenue prior to the deal here. But regarding the strategic partnership, how are you thinking about that going forward? Does that still feel like something comfortable or are there more opportunities now that the partnership is intact? Steve Demetriou : There's more than we intended. In fact, what we've done -- so I mean the headline is the level of engagement and the collaborative pursuits that we have is strong. And just to quantify, we kind of thought that we would be in that maybe 40 to 50 type collaborative pursuits that would have 12 to 18 month gestation period to them, that number\u2019s -- probably double that right now, and we're getting heavily engaged and we see that getting even stronger as travel restrictions come down and we're able to jointly see clients together as well. So very strong and I think it's contributing to our optimism as we look forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy Wittmann : I just wanted to clarify two things here. One on the guidance and one on the cash flow, probably both the questions for Kevin. But I guess just, Kevin, I just want to make sure we understand the new guidance correctly. I look at about 10 months of contribution of the EBITDA numbers that you previously talked about with PA, equates about $130 million. Again, regardless of seasonality, it's kind of a rough and tough number. Your guidance, the EBITDA side is up roughly that amount. Is this a way of kind of saying like, hey, the organic outlook is still good but it's largely unchanged with most of the EBITDA raise from the acquisition. And then on the EPS side, was there anything below the line that allowed you to take up the lower end of that EPS range a little bit more? Just maybe if you could talk about that. And then just on the free cash flow, if it's just worth clarifying the cash flow from operations, there was $230 million benefit in the quarter on accrued liabilities. I'm guessing that might be associated with the $267 million that's going to be a cash outflow next quarter, but I don't know. So I was wondering if you could just clarify that benefit to this quarter's cash flow from operations? Kevin Berryman : So let me go through the second one first. You're exactly right, the $267 million, is a dynamic where the total consideration was reduced by the $267 million and now that $267 million flows through the P&L ultimately in the third quarter. So effectively, that dynamic is occurring. So you're right relative to how that works. Total consideration doesn't change. We're still at the \u00a31.4 billion on sterling. So note that, I think that's important to know, Andy. Second point, in terms of the guide, no, there's -- the guide is effectively -- we took the $0.09 and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong, they got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business NPA is a book-and-burn business, so they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. So back to the base business. Yes, we had good performance in Q2 and effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide is how we\u2019re able to characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021. Operator : And your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Just wanted to ask you a follow-up on CMS in the sense that you guided revenue to flat all and I think for the second half 2021, given the higher headwind from the two new contracts. But you do have easier comparisons if I look at Q3 versus last year, the pandemic disruption. And so are you seeing any delays in that project conversion there in CMS? And then if you look at backlog growth, it looks solid in Q2. So do you see book-to-bill continue to be at or above 1 in the second half of '21? Steve Demetriou : We've talked about it for several quarters. We're exiting two low margin large contracts. The Hanford contract and the classified contract that we've spoken about before. When you exclude those two, are critical and you exclude the acquisitions, our base business is growing. I think it's somewhere in the 8% range. And then you add on top of that, obviously, the benefit of the acquisitions that are continuing to ramp up with that on a year-over-year basis more than our -- some of them weren't on our numbers. So I think that we're feeling good about everything that we've talked about with regard to the -- where we're aligned with the growth trends, even though there's a flat defense budget. The things like Space Intelligence and hypersonics, and several of the other items that we mentioned are actually growing nicely. And so there's a lot of shift in funding. Even the DoD climate change initiatives to modernize their infrastructure in the Department of Defense that's helping us. And so overall, we're very pleased with the revenue growth in Critical Mission Solutions. Operator : And there are no further questions queued up at this time. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. So as I close the call, our thoughts are with the people, our people in India, including our Jacobs colleagues, and we'll continue to support them in dealing with the current significant challenges of the pandemic. Looking to the future, we're excited about our strong performance and our solid foundation that provides Jacobs as we develop our new strategy and chart an existing future together, and an exciting future together. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you. Please go ahead. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning. And we have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call.  During the presentation, we'll be in forward-looking statements, including with respect to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, potential government stimulus programs, expected benefits of our strategic investment in PA Consulting, our financial outlook, amongst others. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement disclaimer, which is included on Slide 2 regarding these and other forward-looking statements. During this presentation, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to Slide 2 of the presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results prior periods on a pro forma basis. See Slide 2 for more information on the calculation of these pro forma metrics. For pro forma comparisons, current and prior periods include the results of the Wood Nuclear business, which closed in March of 2020 and the Buffalo Group, which closed in November of 2020 and the PA Consulting investment which closed in March 2021. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3, speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and the future ESG at Jacobs. Bob will then review our performance by line of business. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide a detailed updated outlook along with some of our closing remarks, and then we'll open the call for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation provides further ESG related information, including additional examples of our leading ESG solution. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : All right, thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year, 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4, before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy, which includes aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double digit profit growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we are developing our new corporate strategy and just completed a midpoint review of our business and competitive landscape. We look forward to sharing our new strategy along with updated, multi-year financial targets at our Investor Day later this year. Turning to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong third quarter performance with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 26%. Backlog ended the third quarter up 7% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro-forma basis. And our backlog excludes our significant Idaho National Labs remediation. Now that the award has cleared protest, when including Idaho, total Jacobs\u2019 reported third quarter backlog would be up 11% and on a proforma basis for Idaho up 6%. Total PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 36% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 23%, making it one of the fastest growing and most profitable consultancy firms. Given the strong year-to-date performance across all of Jacobs, including PA, we are again increasing our full fiscal year, 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we believe we are entering an attractive growth period for Jacobs, driven by strong global trends and infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super cycle in global supply chain investments, most notably in our semiconductors and life sciences. We are anticipating an increasing and robust sales pipeline for both fiscal year, 2022 and 2023. We are aligning our strong culture, deep, domain knowledge and investments in technology-enabled solutions to help solve our clients\u2019 challenges and to convert this pipeline into meaningful growth opportunities for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 5. At Jacobs, our company's purpose is delivering solutions for a more connected, sustainable world. And our values are, we do things right, we challenge the accepted, we aim higher and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. Building on our plan beyond 2.0 strategy, which we released externally last week, we have now launched an ESG focused, digital thought leadership publication, Reimagined Perspectives, to share with the world what our talented teams are thinking relative to high priority challenges like climate change and how they are creating and delivering innovative solutions in response. Living up to our brand promise begins with thought leadership by stimulating discussion, asking the hard questions and seeking new ways to meet challenges. The first publication is focused on resilience from a number of perspectives and throughout today's presentation, you'll see examples of our people and our solutions at action. We encourage you to follow us on social media or visit our website to learn more. Turning to Slide 6. We are seeing an acceleration across our global customer base and communities to provide solutions for their net zero carbon commitments. For example, at one of the largest U.S. consumer goods companies, we are providing consulting services to help them drive carbon neutral facilities as part of their journey to net zero emissions, an effort that may result at rethinking their entire global supply chain. And for a transportation customer in the U.S., we're helping them leverage renewable energy sources for their rail operations to enhance electric grid reliability during critical times. And in the UK we\u2019re researching how airports of the future will accommodate hydrogen aircraft. And in Germany, we're supporting Shell's goal of becoming a net zero emissions company by planning for their new sustainable campus. And moving further east, we're supporting the development of a new solar photovoltaic power plant in Malaysia. In Australia, we've been awarded another wind energy project with a confidential customer. Altogether, sustainable solutions are a high growth business for Jacobs today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers. And now with via consulting Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detailed by line of business. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7, to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the third quarter, our CMS business continued its solid performance. Total CMS backlog is at $9.6 billion representing 6% year-over-year growth. Backlog in the quarter was impacted by protests, but we expect these to clear in Q4 resulting in strong backlog growth. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. As discussed in prior quarters, we are pursuing sectors with strong, positive growth trends, including global energy transition, space-based ISR, intelligence analytics and 5G networks. I'd like to discuss several of those trends in recent related wins in greater detail. Beginning with energy transition, progressive leaders across the world are driving initiatives to cutoff CO2 emissions through investment in clean energy solutions. And Jacobs has recently realigned its North American and European nuclear practices to better deliver our global lifecycle nuclear capabilities. This includes advanced modular reactors or AMRs that can be used for electricity generation and for the \u2013 and with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. During the quarter, Jacobs was awarded the Idaho Cleanup Project that Idaho National Laboratory, as a majority partner in the Idaho Environmental Coalition. The contract value is estimated at $3.9 billion over a ten-year period and recently cleared protests. Approximately $780 million will be included in Q4 backlog. Together with the BOE, we will use Jacobs\u2019 technology-driven solutions to reduce the environmental legacy of the cold war, while delivering social value by supporting high quality jobs in the region and protecting the Snake River Plain Aquifer, a critical element of Idaho's agricultural industry. Moving on to space-based ISR, the U.S. Military predicts that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, out-think and outmaneuver bursaries across the multiple domains, land, sea, air, cyber, and increasingly space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect and process data much quicker than air ISR. And advanced satellite centers are a critical component in the effectiveness of these military small sats. Jacobs has won a two-year contract from a classified client to perform demonstration of its active electronically scanned arrays or AESA technology, similar to the technology utilized in our Mango satellite launch. A key differentiator for Jacobs in this area is the use of our commercial 5G technology in reducing the cost of space radar by up to five times less than legacy space, radar systems. This further advances Jacobs as an aerospace and defense prime, delivering value-added commercial, space-based AESAs. Now turning to a related national security trend, intelligence analytics. Intelligence data, often collected from multiple sources, are analyzed with support from AI technologies and transformed into information that generates a picture and of adversary activity, ultimately informing and driving a commander's decision-making. Jacobs\u2019 recent Buffalo Group acquisition won two attractive awards during the quarter in support of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM. The 902d Military Group CI Human Intelligence Analytical Services contract is a $234 million five-year award to provide advanced cyber and intelligence solutions for INSCOM\u2019s, counter intelligence and counter terrorism operations. This award is expected to clear protests and added to our backlog in Q4. Jacobs also won an annual extension of the U.S. Army\u2019s biometric and identity intelligence analytical support services contract. A final trend is the growth in 5G networks. Our telecom business had a strong quarter in part from the accelerating rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, DirecTV and T-Mobile as well as health systems and the U.S. Department of Defense. The increased demand is the result of clients seeking the benefits of 5G\u2019s higher bandwidth to operate in advanced environments for commercial and consumer applications, including telemedicine, augmented reality and next-generation gaming. And the DoD is also heavily in 5G technology in support of virtual mission planning and training. We're excited about the continued increase in opportunities fueling growth in our telecom business. In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with an 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection, and importantly with an increasing margin profile. Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We continue to demonstrate strong performance driven by our strategy to focus on high value sectors in key geographic regions leveraging our strong global integrated delivery platform. Third quarter backlog was up 6%, resulting in greater than a one times book-to-bill for both revenue and gross margin. The global trends of climate change, infrastructure, modernization and digitalization, as well as accelerated supply chain demands and areas driven by the pandemic are catalyzing our clients\u2019 mid- and long-term investments. As demonstrated by results, we remain well positioned to grow. These multi-year trends, align strongly with our purpose to make the world more connected and sustainable. I'd now like to provide more insight into the effect these global trends are having on our business. Starting with climate change. As a recognized leader in forward-leaning solutions, including specific ESG actions, aligned to decarbonization and energy transition, we are very well positioned to convert our growing pipeline into tangible results. On the environmental front, we continue to win strategic work with our key clients as demonstrated by our recent win to support the U.S. Air Force in their mission to protect human health and local communities, with a focus on combating emergent contaminants, including PFAS. In addition to new wins, we were recently named by Environment Analyst as the number one leader in water quality and resources. And our work on the Tyndall Air Force Base Coastal Resilience study in Florida, was recognized as a global winner at the UK Environment Agency\u2019s 2021 Flood & Coast awards. Moving to infrastructure modernization. As part of our rapid uptick in our transit and rail portfolio, we're winning major projects around the globe, such as the east-west rail program partner in the UK, a major U.S. transit authority\u2019s, metro rail platform reconstruction and the KiwiRail monitorization program in New Zealand. These important wins leverage our capability in digitally enabled solutions. We are also developing digital solutions that apply to a wide cross section of clients and sectors around the world, allowing us to use our global platform and client base to deploy solutions and creating new recurring revenue streams. One such product is Kaleidoscope launched today. Kaleidoscope is a predictive analytics application, which supports clients, and capital planning and maps that true risks, costs and vulnerabilities of interconnected infrastructure systems. Our cross-sector domain knowledge gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing innovative solutions and create stronger growth opportunities. As an example, for the healthcare sector, we are creating one of the world's first digital twins to support operational decision making based on predictive analytics and scenario forecasting. We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze historical health and location-based service data alongside real time, meteorological, traffic, and large public event data to optimize patient demand and capacity scenarios. This is a fantastic example of how Jacobs is partnering with their clients to reinvent healthcare of tomorrow.  Shifting to our advanced facility sector. We believe we are entering an unprecedented multiyear growth cycle. In our electronic sector, we are seeing a sharp rise in semiconductors in response to the global chip shortage, given the long-term demand in cloud and edge computing, data storage and smart infrastructure such as electric grids. Multiple government initiatives have been launched with a goal of supporting semiconductor manufacturing in their respective countries. As a global leader in this space, we are well positioned for strong growth with our clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing contract manufacturing capacity as a means to supplement their own production. We have secured several large programs, including the recently announced Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, new Greenfield Campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We have also secured a major contract with Nature Works to design a manufacturing facility in Thailand, dedicated to producing biopolymers from sugar resulting in products that are biodegradable and produced from sustainable resources. The design will be executed through our global delivery model, including challenge from India and the Philippines. Finally, as it relates to pandemic driven solutions, we have an exciting win that once again, combined our world-leading domain expertise in water with our digital AI capabilities for a breakthrough project in the Middle East. We're performing program management services for the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy to deliver a wastewater laboratory that will screen and detect COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to outperform expectations. New wins include recent large revenue synergy in the UK that has built excitement across our teams. Working together, PA and Jacobs win the new UK Department of Food and Rural Affairs Management Consultancy contract, a large scale strategic advisory program for business transformation and delivery. Joint research continued to be across other regions and geographies. And I look forward to sharing additional details in the coming quarters. As we looked at specific growth areas, PA continues to support the UK\u2019s government \u2013 UK government's COVID response, with their efforts now focused on vaccine deployment and test and trace activities. On a related note, PA is also seeing growth projects, both in the consumer and life sciences sectors. As disruption from the pandemic changes business for good, we're seeing increased interest in digital and online products, experience and service models. Examples include a major retailer that is revolutionizing their online offer to create new customer experiences by moving from face-to-face to a subscription model and in health and life sciences virtualizing the clinical trials process for patients through telemedicine. On the digital solutions front, PA and Unilever teamed up to create a world-leading predictive tool, COVID-19 awareness and situational intelligence or CASI, which redefines how data can be harnessed to unlock predictive insight. The team combined their expertise and consumer goods, business intelligence, data analytics, AI, machine learning, operational resilience, and global supply chains to create a live dashboard that monitors and provides real-time and predictive intelligence from a worldwide perspective. PA's product innovations for TeakOrigin and Guide Beauty were recognized by this year's prestigious iF design awards. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contribute to growth by more than offsetting the previously disclosed burn off two lower margin contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. For the fourth quarter, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up near double digits year-over-year and up slightly on a pro forma basis. This represents strong underlying growth considering our fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 at 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which will impact our 2021 fiscal fourth quarter reported growth rate by approximately eight percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.6%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven by a few factors, favorable revenue mix in both People & Places and CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year in line with our expectations to 17%. GAAP operating profit was $264 million and was mainly impacted by $15 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $315 million, up 32% with both CMS and People & Places showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA posted strong growth and operating profit during the quarter versus their year ago second. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.82 per share, and primarily included $0.44 related to an updated non-cash valuation allocation between PA Consulting preferred and common shares with no impact to the original consideration, $0.34 related to the UK statutory tax rate changes and an updated estimate of our annual adjusted effective tax rate. $0.24 of amortization of acquired intangibles, all of which were partly offset by $0.23 related to the positive mark-to-market investment in Worley and the impact of monetizing the remaining portion of our C3.ai investment. Excluding all items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 30% year-over-year. Included in the tax item noted earlier, third quarter adjusted EPS is impacted by 20% \u2013 by a 20% effective tax rate to reflect the change in our estimated adjusted annual effective tax rate to 22.5% from 23.8%. This change in estimated tax rate resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in our adjusted results during the third quarter. During the quarter, PA contributed $0.15 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.35 to $0.37 of 2021 PA accretion up from $0.32 to $0.34 in our previous quarter. As a reminder from modeling purposes, before we consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results with 35% minority interest backed out in non-controlling interest. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $321 million and was up 26% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation also includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA. Excluding PA, adjusted EBITDA growth was up 9% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was one times for Q3 with actually a little bit higher book-to-bills of 1.1 on a gross margin level. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 2% pro forma when the acquisition of the Buffalo Group is considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off two lower margin contracts, which represented $190 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract runoff at FX benefits, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million quarter of year-over-year impact from these two contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and our first quarter of fiscal 2022. CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 21% and up 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating margin was up 150 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities. For the fourth quarter, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue effectively offsetting the impact of the extra week of revenue last year. And we expect mid single digit operating profit growth as the timing of recent wins are now expected to ramp in fiscal year 2022. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q3 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in our international regions, as well as benefits from the FX. While the Americas business saw near term delays in larger projects, the positive developments regarding infrastructure stimulus over the last week is expected to result and customers beginning to leverage existing framework agreements as we enter 2022. We anticipate seeing awards associated with the stimulus beginning on our second half of next fiscal year. This developing momentum when combined with the strength of our advanced facilities business noted earlier by Bob positions us well into 2022. Total P&PS operating profit was up 8% year-over-year including [ph] the benefit from FX. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.8% for the quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year driven mainly by a gross margin benefit from a more profitable revenue mix. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $256 million in revenue and $57 million in operating profit. PA's Q3 revenue grew 36% and 20% year-over-year in local currency. Q3 operating profit margin was 22% in line with our expectations. Finally, our non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. The increase was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs, IT investments and other expenses. We expect non-allocated corporate cost to also turn slightly higher in Q4 given continued increases in the medical costs, and other investments, as we begin to position the company for the growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we turn to Slide 12, I would like to comment that our restructuring and other charges has significantly decreased. And as a result, we have not included a specific slide on this subject in this presentation. Comment quickly during the quarter, we incurred only $2 million of total net charges for Focus 2023, as well as other restructuring and integration activities. As a result, both P&L related cash outflows for these items remain in line with our outlook. And we are focused on significantly decreasing these adjustments going forward. During the third quarter, we generated $153 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. It is important to know this cash flow included the $261 million of purchase price consideration for PA treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter and a net $19 million associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items cash flow. Considering these items, underlying free cash flow was over $430 million putting us on track for greater than one time adjusted cash conversion for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we also monetized our investments C3.ai for $39 million, which is reflected in cash flow from investing activities. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash of $966 million and growth debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $2.2 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of our Worley ownership, treating the Worley position as cash our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.4 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. And finally given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% this year to $0.21 per share. Now let me turn it back over to Steve for Slide 13. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. Now let me review our total company outlook for fiscal 2021. Given our strong year-to-date performance, excellent results from our PA Consulting investment and the benefit from the lower tax rate, we're raising our full year guidance. We now expect the adjusted EBITDA outlook to be a range of $1.21 billion to $1.275 billion versus our previous outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.27 billion. We expect adjusted EPS to now be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35 per share versus our previous outlook of $6 to $6.30. Looking beyond fiscal 2021. The likelihood of U.S. infrastructure stimulus package has substantially increased over the last week, which has become a significant benefit to our Jacobs P&L in the second half of our fiscal year 2022 and beyond. With the strategic repositioning of our portfolio, we are aligned to strong secular growth trends, including global infrastructure modernization, climate change, national security, digital transformation, and global supply chain investments. As a result, we expect this to drive double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open. Joseph DeNardi : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bob, can you just talk about the Space Intel contract a little bit. I think that was a competitive process, correct me if I'm wrong. And then can you remind us what the additional opportunities are going forward with that capability? And then Kevin, can you just level set kind of what the outflows are that are being excluded from the free cash flow conversion? Thank you. Bob Pragada : Yes, Joe, good morning. On the Space Intelligence, it's really has to do with our some of the unique technologies around array technology. And we're not \u2013 I can't disclose the decline, but this is a multi-phase type project. And so we're on the front end of the development of that project. And so we see continued growth there. Just to add onto that, what we're also seeing with our SAR technology or the Synthetic Aperture Radar is the air-based component of what's coming out of our Rapid Solutions business. A couple of really nice wins confidential there again, early phases, but seeing the investment on that front. Kevin Berryman : Joe just real quickly on the adjusted free cash flow that we talked about, there's two items effectively. The most material one is the $261 million of the compensation treated numbers associated with PA that was ultimately originally part of our consideration. But because of GAAP, we had to run it through the P&L that's 261, and we have another 19 of restructuring related matters which are just timing relative to the P&L. But you also heard me talked about, which was $2 million. Those two added together, take our reported free cash flow to the $430 plus million for the quarter. Really strong and we're very pleased with it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good afternoon guys, or good morning guys. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Bob Pragada : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Steve or Bob, I know you mentioned a potential super cycle and supply chain related build-out, which is your most bullish commentary yet regarding advanced facilities life sciences, as you mentioned, I think Bob you mentioned a sharp uptake in semiconductor activity, but as your advanced facilities business actually contributing meaningfully to P&PS growth yet. I know Bob last quarter you talked to better ramping up over a longer-term period. When do you think you can start to meaningfully contribute to quarterly revenue and earnings growth? Is it imminent at this point or is it more FY 2022? Steve Demetriou : Yes, Andy. It would be FY 2022. Right now, how those programs and projects go. We start off with early concept and we call it basis of design activities, higher margin consultative type work, but to really see it flow through the P&L we'd be in subsequent phases of the project, which these are fast projects. So we're measuring in quarters not years with regards to how those would burn through the P&L. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Bob Pragada : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Steve, you indicated about the optimism was, I guess is fair relative to U.S. infrastructure opportunities. Maybe you can delve a little bit more deeply from your framework agreements with the customer base and some of the myriad of where their energy transition grid, climate change, there's a lot of numbers there. And I'm kidding, but how \u2013 what kind of leverage and potential opportunities could we see from your U.S. business on the P&PS side given what could be coming down the pike over the next several years? Steve Demetriou : Yes. Michael, thanks for that. So look, this we are building optimism obviously based on the news we're all reading and we're very highly engaged. And I do want to start with that. Our U.S. government relations team have done an outstanding job to help influence this outcome, which of course it's important for Jacobs, but it's highly important for the United States. So what we got here is a five-year authorization. That's going to provide our state local clients significant certainty, and that's huge. And it's also significant for Jacobs because we've evaluated that over 95% of this trillion dollar, $550 billion of new money of is totally aligned to our Jacobs offerings. And when you go through that, obviously highways, bridges, rapid transit is going to be a significant growth. But when you look at some of the other components like Amtrak and freight rail, which is going to quadruple and funding, drinking water and wastewater, which is going to be up two and a half times, therefore, it's more than doubling. Ports and waterways, we're industry leader, same thing. And then you then tack onto that, things like super fund and Army Corps civil works, which are right up where we're \u2013 the leader in the industry across that growing significantly. And that's pretty fast starting opportunities, the way the money will flow. And then of course, what you talked about Michael, energy transition resilience and a whole host of other things, $8 billion in hydrogen hubs, which we're right in the center of providing solutions. So just a great, great opportunity for Jacobs moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Sean Eastman : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on Focus 2023, maybe at the risk of feeling a bit thunder from the planned Analyst Day, but I think the initial perception around Focus 2023 was \u2013 it was a real estate kind of cost save type of strategy, talking to you guys through the quarter. It seems like it's much more than that. Could you just talk about how Focus 2023 is reflected in the double digit EBITDA growth outlook for fiscal 2022 and beyond maybe kind of clear up how we should think about? How it hits the model? Steve Demetriou : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sean. I'm glad to answer it because the Focus 2023 is a far reaching effort that's being executed across the entire company about transforming the way we work. So yes, real estate is certainly part of that because we're changing the way we're utilizing our real estate footprint and changing the way we work relative to that. We've talked about how we want to ensure that our footprint becomes more about collaboration, team building, training, and less about a place where you go and do hedge down work. So it clearly as part of that, but it's much more than that. And effectively what we're doing is aligning, creating a more disciplined in terms of the management of our processes, which is going to facilitate our ability to automate, create integrated process designs, which will facilitate people to spend less time. And what I will call the administering of our projects, that's a huge effort when we talk about our project teams around the world. So we think this unlocks talent and the time of that talent to really drive future innovation. Now relative to the double digit numbers, what we said, and certainly in 2022, our plan is that the bulk of the savings, what we're working on finalizing right now in 2022, we'll be reinvested back into the business by the next wave of potential opportunities that will allow us to deliver even incremental benefits in 2023 and beyond. So while it's a piece of the 2022 guide, or at least preliminary double digit number that we talked about, it's not a substantial piece of it because we're planning on reinvesting back into the business. We think our ability to continue to drive a company that is doing different types of work, becoming more digital and its ability to deliver work, all of that translates into a need to invest. And so consequently, a vast majority of the savings will be reinvested back into the business over the course of 2022. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Adam for Jerry today. I was wondering in PA Consulting, if you could just help us think about the incoming cadence of engagements there in the next several quarters? Steve Demetriou : Yes, Adam, the engagements are on the rise pipeline is growing. Kevin talked about the backlog growth. We're seeing when we talk about just concentrate on the private sector for a moment, kind of this investment in supply chain resiliency, as well as business transformation, PA is playing on both sides. And so we were seeing those engagements definitely on the rise and it's forming itself or showing itself from pipeline growth as well as booking growth. So we see that tail having a nice outlook on it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from AllianceBernstein. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Carolina on behalf of Chad. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Bob Pragada : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. As you think about double digit EBITDA growth over the medium term, can you parse out the contribution from PA Consulting revenue growth and second our margin expansion? Steve Demetriou : I think when we talk about the robust opportunity moving into 2022 and beyond, we're really talking about all three legs of the business via Consulting, CMS and P&PS. Almost from a standpoint of them directly contributing to that double-digit growth. I mean, CMS specifically, we talk about this $30 plus billion of new business pipeline. We're excited about the wide range. We \u2013 the Department of Defense for example, is shifting into our major focus on upgrading, modernizing and making, all of their systems more intelligent. And we play a center role there as because of the capabilities that we bring in some of the proven abilities in most recent projects.  Bob talked about the space cycle, the deep space exploration, as well as Space Intelligence. And then we move over to even things like 5G networks, where that is growing significantly, as we've talked about in our \u2013 during our remarks. But the cyber and intelligence business, the pipeline there is rising. I mean, when you look at the capability that we created going back to over the last seven or eight years with starting with FNS acquisition, then Blue Canopy, and most recently KeyW and The Buffalo Group. The leadership there and critical mission solution that are now really put that together to expand our offerings and be directly in the center of all of the cyber and mission intelligence. The fact that now we're up to 12 of the 18 intelligence agencies that we're working for. So very exciting opportunity that CMS is going to contribute to the other side of the P&PS and PA. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann from Baird. Your line is now open. Andy Wittmann : Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had, I guess three clarification for Kevin to make sure that I'm understanding the financial statements correctly. The first one has to do with, excuse me, the $267 million from last quarter that you had to expense for GAAP rules on the purchase consideration. It looks like net of some people retiring or quitting or whatever happened at PA that the net number here was $261 million, like you called out in your press release. So, there's a $6 million difference there. And I was wondering if that benefit showed up in which segment, was that in the PA segment, was that an SG&A? And then was that excluded or benefit to adjusted EPS as a gain in a quarter? And then secondarily I was, excuse me, noticing that there was $158 million of accounts receivable, which as far as I can tell is the best quarter you've ever had in taking down accounts receivable. So, I was just wondering, Kevin, if you could talk about whether that's just timing related or do you think there's a structural element to what you did in the quarter on the very good account receivable performance? Kevin Berryman : Yes, so, let me go through the first one quickly. The accounting and the complexity associated with PA because of not all of the equity pieces that we've been talking about, but also the backing out and non-controlling interest and all that kind of stuff. All of that, we did not take that benefit to our P&L that $6 million that you're alluding to. But maybe we can follow-up and John can provide you a little bit more detail there John. The second thing is, as it relates to [indiscernible] accounts receivable, sorry. No, we look, I think that while certainly a number of $430 million of free cash flow in a particular quarter is indicative of something that is not necessarily sustainable every single quarter. And so there could be, what I would say, some timing associated with that dynamic. It has nothing to do other than the good work that the teams are doing around the globe that we've been talking about for the last two or three years. And we've really started to see that come to fruition over the 2020 and 2021 years. So very proud of the teams. They're doing a good job. This is ultimately having something to do with some of the focus 2023 work we're doing where we're fine tuning and aligning our processes, where people are being able to, to get invoices out faster and ultimately more accurate invoices, which is facilitating our ability to collect sooner. So, while there certainly is some timing associated with it, it's good old fashioned, just doing good work, collecting sooner, and ultimately don't necessarily assume that that happens every single quarter to the extend its in. But we think these kinds of numbers will be sustainable going forward. And while there will be blips up and down, we're continuing to work hard to improve on our efficiencies and total working capital. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Two questions. First, Kevin the margins in P&PS were pretty good at 13.8%. I just wanted to know if there was anything in that number to help boost the margins, or is that just core performance? And then second on CMS what's the \u2013 as we're thinking about 2022, what's the opportunity here at some point to get those margins more in the double-digit range? And then my last question, understanding right now, you're focusing on de-leveraging, but the cashflow is pretty good and the net leverage is looking pretty good. As we look at 2022, at what point would you feel comfortable doing deals again, or do you think you have too much on your plate? And how should we be thinking about more opportunities to do deals that would like a, more of the PA consulting type acquisitions? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Bob talked about it, $30 billion. It's typically higher margin profile. And as that plays out, we'll see, given the mix of that, what the driver is to, to margin. Our objectives longer term is that our margin profile continues to grow across all of our businesses, including CMS. Probably getting into a strategic commentary that we're going to wait and hold on relative to our discussion at the end of the year and our Investor Day, but ultimately our expectation is that our margins will be able to go up in all of our businesses and certainly CMS would be included in that. So, I think that that's one thing. The second one. Bob Pragada : So let me just add the P&PS questions Jamie, that you started with. There's nothing special. I mean, it's really driven by strong value-add strategy that we've been talking about. So not for the point up there from a P&PS standpoint, other than great performance. The M&A side that you've talked about, clearly, we're very pleased with our cash flow and the approved balance sheet. We're obviously very excited about how fast of a start we're up to on the PA consulting. It's proving out what we talked about as far as high margin, high growth business, and the significant synergies with our total Jacobs platform. And so, we're going to finalize our strategic approach as part of this new strategy we're developing and we'll get clarity before the end of the year. But clearly the strategic consulting side is going to be one of the key components to unfold. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line, Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey good morning again. I just want to follow-up on PA consulting. It's obviously still early in your ownership, but maybe you could talk about how successful so far, you've been in bringing PA into markets where it has lower penetration, such as the U.S. Now successful [indiscernible] you had been so far in capturing more front-end consulting work because obviously the push toward more front-end work could be a big deal for you guys. Steve Demetriou : Yes, Andy, on the first part of the question, I would say, we exceeded expectations in the first three months of the investment on bringing PA into the U.S. And I'd probably point more to the private sector of that piece. PA traditionally and this is just to be even more specific, PA traditionally had relationships at the kind of Tier 2, Tier 3 life sciences clients. And whether it be MedTech and kind of product technology, or looking at the digitization of a component of their business, such as clinical trials, or other types of health information items, honed it in on a few a few Tier 2 or Tier 3. We've immediately been able to bring them into the Tier 1 rank and those same offerings at larger scale we're getting penetration on. So that's been \u2013 that's a big, big piece. Secondly \u2013 and we're seeing it in the numbers with regards to kind of the percentage of their bookings and where those are coming from leading to P&L growth in the out quarters. Second big piece, and this was publicly announced and I had it in the script. So, on the Fuji job, as we look at how we can continue to deliver next generation type services to go faster, quite frankly. PA is working with us on Fuji to automate our entire \u2013 our design approach. So, it's a great example of the digital skills of PA being brought into our core domain expertise and moving us up the value chain. So, really strong. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Fisher : Great, thanks. Good morning. I apologize I got on the call a little late, so if you've covered this, we can take it offline. But just curious about organic growth and the pace of growth there. I know, I think Kevin in the comments in the press release talked about being set up, or maybe it was Steve for nice structural growth from a number of initiatives over the next several years. Just curious about the timing of the acceleration that we could see here in your core, CMS and P&PS segment. Do you think we're sort of at that inflection point right now? Is it still, and these are fairly longer cycle businesses, is it still going to be something that takes place more in 2022? I know you talked about double digit EBITDA growth, how much of that is a function of accelerating revenue growth? If you could just fill in a little color there, thank you. Kevin Berryman : Yes. So, look, let me mention a few things we hadn't talked about yet with regard to in the Q&A is we talk a lot about what's going on in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. our organic growth activity is clearly ramping up, we have a strong pipeline in the UK. Similar drivers there with infrastructure, stimulus and focus on modernization, especially in the rail side and de-carbonization, and we're expanding into Europe with some new programs on the airport sector. And then when we move over to the Middle East, we're seeing a really good pipeline and organic opportunity in places like Saudi and across the region in high-speed rail and also on the defense side as well. And then similar things going on in parts of APAC and Australia, New Zealand. Solid pipeline in Australia, New Zealand across transportation. Also, the power sector there and the whole sustainable solution. So wanted to kind of start with that. When you take a step back and look at Jacobs\u2019 opportunity to grow organically, what we see is things are in different phases. Clearly what Bob talked about around electronics and life sciences, that's going to be a more rapid ramp up as we get into over the next several quarters, because of what \u2013 especially what's going on around semiconductors. When we talk about this U.S. infrastructure opportunity a bulk of it's going to be programmatic funding. And so therefore formulaic funding, I should've said. And so therefore some of our frameworks and the way the funding will flow will happen with more and sort of ramping up and some of it, even in the early parts of 2022. But as we get into some of the newer initiatives that the government is focusing on around resilience and energy transition, and some of the other digital opportunities, some of that will take a few extra quarters for that funding to flow to the various agencies. And the critical mission solution side, if you look back to our \u2013 the way Jacobs has unfolded over the last several years, it tends to come in, in certain peaks. And we're building up this great pipeline, we're very optimistic around the things that we've talked about and then the only question is does it hit next quarter or does it hit a couple quarters later? But when it comes, it's going to have a meaningful impact to our 2022 and moving into 2023 and beyond. So overall, we just continue to be very bullish on our ability to grow organically before we even think about deploying capital to on the M&A side. Okay, so I think\u2026 Operator : Speakers there are no further questions in the queue, please continue. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Okay, thanks everyone. I appreciate the questions. Stay safe, and to look forward to staying close with all of you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Jonathan Doros of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-K were filed this morning. And we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. During the presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, including the anticipated timing of the impact of the recently signed U.S. Infrastructure Bill, benefits of our strategic investments in PA Consulting and our financial outlook, among others. I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statements disclaimer, which is included on slide two regarding these and other forward-looking statements. During this presentation, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to slide two of the presentation for more information on these figures. In addition, during the presentation, we will discuss comparisons of current results to prior periods on a pro forma basis. See slide two for more information on the calculation of these pro forma measures. For pro forma comparisons current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisition and the PA Consulting investment. We are also providing pro forma net revenue comparisons, which also exclude the impact of the extra week in Q4 fiscal 2020. Turning to the agenda on slide three. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Jacobs\u2019 Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and the future of ESG at Jacobs. Bob will then review our performance by line of business. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial results, followed by an update on our Focus 2023 and M&A initiatives, as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide the detail on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we will open the call up for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we provided additional ESG-related information including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to slide four, before I review our results, I\u2019d like to share that we are in the final stages of completing our new strategy. We will be hosting an investor event the week of March 7th for a deep dive of the next phase of our Jacobs\u2019 transformation. Three key initiatives have emerged. First, we are putting in place a purpose-driven roadmap rooted in our values and strong culture to maximize our next stage of growth. Secondly, we identified and have aligned investment resources to capture three multi-decade growth opportunities, global infrastructure modernization, climate response and the digitization of industry. And third, we are taking a transformational approach to executing against these opportunities as we are unlocking the innovation engine at Jacobs, expanding our technology ecosystem, while accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth and durable cash flow generation. We look forward to illuminating the strategy at our upcoming investor event. Now turning to our financial results, I am pleased with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year performance, with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% during the quarter and 18% for the full year. Backlog ended the fourth quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 41% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth, while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins up 24%. For the full year, PA revenue surpassed $1 billion, far exceeding our deal investment model. As we look at overall Jacobs growth going forward, we now have certainty surrounding the unprecedented U.S. infrastructure funding with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act last week. And more broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address the challenges of climate change, advancement of their digitization strategies and increasing cyber threats. On top of that, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth, driven by the need for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post-pandemic life sciences priorities. Given these strong growth dynamics, we are introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Looking beyond 2022, we expect our strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025. Turning to slide five, as we reflect on climate change, it is globally accepted that humanity is at a critical juncture in our efforts to limit global warming. Jacobs and PA participated at the recent UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate our commitment to reinvent tomorrow with immediate and sustained action in the transition to a net zero economy. We stood alongside other business, financial and government leaders, as well as activists and students to make sure our voice was heard. We engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to ensure the world stays on track to meet the critical 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory, while preparing to adapt to the changes already locked in from climate change. As we move to slide six, given the nature of our business, it\u2019s clear that Jacobs\u2019 greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from a sustainable and resilient solutions that we co-create and deliver in partnership with our clients. To spearhead this effort, we have established a new Office of Global Climate Response on ESG to ensure that sustainability is woven into all of our solutions across markets and geographies. We are accelerating our established partnerships with the public and private sector to advance net zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience, natural and social capital, as well as ESG business transformation and alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Annually, we generate approximately $5 billion of ESG-related revenue and expect to grow significantly over the next several years, driven by strong capability in energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation and natural resource stewardship. Our culture is a competitive differentiator. Our people have the knowledge, curiosity and the trust of our clients to achieve our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. Moving on to slide seven, to review Critical Mission Solutions. During the fourth quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance. Total CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion, driven by our strategic new wins in cyber and intel, and nuclear and remediation. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include cyber, commercial space and 5G technology for national security. Beginning with cyber and intelligence, we are seeing several major emerging threats to national security. First, cyber attacks on mission-critical infrastructure, which are even more stealth and as destructive as a traditional attack. Second, the speed and complexity of near-peer threats, which requires real-time coordination between space and other domains as the severity of nation state sponsored attacks continues to increase. And third, the adoption of a data intensive AI-based applications are dramatically increasing the need for real-time data security and integrity. The funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY 2022, which is expected to be over $20 billion, up 10% from prior year. Additionally, we expect the spending within classified budgets to be up higher. During the quarter, we were awarded a $300 million seven-year contract with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency to modernize the NGA\u2019s ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross-domain imagery, including top secret data classification. And within the classified budget, we are awarded $170 million five-year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software applications that are leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning. We recently closed the BlackLynx acquisition, which provides software-enabled solutions for automating the collection of data at the edge and quickly gaining insights into extremely large volumes of structured and unstructured data. Our strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community, as well as our Digital Enablement Center, will provide the escape velocity for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions, resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue. We also recently announced a strategic investment and distribution agreement with HawkEye 360, which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their RF spectrum and analytics, and collection automation offering. Moving on to space, with a significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies, the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality, as well as other emerging opportunities such as acceleration of satellite-based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris. Today, we support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization, system and subsystem prototype work and test facility studies and projects. As commercial space matures, we are positioning our solutions for this emerging opportunity. During the quarter, we are notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract in Marshall Space Flight Center that also supports Artemis and SLS. The U.S. Space Force selected Jacobs for a five-year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur System, which coordinates the scheduling, training and status of U.S. Space Force aircraft. Finally, our telecom business has had a strong quarter and we see the roll out of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DirecTV, T-Mobile and Dish Network accelerating in 2022 and beyond. In addition, the new bipartisan infrastructure bill includes $2.5 billion for 5G rollout at U.S. military bases and the DoD is investing heavily in 5G technology in support of national priorities. In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in 2022. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business opportunities remaining above $30 billion, which includes $10 billion in source selection with an increasing margin profile. Now on to slide eight, I will discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We finished the year with strong financial performance with a year-over-year backlog growth of 7% and annual net revenue growth. I will discuss our results across the major themes of climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digitization. Starting with climate response, as the top ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is leading the effort to mitigate the impacts of climate emergency, advance transition to a clean energy net zero economy and rapidly respond to natural disasters. This quarter, Jacobs was awarded a multiyear contract by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center to integrate nature-based solutions that grow climate resilience across Defense Department facilities. Jacobs has recently been selected to reimagine New York\u2019s Rikers Island, taking the state through a full community revitalization with an equitable, resilient, multi-use approach incorporating our innovative social value analysis. As the first phase in a 20-year program across the entire city, Jacobs\u2019 plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state-of-the-art 1 billion gallons per day water resource recovery facility that includes a renewable energy hub. In the transportation market, our specialists have pioneered advanced charging technology that enables clients to transition to decarbonized operation, a key focus of economic stimulus packages. Our transit team continues to win contracts that support clients with assets, operational and technology shifts towards green fleets. For example, we recently won and commenced a hydrogen rail feasibility study with Caltrans, and our long-term work with Brisbane Metro continues to showcase cutting edge green transit solutions. With exponential growth forecasted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the go-to firm to support leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies globally. We have doubled our EV book of business in the past year and are forecasting continued growth. We also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial suite electrification and infrastructure solutions, including a proprietary SaaS platform. The green economy transition is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables, and our team is delivering diverse solutions for a range of clients, from our participation in the Bacton Energy Hub consortium in the U.K., to energy transmission plans for a potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with Iberdrola\u2019s Renewables Avonlie Solar Farm and the Swanbank Waste Energy Facility in Australia. Moving on to the theme of pandemic response, with ongoing impact to the supply chain, health systems and semiconductor chip shortage, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multi-year backlog across sectors with new wins in biopharma, such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility. Jacobs has successfully won several health opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Australia, as they rethink pandemic response operations. The most significant aspect of the global supply chain disruption involves semiconductor shortages. As the world\u2019s leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are poised for significant growth in the electronics sector this year and expect our electronics business to further accelerate over the next several years. In fact, Jacobs is engineering several major investments for large chip manufacturers. Projects like Intel\u2019s new Arizona Fab, which is -- which Jacobs is designing, are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024. The new fab will manufacture Intel\u2019s most advanced process technologies and represent the largest private investment in Arizona\u2019s history. Interconnected with climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digital transformation are leading to long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets. Globally we are continuing to win pioneering transportation projects across all sectors and modes. In highways, we were recently selected for transport to New South Wales along with consortium partners to undertake the $1.2 billion Warringah Freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road crossing Sydney Harbor. In ports and maritime, we won the sustainable ports design and program management for King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. And in air transportation, we were selected as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield airport and multimodal including a high-speed rail network with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers. The program is of national significance. It will become the benchmark for zero carbon delivery and be a sustainable transportation platform for Eastern Europe\u2019s future travel demand. Our longstanding relationships and existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. State Departments of Transportation and Transport for London, emphasizing our market-leading position for solving our client\u2019s most complex transportation challenges. In summary, we see continued investment across the P&PS client sectors. We are already experiencing exciting global wins in the first quarter of our new fiscal year indicating that we are well-positioned to develop and deliver unmatched value and capability to our clients as investment momentum builds from the U.S. Infrastructure Act and other economic stimulus. Turning to PA Consulting on slide nine. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to exceed expectations. Supported by an extension of consultative service to U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, PA\u2019s efforts have extended into a longer term vaccine deployment, testing trace and future pandemic-preparedness plan. Additionally, PA growth is being accentuated by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy, and next-generation patient care model. We continue to progress our synergy growth and long-term collaboration. The Jacobs PA team were recently awarded a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion to provide an end-to-end life cycle solution, incorporating critical digitized clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout. Additionally, we continue to receive Joint Strategic Consultancy Awards in the transportation sector globally. I look forward to our continued success with collaborative and integrated offerings to our customers. At COP26, PA displayed its deep ESG expertise and successfully unveiled its innovative EV battery charging technology, ChargePoint. Further, PA gained and -- PA received industry recognition for their jointly developed COVID-19 awareness and Situational Intelligence tool with Unilever. The business exceeded current expectations -- current expansion targets for the year and is well-positioned for continued out year growth. I will now turn it over to Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob, and good day to all listening on this call today. Turning to slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results followed by our fiscal year review. As we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%. Fourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%, including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places, CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50%. We will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring to market higher value solutions for our clients. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost, which burned both GAAP and our adjusted results. This charge was related to a CH2M legacy matter surrounding a previously completed product advisory arrangement. GAAP operating profit was $252 million and was mainly impacted by $46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley Stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter. During the quarter, PA\u2019s continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion net of incremental interest. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 12% year-over-year, representing 10% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3 times for Q4, positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year 2022. Now turning to a recap of our full year fiscal year 2021 on slide 11. Gross revenue increased 4% and net revenue was up 7%. Including the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year ago period, net revenue was up 3% for the full year. We continue to enhance our portfolio to higher value solutions, which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26% for the year, up 235 basis points year-over-year. We expect mid single-digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year, driven by U.S. infrastructure spending and the ramp-up of new awards in our CMS business. GAAP operating profit was $688 million and was mainly impacted by the $261 million of purchase price consideration for the PA Consulting investment and $150 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $1.188 billion, up 23% and represented 10% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.244 billion was up 18% year-over-year to 10.6% of net revenue and just above the midpoint of our increased fiscal 2021 outlook. GAAP EPS was $3.12 and was impacted by a $1.96 from the PA Consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation, $0.77 of amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.57 related to the U.K. statutory rate change and other U.K. related tax items, $0.35 of net charges related to Focus 2023 deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net positive $0.48 from the final sale of Worley and C3ai equity stakes. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $6.29, also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook. Of the $6.29 PA Consulting contributed $0.48 to that figure. Before turning to LOB performance, I would like to highlight that we are currently working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. As a result, while we are still reviewing key components of the plan, we expect the potential non-cash impairment charge ranging from $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal 2022. Our new footprint will facilitate virtual work options that leverage new technology and more collaborative workspaces in our offices. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to slide 12. Starting with CMS, Q4 2021 revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis. Let me remind you of the transitional dynamic impacting CMS revenue growth related to the transitioning off of two lower margin contracts. This represented $175 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract sign-off and adjusting for the extra week a year ago, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. In 2022 Q1, we expect to -- we continue to expect an approximate $210 million year-over-year impact from these two contract rollout -- roll-offs and this will phase out in Q2. As a result, we expected report -- we expect the reported revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, with underlying growth being much stronger. We expect the CMS growth trajectory to improve over the year, resulting in a reported mid-to-high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate. Q4 CMS operating profit was $115 million, up 7%. Operating profit margin was strong up 100 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%. For the full year, CMS operating profit was $447 million, up 20%, with 8.8% operating profit margin. The improvement for the quarter and the year in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities across the business. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the mid-8% range through fiscal 2022. Moving to People & Places, Q4 net revenue was flat year-over-year. When factoring in the impact from the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue approximately 8% year-over-year for Q4 and was up 2% for the fiscal year 2021. In Q4, total P&PS operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by the $20 million legal settlement costs I described earlier. Adding back on legal settlement costs, operating profit growth would have been up 8% in Q4. For the fiscal year, operating profit was up 5% or 8% excluding the legal settlement. In terms of PA\u2019s performance, PA contributed $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q4 revenue grew 41% and 32% year-over-year in sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24%, in line with our expectations. On a full year basis, PA Consulting grew revenue 33%, 24% in sterling, with adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and $190 million for the full year. These costs were up year-over-year and in line with our expectation. This increase, excuse me, was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs and IT investments related to our new ways of working. In fiscal 2022, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million given continued increases in medical costs and other investments. These corporate costs, as well as Focus 2023, CMS, P&PS investments will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022. In summary, these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our Q1 profitability and EPS being relatively flat versus our Q4 results, with Q2 then showing improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year. Turning to slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we generated $176 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The quarter\u2019s cash flow included $22 million of cash related to restructuring and other items, with $16 million related to a real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working. For the year, free cash flow was $633 million, which was mainly impacted by the $261 million of PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter. Regardless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income. For the whole year 2022, we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above 1 times. As a result of our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in $1.19 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to adjusted -- expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we monetized our Worley Stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. We will continue to monitor for any material dislocation in our share price given the strong long-term secular growth opportunities for our company. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I will turn it back over to Steve. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Kevin. We are introducing our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, which at the midpoint represents double-digit growth. Our adjusted earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2022 is in the range of $6.85 to $7.45. We expect a multiyear benefit from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to support our growth in the second half of fiscal 2022. As we look beyond this year, we see substantial opportunities for sustained organic growth driven by infrastructure modernization, climate response and digital transformation. We anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted EPS in fiscal 2025. At our in-person investor event in March we will further expound on our long-term strategy and financial model. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator :  And your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Steve Demetriou : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Steve, as you built the portfolio, it\u2019s clearly been a focus to bring together green businesses and because of the idiosyncratic ESG scoring unfortunately, you folks aren\u2019t getting much credit for that, ESG funds are 80% underweight Jacobs. How does that impact the way you folks view the CMS portfolio or portions of the CMS portfolio going forward? Steve Demetriou : Well, look, there are some investors that are holding back because of some of our work which is really a very small portion, probably, less than 2% of our overall revenue that is really focused around what I would call critical national security for the U.S. Government and we are reaching out to those investors to try to explain that we are not involved in things like the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or whatever is holding them back. But I really think that as people understand sort of the fact that we are probably the largest public company delivering ESG climate change solutions out there that, as they see that ramping up and get more clarity, I think, we are going to attract a lot more investors that want to be part of the ESG story. Jerry Revich : Just a clarification, is divestiture of that 2% on the table at all? How are you thinking about that within the portfolio context? Steve Demetriou : Look again, it\u2019s so small that we haven\u2019t really thought about that. But like anything else, Jerry, over the next few years, you will hear a little more about the stern strategy. We are going to continue to look at our portfolio and make sure we are aligned with all the right growth dynamics and I think we have proven that up to now we will continue to transform our portfolio in the right direction. Jerry Revich : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan of The Benchmark Company. Josh Sullivan : Hey. Good morning. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Josh Sullivan : I was curious if you could just give us some perspective just on global CapEx expectations into 2022. You guys have such a large global portfolio and touched so many different markets. From your view, what our customers generally planning for CapEx heading into 2022 as they look to move out of the pandemic? Kevin Berryman : So, look, I think, there\u2019s a couple of things that we need to point out, specifically, the customers that Bob highlighted in the -- in his comments really about our advanced facilities, clearly very, very, very strong now. And the semiconductor shortage is acute and we have many of our clients that are looking to build significant capacities over the next several years. I do think our private clients ultimately are now all thinking more robustly about spend as it relates to environmental solutions and thinking about how they can transform their footprints in a way that are facilitating our ability to become a more sustainable global economy and I think that that\u2019s clear. And then I would augment that is with our government services side exactly the same comment. So I think that CapEx is very strong in that regard. The last piece I would call out is our environmental business and energy transition business is touching the oil and gas space as well, where we are working with them to ultimately provide incremental capability sets that that will help them and then becoming a more viable, sustainable contributor to the global climate actions being taken around the globe. So I think you are right. There were wide -- we are focused across a wide swath and actually a lot of them, given the work we do are very, very strongly focused on these areas, which we think will encourage incremental CapEx longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Hi. Good morning. I guess first question the EPS target that you put out there for 2025, the $10, a support, obviously, good growth there. Kevin, can you just talk about, one, are there costs to achieve the $10 in terms of restructuring or investment? And then on the $10, can you provide some parameters sort of topline margins, do we need to utilize the balance sheet in terms of M&A or share repurchase to help achieve the $10? So, I guess, that\u2019s my first question. I will start there. Kevin Berryman : Yeah. Jamie, thanks. Thanks for that. The $10 is really an organic number that we are alluding to and really doesn\u2019t involve capital deployment in any material fashion. And so, I think, clearly, there could be potential upside to those numbers, but we are working through all of that with our strategy, which we will talk more about in March, as Steve outlined. So, some of your questions are a little premature as we are finalizing all that work for margins and whatnot. Rest assured, I think, you can pretty much assume that the margin is not going down as it relates to what we are trying to get accomplished from an overall perspective. As it relates to cost to get there, look, we think that most of the things that we are going to be able to do are going to be embedded in our normal course operational expenditures. We did -- I did highlight the fact that we are working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. Jamie Cook : Yeah. Kevin Berryman : We are expecting\u2026 Jamie Cook : Okay. Kevin Berryman : \u2026 a potential impairment of 60 to 70, maybe up to 70 in the first half, maybe even in the first quarter. And then if I think about other things, there\u2019s not going to be significant moneys on top of that, maybe 25 to 50 in 2022, and then 2023 and beyond, TBD, I would say. And so we are really thinking that we like the portfolio and other than things that would occur relative to integration of acquisitions and deal costs and those kind of things probably somewhat de minimis in terms of restructuring costs outside of those. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher : Great. Thanks. Good morning. One of the things I think the business and the stock really needs is kind of a breakout to the upside on the P&PS organic revenue growth and it seems like we started to see that this quarter. But, I think, Kevin, you said maybe 8% NSR growth, which is, I think, up from about 1.4% for the last couple of quarters. So maybe just more qualitatively to what extent are you really seeing a breakout on that P&PS growth now? So what\u2019s the organic assumption you have for the rest of fiscal 2022, because you give us some color on Q1 and what have you factored in there exactly for stimulus as part of that growth? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : So let me take it, and then, Bob, you can add any commentary\u2026 Bob Pragada : Sure. Kevin Berryman : \u2026 if you would like to. Bob Pragada : Sure. Kevin Berryman : Look, we are in this period of time in our Q1 and Q2 primarily where the numbers aren\u2019t really going to be impacted yet by the stimulus. We believe that\u2019s more a Q3 event. Maybe we get a little bit in Q2 but likely not and that is more Q3 and an acceleration into Q4 that we would expect the benefits associated with the stimulus and so we are excited about that. Having said all of that, I do believe our incremental growth going forward in Q1 and Q2 is going to be more solid than what we have been seeing over the last few quarters. And so we are starting to see some of that benefit of the advanced facilities, certainly not as much in Q1 but in Q2 and so I do think we will see some good solid growth in Q1 and Q2 on People & Places and then it will accelerate again, hopefully, into the Q3 and Q4 numbers. So we feel good about the developing momentum. I did make the comment that we are investing in front of that growth, too. So we are not going to see a lot of incremental margin associated with that because we are investing heavily. Bob Pragada : Yeah. What I\u2019d add to that, Kevin, is that. Steve that the -- what\u2019s giving us optimism around there is our bookings. If we look at just what the way we started out the year from a bookings perspective, it\u2019s been solid. What the other part of that is that we have to think about the project life cycle. So these bookings are starting off with consultative services that are on the front end of some of these programs and projects and then they go through the subsequent phases where our services will escalate. So, overall, very good leading indicators that support what Kevin is saying. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Bob Pragada : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Hi. Andy Kaplowitz : Can you give us a little more color into what\u2019s going on in CMS? I think, Kevin you said that CMS margin would stay in the mid-8% range in FY 2022, but the margin had already risen to over 9% in the last quarter, despite still significant contribution from the lower margin contract work that\u2019s flowing through. Is there something else now impacting your margin in FY 2022? And then on the revenue side, your CMS backlog up double digits seems to suggest that you can deliver the mid-to-high single-digit guidance that you have, but you need to see an acceleration of awards and/or revenue burn, what you have been -- versus what you have been recording in Q4 to get there? Kevin Berryman : So, CMS specifically, as you may recall, two years, three years, four years ago, when we did have these lower margin large contracts, we were in the 5% to 6% operating profit margin and we have now built over time that to the mid-8% number, which is great and it\u2019s consistent with our strategy. As we look about 2022 specifically, we will have ramp on some other lower margin business associated with Idaho and other nuclear remediation work. But that\u2019s not going to dampen our margin. It\u2019s just going to hold it flat for 2022, and then in 2023 and beyond, we started to see incremental margin above that as well. So it\u2019s a continuation of a long term margin play. It\u2019s just ebbs and flows when the big contracts come in, the margins associated with them. So 2022 is a little limited in terms of incremental margin and then we start to build again in 2023 and beyond. Steve Demetriou : So just for the, Operator, there\u2019s some background noise. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s your side that you are opening it up for questions. So could you double check that? Operator : Yes, sir. And your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard of Bernstein. Chad Dillard : Hi. Good morning, guys. So just wanted to dig into PPS, I think you got so many opportunities ahead, the climate change, semiconductor, infrastructure, digitization. How are you guys sizing the effects? Can you just like talk about the relative rank of the size of the opportunity and then just thinking through just where you guys stack up in terms of competitive dynamics in those specific segments? Steve Demetriou : Chad, can you repeat the front end -- the front part of that question again, it\u2019s a little broken. Chad Dillard : Yeah. Sure. So, I was just saying, in PPS, it seems again just so many different opportunities ahead from climate change, the semis, infrastructure, digitalization and I just want to understand just how you guys are sizing the effects across all those opportunities, if you can talk about the relative rank in terms of the size of opportunity and your relative competitive positioning in those? Steve Demetriou : Sure. So as far as prioritization goes, I would say that, kind of, if you were to segregate into two buckets, one around climate change and the second round all those things that are creating the supply chain disruption. Those are the ones that are coming to priority right now. I\u2019d say on the climate change piece and this is where the portfolio optimization is really helping us. We are honing in on those areas that we have a sound market leadership and long-term client relationships, and where we can deliver immediate value. And those are squarely around transportation, water resiliency and in all of the environmental impacts that are affiliated with climate change. And so those client relationships that we have had have been pretty robust for several years and are supporting those opportunities. Around advanced facilities, this is a multi-decade type of leadership approach that we have had specifically in semis, but also in life sciences that, that\u2019s been a legacy business of ours forever. And so we are seeing those opportunities again not searching for them, these are long-term client relationships that we have had and we are kind of in the capital planning for those clients. And so it\u2019s really gaining share with long-term clients that\u2019s setting the priorities. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Hi, gentlemen. So I am just looking at the 2025 target. I think that implies around 12% earnings growth CAGR over the next couple of years. Seems like at the midpoint of the fiscal 2022 guidance, you are going to outpace that? And I just wanted to reconcile that considering the way you described the cadence of fiscal 2022 earnings, it seems like the exit velocity is going to be quite strong and that we should actually see accelerating earnings growth out of fiscal 2022? So I hope that question makes sense, just wanted to talk through the mechanics there, maybe there\u2019s some conservatism, ay commentary there would be helpful? Kevin Berryman : Look, I think, what we do when we put forth our indications of what we expect our business to do, we think those are numbers that are obviously going to be able to be executed against. And so, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces, and you are right, we will hopefully exit this year with a greater velocity than what we entered clearly and so we will see how that plays out. But I think, ultimately, what\u2019s clear is that we have got to, whether it\u2019s 12% or 11% or 13% or 14%, whatever it ends up being, we are going to have a long haul of good solid margin enhancing growth in front of us. Sean Eastman : Okay. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Good morning, everybody. Maybe, Bob, you can share a little bit of your thoughts on your recent acquisitions and other opportunities in the pipeline from CMS, certainly increasing your cyber/intel higher margin business. But also on the PPS side, I know you put things out into your long-term guide on acquisitions. But how do you see that and is the company set to achieve these targets with the employees and professionals that you have and is there going to be some interesting opportunities to leverage some of that PA work as you get more collaborative to drive even further growth to serve the client base? Bob Pragada : Hi, Michael. Let me unpack that here a bit. First, on the acquisition piece, we are excited. If you look at the last two that we did within CMS about a year ago with the Buffalo Group and most recently with BlackLynx, these are right down the -- right in the bull\u2019s eye of where we are going in cyber and intelligence. Where we are bringing in, whether it be client diversification with the Buffalo Group and higher end advisory services and that has played out extremely well. If you look at some of the, we have code names for them, but some of the wins that we have had over the course of the last nine months, that has played out perfectly. And then BlackLynx is getting us into those software solutions coupled with advisory services on automation and collection of data with processing engines that are working at the edge all around security. And so we are excited about both of those and coupled with long-term advisory platforms that we have had and the agencies that we are already in, that\u2019s going to serve us extremely well. With regard to prospects in the P&PS world, I targeted more towards it\u2019s not too dissimilar than our cyber and intelligence prospects around technology. We have got a strong position with our domain knowledge for several decades within those end markets that we are talking about, coupled with now technology-enabled solutions is really what our acquisition strategy has been as accelerants to our strategy. So we are looking at the pipeline right now. It looks really good and more to follow on that front, as Steve mentioned, at the Investor Day. The employee base is something that we are acutely focused in on right now. This is where our globality really, really helps us, in that. We are in multiple locations around the world with high end talent that are delivering global talent utilized to deliver local solutions. And so, our ability to scale, you hear about some of the labor shortages that and labor topics that are -- that we are faced with in the western hemisphere, we are scaling in multiple locations for jobs that are all around the world and that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s been a big piece of ours. And then that last part with regards to PA, making a couple of collaborative opportunities. But where our -- where PA sits in, a lot of the same clients that we have in that C suite, as well as in kind of the front end of technology as our clients are developing new innovative ways of delivering the global topics, we are seeing the collaboration accelerate, and hopefully, we will have some more wins to talk about. The DEFRA win in the U.K. last quarter. This win -- can\u2019t disclose client in the biotechnology world. It\u2019s just shown that having the ability to offer expertise at this entirety of the life cycle of a project, to program or an issue is powerful and it\u2019s one that\u2019s picking up some significant momentum. So we are excited on all front. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the outstanding bids. I think you said $10 billion in source selection and just get a sense for, how -- what is sort of the phasing in terms of adjudication timeline, are you expecting a strong December quarter in terms of bookings? And just how does your -- how did the -- if you could talk to us about the continuing resolution and how that might change kind of the range of outcomes at CMS and relatedly recompete concentration over the next fiscal year, how much of the business basis up for rebid? Thank you. Steve Demetriou : Yeah. The -- look, we are pretty positive, confident that this whole continuing resolution, defense budgets, all that will play out over the next several months and get concluded. And we are expecting increase in the DoD budget and we are pretty positive about space and cyber and in the growth rates, especially in the classified work where we are significantly aligned too and hypersonic and telecom and we feel very well-positioned at places like NASA and how the budgets played out there. So really it is comes down to the whole timing question that you asked there. There has been some delay, very modest delay as the government clients are waiting just to see the outcome of this budget. And so as soon as that gets finalized, we see a few of these near-term prospects that we intended to unleash, whether that happens in December or the second quarter, I think, we are talking about sort of that kind of timing. So we are -- that\u2019s why we are very optimistic about the upward trend in CMS revenue growth as we move through 2022. Kevin Berryman : Just a follow-up on your question on rebids. There is at the end of the year a couple larger rebids that we are going to have to be thinking through. But there\u2019s really no rebid risk embedded into the 2022 year assumptions. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, just so we are not missing anything here, to follow up on Sean\u2019s question, you guys just did the high end of your EPS range in 2021 and the midpoint is 14% growth. So just conceptually, with infrastructure ramping up, the CMS incrementals really taking off in 2023. Is there anything we should be aware of big picture of why earnings growth would not accelerate, why it would step down to 2025? Is there -- as you were kind of alluding to, is it recompete risk? Is it just higher level of SG&A or where the margins are? Just kind of help us understand, I know you will flesh out more at the Investor Day. Just when we see that $10 of EPS and the earnings growth you guys are getting this year, which is backend loaded, just the bridge there, just what are the things that would hold back that earnings growth? Kevin Berryman : Well, look, we are talking 2025 here. That\u2019s four years from now. We are still in the midst of a pandemic and I think it\u2019s prudent to put some variability about what the world looks like four years from now. So I think the most powerful message about the $10 is we are putting that number out there even if economic situation is in not a good place in 2025. So, look, I think, it\u2019s prudent. Prudent to put out numbers that are appropriate and we feel like we can get after, and by the way, that\u2019s four years from now. So a lot can happen in four years. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, guys. Good morning, again. I just want to follow up on PA Consulting, because you recorded almost $0.50 of accretion in 2021. I think that\u2019s essentially double your original guide when you announced the deal. I know you probably don\u2019t want to tell us what\u2019s embedded exactly in FY 2022. We know what your original guy was there, but maybe you can give us color? And what has at PA exceeded your expectations by such a wide amount and what does that mean for Jacobs moving forward? Steve Demetriou : So that\u2019s a couple of things and maybe I will turn it over to Bob for any additional color. I think, Andy, the first thing is that, the acceleration in their growth, which is really the driver to what\u2019s been happening in 2022, a lot of it, a chunk of it is in related to that specific work Bob was alluding to on pandemic related and the work that they have been doing for the U.K. Government, really, really strong performance. Now they are -- as we look into 2022, they are going to be growing, but it\u2019s not going to be at that same rate that we have been talking about. They have got to figure out a way to recover and get new business to replace some of this business that\u2019s going to go away. So it\u2019s not a slam dunk as it relates to what\u2019s going to be happening in 2022 by any stretch. So having said all of that, what they have done in 2022 or 2021 has been extraordinarily strong, good margins and they have been executing well. And actually, the exciting thing is the collaboration between PA and People & Places and CMS is very strong and we are seeing that develop into longer term growth opportunities for maybe PA, but certainly Jacobs as well. Bob Pragada : Maybe two areas that we knew about, we probably didn\u2019t fully give credit to the depth of the two things I am about to mention. One is the applied technology ability that they have. You see consulting firms that have kind of a roadmap or a recipe or a methodology that they utilize for different challenges and then proposing solutions. PA is applied, applied technology to solve a unique issue. And so that has really paid some dividends, especially with the new work. Kevin and I talked about the U.K. work, but this is now what we are seeing in the U.S. And then the second is around the depth of relationship. The depth of relationships that PA has and where to connect in the client organization and really hone that relationship through performance has been extremely impressive and is, again, we knew about it, it\u2019s exceeded our expectation. Operator : And there are no further questions. Steve Demetriou : Okay. Thank you very much. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Rob and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs\u2019 Fiscal First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast.  Thank you. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information regarding forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons, current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including BlackLynx as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full period. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3, before turning to the agenda, I would like to share that on Friday, March 4, we will be releasing a digital deep dive of our new Jacobs strategy. We also plan to attend the Raymond James Investor Conference on March 7 in Orlando and the BofA Global Industrials Conference on March 15 in London. Now, to the agenda. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be our Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and then discuss our data solutions strategy, including the acquisition of StreetLight Data; Bob will then review our performance by line of business; and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by a review of PA Consulting\u2019s financial profile as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide detail on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solution. With that, I will now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our key strategic initiatives. As we have stated before, we are on the front end of a multiyear growth cycle for the company. This is driven by a combination of secular growth opportunities in our core sectors such as U.S. infrastructure investments, climate response, a super cycle of supply chain investments in electronics as well as being at the nexus of disruptive new technologies in domains of space, cyber and software analytics. We expect these opportunities to drive accelerated revenue growth for the balance of the year. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we envision Jacobs as a company like no other, a company that combines deep domain knowledge of operational environments with the latest advances in technology. We are excited to share a more comprehensive analysis of our strategy at our March investor event. Now, let\u2019s discuss the first quarter results. During the quarter, in People & Places Solutions, our Advanced Facilities business delivered double-digit revenue growth and over 20% growth in operating profit, driven by our work with Intel and other global microchip customers, along with growth in life sciences and the electrical vehicle market. And in the Americas, we are also seeing the beginnings of projects related to the U.S. Infrastructure Bill enter our pipeline. Within Critical Mission Solutions, we had a highly anticipated significant backlog addition from our space-based intelligence surveillance reconnaissance group called Rapid Solutions. The remainder of CMS pipeline remains strong with substantial new award opportunities expected this fiscal year. PA Consulting continued to outperform, posting another triple-double with 21% revenue growth, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% and double-digit pro forma year-over-year backlog growth. Total Jacobs\u2019 net revenue increased 6% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 11% during the quarter. In the first quarter, we experienced strong bookings. As a result, our overall backlog ended the quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 10% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong backlog growth dynamics of our business, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond 2022, we expect strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025, excluding any potential deployment of material capital toward M&A opportunities. At our investor event in early March, we will provide additional detail on how capital deployment and focused new growth opportunities can provide additional upside to this expectation. Turning to Slide 5, one of the most attractive opportunities for Jacobs is to expand our data and cyber businesses across three focus areas of specialized consulting, operational technology solutions and data analytics platforms. With a combination of strategic acquisition and key talent additions, we have built a strong business providing data and cyber solutions at scale to protect national security. Expanding beyond national security, as attempts by bad actors to cripple both public and commercial assets and facilities continues to increase we see accelerating requests for our data and cyber solutions from our critical infrastructure customers. We have developed and acquired a portfolio of high-technology solutions such as synthetic aperture radar technology and the BlackLynx edge computing platform, which we plan to further scale and commercialize. Jacobs also has numerous software-based analytics solutions across the water, transportation and environmental verticals, which is now enhanced with the acquisition of StreetLight Data, which I\u2019d now like to discuss in further detail. Moving to Slide 6, StreetLight Data is a vertical data-as-a-service analytics platform that helps customers gain insights into three high-growth areas. First is understanding mobility and last-mile supply chain analytics of all modes of vehicle and pedestrian movement as well as trip patterns both in recent and comprehensive historical data. Second is analyzing the impact of infrastructure investments, including how to plan the expansion of future communities and where and when to deploy electrical vehicle charging solutions and autonomous vehicles to enhance sustainable solutions. And third is measuring the social value impact of infrastructure investments on underserved communities and populations overall. As the U.S. prepares to embark on one of the largest infrastructure investments in history, having access to these analytics will be crucial, which is a new multibillion dollar market for Jacobs. We view the addressable market for StreetLight in three buckets : expanding market share with North American transportation-focused customer base; leveraging into other infrastructure segments such as water, environmental and the built environment; exploiting adjacent opportunities by expanding internationally and developing large disruptive use cases across multiple areas, leveraging Jacobs\u2019 portfolio of data and technology solutions, including geospatial technology and edge computing capabilities from recently acquired BlackLynx to create expanded market penetration, growth opportunities and solutions for our clients. The team at StreetLight has built the industry\u2019s leading solution, which is deployed throughout several U.S. and Canadian transportation authorities and municipalities. Specifically, StreetLight is multiple software development cycles ahead of the competition driven by its unique multimodal data analytics mode, proprietary algorithms and front-end user experience technology. We expect revenue to grow at over a 30% CAGR through 2025. A key part of our strategy is investing, aligning and integrating our data and digital capabilities to truly advance our scale and gain the financial economics of a high margin recurring revenue opportunity that further supports high value client solutions. This StreetLight acquisition is an important step in this direction. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions, during the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance with total backlog increasing 11% on a pro forma basis to $10.8 billion, driven by strategic new wins in space, cyber and intelligence. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth this year include spaceborne ISR, edge analytics and Intelligent Asset Management. Beginning with space ISR, our military leaders contend that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver our near-peer adversaries across multiple domains : land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect data much more quickly than airborne ISR, covering 35-fold the number of miles per hour. These small sats with radio frequency synthetic aperture radar provide time-critical intelligence in support of commercial and military missions. Jacobs continues to develop its advanced payload production and integration capabilities building on technologies from KeyW. With our recent successes, along with the integration of BlackLynx innovative software platforms, we have unlocked the opportunity to create a potential $0.5 billion annual recurring space ISR business longer term. Also during the quarter, Jacobs won a 36-month contract to provide state-of-the-art digital aerial imagery data that will be used to enhance precision agricultural practices in the Midwestern United States. The services will be provided using KeyW technology called GEOpod, which is a scalable, highly agile, airborne imagery system. Moving on to edge analytics, data is often utilized in challenging and unlikely places like the International Space Station, a military satellite, ships at sea, factory floors, water purification plants, traffic lights and neighborhood pharmacies. Data might traditionally reside in a data center or cloud, but many important decisions need to happen on the edge. Jacobs\u2019 recent acquisition of BlackLynx, an edge analytics leader in providing the sensors, software and analytic services, allows leaders to speed their decision-making exponentially. As edge computing proliferates across all domains, rapidly gaining actionable insights from the vast data becomes essential. We are already leveraging BlackLynx edge computing capabilities not only across CMS but also the infrastructure sectors of P&PS in 2022. Now in the area of Intelligent Asset Management, we\u2019re continuing to build on the solutions we developed with NASA centers and have now deployed at multiple U.S. Navy installations. Typically, these programs range from $250 million to $300 million over 6 to 8 years. We see a growing pipeline of opportunities that span across DoD, the intelligence community and commercial clients. The value for our clients is increased uptime and availability of the facilities at lower total life cycle costs achieved through targeted use of predictive analytics while simultaneously upskilling the workforce at these mission-critical complex installations. In summary, we see solid demand for our solutions in 2022 despite the headwinds of the continuing resolution, which will likely get extended through March. Although we are seeing some funding pushouts impacting our cyber intelligence and defense clients, there are pockets of new funding across our diverse U.S. government customer base as well as in commercial sectors like telecom, where 5G continues to advance. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline remaining at $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Now on Slide 8, I\u2019ll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We started the fiscal year with strong financial performance, resulting in 10% year-over-year backlog growth. I will discuss our results across four areas, including climate response, supply chain diversification, infrastructure data solutions and infrastructure modernization. Starting with climate response, opportunities continue to increase related to energy transition. And this has resulted in growth across our end markets and client sectors, notably for grid resiliency, green hydrogen and renewable energy generation. Most recently, Jacobs was selected as a program management partner to Pacific Gas & Electric on their multiyear electric undergrounding program, the largest of its kind in the U.S. The ambitious program will bring 10,000 miles of power lines underground to mitigate wildfires in and near high fire-threat areas to respond to California\u2019s evolving climate challenges. Jacobs will provide a global interdisciplinary team as well as advanced technology approaches that draw on more than 30 years of experience with PG&E and other large complex undergrounding programs like SuedLink in Germany. This important win also leveraged our subject matter experts in PA for yet another synergistic win together. With our recent award at the Pembrok Power Station in the UK, we are building on our portfolio of industry leadership in the area of hydrogen-based power. And we\u2019ve been successful with multiple awards related to solar and wind renewable generation projects in Wyoming and Australia. Moving to supply chain diversification, as a result of the global supply chain challenge, all sectors in our advanced facilities business are in growth mode, with semiconductors, life sciences and electric vehicles leading the field. And across these sectors, our ability to leverage our global integrated delivery platform and data-centric execution on these complex facilities is a clear market differentiator. Our solutions include significant win with an Asia chip manufacturer, expanding capacity in North America, continued support of Intel with additional facilities, including new builds in the U.S. And Jacobs was awarded the delivery of the first data center building for a major colocation client in the southwestern United States. In Health and Life Sciences, we recently won a project with Spark Therapeutics, a Roche Pharmaceuticals company, to build a gene therapy innovation center in downtown Philadelphia to research, develop and manufacture state-of-the-art products. Jacobs continues to deliver sustainable facilities across life sciences, like FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies\u2019 new large-scale cell culture facility in North Carolina, the largest of its kind in North America with the goal of 100% clean energy utilization and cutting-edge waste disposal and recycling system. This is a great example of projects that enable us to deliver on our purpose of creating a more connected sustainable world. Critical healthcare for thriving communities is central to our purpose, and our teams are working with clients to advance outcomes, including design of a mental health facility serving communities in western Sydney, recent completion of a state-of-the-art surgical center in Central Florida and a major hospital redevelopment in Southeast Asia. Moving to infrastructure data solutions, combining our recent digital acquisitions of BlackLynx and StreetLight as well as our venture investment in Microgrid Labs, we are well positioned to provide our clients with technology-enabled solutions through enhanced analytics and insights. We are also ideally positioned to deliver unparalleled value to the transportation and electric vehicle ecosystem, including an innovative in-road charging system in the Midwestern United States with ElectReon. In the UK, we are expanding our support of climate risk mitigation and multi-community resiliency for the environment agency through continued innovation of our proven proprietary digital technology, Flood Modeller. Additionally, as part of the first water breakthrough challenge, we provided technical sport to Anglian Water and United facilities, which resulted in innovation awards in the area of artificial intelligence for system operation and climate resilient solutions. Touching on the infrastructure monetization,  in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a unique greenfield opportunity where Jacobs is delivering strategic planning and consultancy services to build towards a net zero future. In the U.S., we are supporting clients on major programs and projects to align with capital funding and investment plan. We were selected for these awards based on our industry-leading implementation and long-term delivery success. Specifically, Jacobs was awarded the next phase of a major water treatment facility in North Texas, the new Tollway Ship Channel Bridge in Houston, Denver International Airport\u2019s seventh runway expansion and a critical win with our long-time customers in New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In summary, our global capability and innovative solutions have continued to differentiate Jacobs and provide confidence in the strength of our business based on early positioning with our clients and longer term global infrastructure stimulus. Turning to Slide 9, let\u2019s review our PA Consulting business. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to significantly outperform. Their unique combination of outcome-driven strategic and digital consulting means that they are able to capitalize on the world\u2019s current megatrends of agile working, climate change, human health and safety and digital transformation. As an example, their clients\u2019 focus on hybrid working is creating new opportunities for PA in organizational agility and resilience offerings in a range of sectors, including financial services and life sciences. Digital consulting remains PA\u2019s broadest technical capability, supported by increases in the last year in data science, analytics and AI. Aligned with this, PA continues to add to its technology portfolio with offerings such as Oakdoor, a data diode which provides a new level of security for highly-sensitive data even for the most sophisticated segmented networks; iPredict, a groundbreaking AI system for predicting failures in critical electricity distribution which has led to exciting new projects and opportunities for public utility providers in the United States. And in the health market, PA has partnered with U.S. based medical device start-up, Bearpac Medical, to create the Casio pump drainage system, a digital handheld single-patient use device to improve patient care and comfort. PA maintains its strong relationship with the UK government and has secured two new contracts for smart metering and electronic monitoring services. In the private sector, PA successfully completed two projects with U.S. based commercial partners. The first with Rheia LLC is to develop a new air distribution platform to overcome material shortages and system installation challenges facing the homebuilding industry. And the second with TeakOrigin a food startup to validate and launch an innovative business model to expand market opportunity. PA continues to be an exciting part of Jacobs\u2019 portfolio and is a crucial part of our new strategy as we continue to grow in the consulting and advisory space. Over to you, Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Thanks Bob. Now turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of first quarter fiscal 2022 results, gross revenue was flat year-over-year, driven by a decrease in pass-through revenue with net revenue up 6% and down 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Pro forma net revenue growth was impacted by the timing of large CMS wins and P&PS Americas customers evaluating investments from the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure bill. I\u2019ll explain these dynamics a bit further during the review of the lines of business performance. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.4%, up 430 basis points. Consistent with the last few quarters, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both P&PS, CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin to the total Jacobs\u2019 portfolio. We expect gross margin as a percentage of net revenue to remain in the 26% to 27% range for the remainder of fiscal 2022. As we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix, longer term, our gross margins will expand. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, we saw an increase in medical costs higher than our expectations, indicating some pent-up demand for medical care near the end of the annual plan period, which ends on December 31. GAAP operating profit was $177 million and was mainly impacted by a $72 million largely noncash charge associated with a strategic reduction in our real estate footprint as well as $47 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. The real estate downsize is the result of our ability to further leverage technology as we adapt to our new strategic ways of working. We are finding that our teams enjoy this flexibility, and we continue to see productivity increases in this regard. Adjusted operating profit was $308 million, up 19%, driven by PA posting strong double-digit growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year-ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was nearly 11%, up 110 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $1.03 per share and included : a $0.41 charge related to the previously mentioned downsizing of our real estate footprint; a $0.23 charge related to our amortization of acquired intangibles; $0.05 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continue to trend significantly lower; and a positive $0.16 tax benefit in the quarter, effectively lowering our expected adjusted tax rate for the year to approximately 22%. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.56. During the quarter, PA\u2019s continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion, net of incremental interest. Jacobs\u2019 consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 11% year-over-year and represented 11% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, we posted a robust book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x for Q1, driven by strength in both lines of business. The strong booking performance positions us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the remainder of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, Q1 2022 revenue was down 10% year-over-year and 12% on a pro forma basis. CMS revenue growth continued to be impacted by the contract runoff of a large, low-margin procurement contract and timing related to our transition on another large DOE contract. The combined year-over-year impact of the two contracts was approximately $220 million. When excluding the contract runoff, pro forma CMS revenue growth was up 5%, indicating a strong underlying positive growth profile. As a result, we expect CMS Q2 revenue to show solid growth, with second half 2022 revenue growth accelerating further as recent new wins and backlog begin to burn. For the full fiscal year, we expect reported revenue growth to be above 5%. While portions of our CMS portfolio are seeing some headwinds associated with unresolved continuing resolution in Washington, the diversity and strength of our balanced portfolio will more than offset that and drive solid organic growth. CMS Q1 operating profit was $111 million, up 1%. Operating profit margin was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 9.6%. The improvement for the quarter in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities across the business as well as the timing related to transition of our large DOE contracts. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the 8% to 9% range through the balance of fiscal 2022 but improve longer term as our revenue mix from higher-margin wins improves. Moving to P&PS. Q1 net revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Our Advanced Facilities business net revenue growth was up double digits year-over-year, driven by the investments in the semiconductor supply chain. We expect Advanced Facilities to further accelerate its growth throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong double-digit year-over-year growth, driven by more steady government funding and a favorable first quarter of fiscal 2021 year-over-year compare. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we expect solid mid-single-digit net revenue growth for our international business. Moving to P&PS Americas, current revenues remained soft due to the delayed approval of the Infrastructure Bill. However, we are beginning to see some projects related to the Infrastructure Bill enter into our pipeline. Our first quarter bookings and rising backlog provide us confidence that the Americas business will show a sequential growth as we work through the balance of our fiscal year 2022. P&PS Q1 operating profit was down 2% year-over-year with a 13.2% operating profit margin, driven by increased G&A expenses as we remain committed to strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term. In terms of PA\u2019s performance, PA contributed $290 million in revenue and $63 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q1 revenue grew 21% year-over-year in both U.S. dollars and pound sterling. Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22%. On the next slide, I will provide an additional overview of PA\u2019s financial profile. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $58 million, up year-over-year and slightly higher than our expectations, driven primarily by the increases in medical costs. We still expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Moving to Slide 12. We are approaching a year since we closed the 65% investment in PA Consulting, and their performance has exceeded our expectations. PA Consulting provides a unique combination of high-value strategic and digital consulting services to a diverse group of public and private clients. The exposure to these high-growth sectors is reflected in the company\u2019s ability to compound high double-digit revenue growth while maintaining operating profit margins well above 20%. Interestingly, U.S. publicly traded consultancies that have this type of financial profile are valued at more than 20x adjusted EBITDA, indicating that PA\u2019s performance profile offers upside to Jacobs\u2019 current valuation. At our upcoming investor event, we will provide further insight into PA\u2019s growth strategy. Turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, we had another outstanding quarter of cash flow generation with $302 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement, down 8 days year-over-year. And the quarter\u2019s cash flow included a $55 million cash payment for COVID-related deferred FICA tax payments. Next quarter, we expect free cash flow to be impacted by PA\u2019s cash payments associated with their year-end performance, higher cash taxes and an uptick in our DSO figures, given some discrete items that favorably impacted our Q1 results. Given our strong Q1 free cash flow performance and structural improvements in our collection processes through our Focus 2023 initiatives, we see increased conviction of achieving our 1x free cash flow conversion target. As a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3x, a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, and we recently announced an increase of 10% to $0.23 per share. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. Our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world has never been more relevant to now as advances in data analytics and edge computing power are unlocking our ability to deploy innovative technologies related to climate change, infrastructure and national security. Our proactive portfolio management to align ourselves to these long-term secular growth opportunities has provided us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios and even during the pandemic. We are now entering a stage where we are experiencing growth across all of Jacobs, and we expect accelerating top line growth throughout the rest of this fiscal year. We are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion and our adjusted EPS outlook of $6.85 to $7.45. Beyond the current fiscal year, our sales pipeline and robust end markets indicate continued strong performance. As I stated earlier, we anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted EPS at fiscal 2025, with the potential for upside driven by deploying additional investment in our growth accelerators of climate response, data and high-value consultancy. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator :  And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I guess one question, understanding \u2013 well, congrats on the win on CMS in terms of the award, the space award. But \u2013 and at what point \u2013 I know you said margins this year sort of in the 8% to 9%. At what point do you think CMS margins can start to narrow the gap? When can you start to narrow the gap between CMS and P&PS margins? And then I guess my second, just, follow-up question. Obviously, there has been a lot of news about semi CapEx from some major customers. Intel announced some pretty sizable numbers a couple of weeks ago. If you could just sort of frame the opportunity for Jacobs as it relates to that and when we could start to see that in numbers? Thanks. Kevin Berryman : So, let me take the first part, for sure, Jamie. This is Kevin. On the CMS margin profile, what we are going to be seeing in the last three quarters of this year is the ramp-up of our large Idaho nuclear contract, which is, as you know, has a slightly lower margin profile than the balance of the business. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s creating the 8% to 9% kind of figures that we talked about for the balance of the year. As we go into \u201823 and beyond, though, we really do believe that the ramp-up of the satellite work and various other items that are in backlog and/or in the pipeline, which we expect some success on, will result in us being able to start to build that margin profile up again, hopefully beyond 9% in 2023. Bob Pragada : And Jamie, on the semi side, clearly, it\u2019s a growing part of our overall portfolio. We have been in the space for over 20 years, and the customer that we have kind of been on the forefront of is in fact, Intel and proud that we could even announce that for years that we couldn\u2019t previously. So, you will start to see it in the numbers as it becomes even a bigger part of our portfolio. But I think the good news is that as Intel diversifies not only in the U.S. but outside the U.S., we are right there with them as their critical technical and engineering partner. So, that\u2019s going to be a big piece of our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Good morning everyone. On Slide 16, you folks laid out a $5 billion ESG solutions revenue business. I am wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind just fleshing out the major components. I know water is about $2 billion or so. What are the major pieces? And what\u2019s the growth cadence that you are looking for in those lines of business, \u201822-\u201923 timeframe? In other words, how back-end loaded is that growth outlook that you lay out on that slide? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : So Jerry, we are going to \u2013 this is going to be a big topic for us coming up in Investor Day investor \u2013 the whole investor event, Jerry. So, not to deflect the detailed side of your question, but I think we are going to lay all that out and it\u2019s going to be pretty exciting. It\u2019s unfolding now every quarter. I mean the wins that we talked about, Bob mentioned this first-ever Jacobs opportunity to do the first-ever inductive charging system on a public road like the Midwest is a great example. What we are now doing in the U.S. and Europe to address resiliency and renewable energy logistics with underground cables, the PMG one being the specific opportunity. Green hydrogen, we have got a huge wind program, several big, huge wind programs across the globe. These are all unfolding now and we will be ramping up that number that you quoted literally every quarter as we proceed. So, we are going to get into that detail, but it\u2019s everything from decarbonization, energy transition, resilience, mitigation, adaptation, it\u2019s \u2013 and we will be spelling out some specific growth targets during the investor week. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from The Benchmark Company. Your line is open. Josh Sullivan : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Within the rapid solutions and the space assets you are building out, can you just help us break down those verticals and what you are thinking about total addressable market here? And then relatedly, that aerial imagery data contract, I think you said on the GEOpod. Can you just expand on that opportunity and the customer set there as well? Bob Pragada : Sure. So Josh, the first part of the question is that if you look at kind of the cyber spectrum and then how it pertains to the overall ISR approach, I would kind of break it down into four main areas, on where we play and then there is the product component of it as well. So, the whole perspective around readiness, operations, insights and then new products development on creating platforms in order to even provide more security or more readiness or more insights is kind of how we look at it. And over the years, the acquisitions that we have done have now put us in a pretty premier spot of that. So, I think that, that is something that is going to continue to grow and puts us in multiple parts of that value chain in the ISR field. On the second part around GEOpod and what we are doing on the geospatial side, that really is an agricultural \u2013 there is clearly all kinds of applications as it pertains to infrastructure. The win that I was referencing is the commercial clients that looks at the whole kind of agricultural profile of, right now the U.S., but where we have these applications elsewhere too, and really helps on weather patterns and how the whole agricultural industry can be more efficient as the effects of almost the previous question, climate change, come into play. So, it\u2019s a nice kind of coordinated skill set that we have that even makes us bring that much more value for our clients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi guys. Good morning. I was wondering if you can talk about a little more about StreetLight, discuss cross-selling opportunities, how we should think about the sales cycle about this product? And how long is it when during a project life cycle do the discussions kick off? Steve Demetriou : Yes. So, let me start the answer. I think what\u2019s important about StreetLight is we have been doing business with them for the last 6 years, so we have a lot of experience with them and have proven success. They are a validated, capability trusted, especially in the DOTs, Department of Transportations here in the U.S., although they have been focused on a handful or so of these Department of Transportations directly. And now what we bring is the opportunity to unleash that because we are one of the leading players in transportation not only in the U.S. but globally. The whole opportunity with StreetLight is a multimodal capability, which is unique in the industry. So, they are accessing data from mobile devices, connected vehicles, geospatial, IoT sensors. And then they have a very unique process technology and with very strong algorithms and being able to create data and visible insights that will lead to climate change solutions and being able to move infrastructure to underserved communities and the whole host of infrastructure needs in the transportation sector. And then specifically from a Jacobs\u2019 standpoint, the big opportunity is that we see the opportunity to work this technology into other infrastructure sectors where we are industry-leading like water, environmental, building environment. We are able to co-develop new products with them, bring this internationally, especially in areas like UK, where we are a major player in transportation and other markets in Asia, etcetera. And so it\u2019s \u2013 we see a tremendous opportunity is the reason why we expect greater than 30% revenue growth in this business over the next several years per year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning guys. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Can you give us a little more color on how you expect CMS to trend over the year? I know, Kevin, you said still up over 5% for the year. I think that\u2019s just a little bit below your guide from last quarter. Is it possible to quantify the impact of the CR\u2019s uncertainty on your Q1 revenue? And have you seen any incremental interruption in Q2 from Omicron or supply chain? And do you need to display \u2013 you do need to display relatively significant acceleration in revenue to make your guidance. So, if you could just talk about your confidence in that. Kevin Berryman : Yes, Andy, we feel pretty darn confident actually. There is a couple of things that are going on. The year ago comparison starts to dramatically change because of those two contracts having fallen off the year ago comparables to a large extent. So, by default, that underlying growth that we are showing actually in Q1 of 5% is going to do nothing, but get better as it relates to the numbers. So, while the kind of the headline number was the falloff in revenue, the underlying health of the business is at that number we talked about, 5%. So, you got the ramp-up of the Idaho project, which is going to be a substantive build in Q2 and then three and four as well. And look, I think the continuing resolution is impacting the piece of the portfolio that you would expect it primarily in the areas of, let\u2019s call it, cyber intelligence communities. But that \u2013 while that\u2019s an important part of our portfolio, it\u2019s not the biggest part. And so we are seeing some slowdown there, but we also see backlog and wins just waiting to be executed against. And we see all of that being able to happen a little less in Q2, but certainly Q3 and four. So, the ramp there is certainly robust in the remainder of the year and especially in Q3 and Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess related to the P&PS segment, I know there is typically some seasonal headwinds in Q1 relative to Q4 of the prior year. I guess the organic growth seemed to be relatively steady. I am wondering, is there \u2013 how does that compare to your expectations in the quarter? And is there any evidence you can give us today that the Americas design business growth rate is actually accelerating now on a sequential basis, or is it more just poised to come and that just still needs to play out as the rest of the year develops? Bob Pragada : Yes. So Steve, I would say two things. Yes, the second part of your question first, we do see a growing pipeline in our Americas infrastructure business, and that\u2019s coming through in the bookings. And so I talked about the backlog growth for the entirety of the LOB. Our design business in the U.S., specifically around infrastructure, probably led the way on that backlog growth that we saw. So clearly, on the base business, without even the infrastructure bill, we are seeing the growth there. And then as the infrastructure bill, we are starting to see some tailwinds coming in, at least on a project basis from that, too. So, we are positive on that front. From a seasonality standpoint, I would say that it goes back to what Kevin said earlier. We saw growth. We also saw some costs come in with regards to medical costs and otherwise as well as preparation for people that we know are going to be full utilization as we progress the year. So, we like what we see. Kevin Berryman : Just to maybe add a little bit there is that you talked about sequential numbers. And we would expect that Q1 of the year is going to be the low point for the Americas business. And we will start to see sequential growth going off of those numbers through the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sean Eastman : Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to come back to the satellite payload technology award in the quarter. I believe this is one that you guys had highlighted as sizable prospects, but maybe the more important element around it was that it was a platform for margin accretive growth in CMS. Could you maybe refresh us on that dynamic? Obviously, if you could put numbers on it, that would be great. But I just wanted to check back in there and make sure we understand the significance of that win. Steve Demetriou : Look, I think this is the sort of anticipated win, and we are very limited in what we can talk about because of the classified nature. But it\u2019s got a phasing approach to it, but this was the critical phase to win. And so now the momentum is going to start to build. And well \u2013 again, we are going to provide some more information during investor week. But what we see is that the way this thing can phase over the next several years and what it\u2019s got us into now is an opportunity to create a $0.5 billion rapid solutions business. And we will provide some more details on how we see that sort of unfolding when we get to investor week. Kevin Berryman : And that starts to happen primarily in \u201823, the build on the project. So, the ramp will be likely mostly in \u201823. Steve Demetriou : As well as other client. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann from Baird. Your line is open. Andy Wittmann : Hi. Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I guess I just want to touch base with you and get your thoughts on the labor markets and your ability to find and keep talent today. Certainly, this is the forefront of many people\u2019s minds. And I wanted to understand how you are dealing with that today, what you are seeing in that marketplace, and if there is any net effect on the margin performance this year that you can discern from the rapidly changing inflationary labor market? Bob Pragada : Yes, Andy, it is a tough market. And \u2013 but we \u2013 I think the cultural priorities that we have been focused in on over the 5 years-plus is really starting to \u2013 well, it has been paying dividends, but it\u2019s continuing to be on the forefront. So, yes, there is challenges. Our attrition levels are remaining actually pretty steady. And we are confident that we will continue to be able to grow despite those labor challenges. The other part I would say is that this is where the globality of our business really, really makes a difference, because we are able to source talent and expertise from our global platforms to deliver solutions locally. And that has really been accentuated and magnified during this period of some labor dynamics. So, we do feel like we are really well positioned for it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Michael Dudas : Good morning everybody. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Michael Dudas : So for Steve, the \u2013 you announced StreetLight this quarter, BlackLynx last quarter. I am sure you will elaborate more on the Investor Day, but maybe the thought on how \u2013 what type of \u2013 again, where you are looking, the size that we have been seeing in the last couple of acquisitions, that\u2019s something that investors may look to see going forward unless something sizable occurs, and relative to the balance sheet that you have now and certainly adjusting from your prior acquisitions, the comfort level you have to lever that up that\u2019s all required. Steve Demetriou : Look, just to put a perspective on that question because it really is important of what you brought up is that we have been involved as a company over the last 5 years to 10 years in the NASA intelligence arena on big data and digital transformation, intelligent assets. And so now taking that platform and with the acquisitions of KeyW, Buffalo Group, BlackLynx and StreetLight over the last 3 years or so. And then add on top of that, our new venture capital strategy of seed investments and partnerships with the likes of Hawkeye 360 and Microgrid Labs. And then a big data partnership ecosystem that we have developed and putting that all together, we are now poised and positioned with a large-scale capability for transformative data solutions across all of our Jacobs\u2019 domains. And that is a strategy we are going to continue to build on. In addition to climate, which we have talked about earlier in this call, this whole data solutions is going to be a big part of what we are going to talk about in the investor week and touch on the rest of your questions as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is open. Louie DiPalma : Steve, Kevin and Bob, good morning. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Louie DiPalma : You are productizing infrastructure data solutions with StreetLight and BlackLynx. How does cyber fit into your infrastructure data solutions strategy? And for context, in December, U.S. Cyber Command created a cross-functional group dedicated to defending U.S. critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. And you obviously have elite cyber talent in your critical infrastructure division from your acquisitions of KeyW and Buffalo Group. So, can you discuss \u2013 I know you will probably discuss more at the Analyst Day about how you can layer in cyber solutions into your People & Places Solutions division services portfolio? Bob Pragada : Yes. Lou, you must have some superhuman powers on looking at what our deck looks like for the Investor Day, but the answer is yes. And it really gets exciting when you look at \u2013 these are algorithms that either index, filter or identify areas of risk in any type of data and data sets. And so the application of what we have to the infrastructure world is a natural transition. And we have already been working on that now. That, coupled with partnerships that we have in the marketplace, there is not an infrastructure project right now with major agencies, both in the U.S. and the UK, across the world in Australia, where we don\u2019t have a cyber component that\u2019s with it. So, we are in process of doing that right now for our clients, and that\u2019s going to become a bigger part of our business as we continue to go forward. But you appropriately said, it\u2019s a great skill set as cyber threats become as big of any threat that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Feniger : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I recognize you guys are touching and playing in many verticals right now and moving up the tech curve. The comment that peers are trading at 20x EBITDA or at least the PA consulting ones, when I think of capital allocation here for you guys, is it favoring M&A to build out that capability so you guys are more in that bucket and that basket, or do you feel you are already in that basket right now, your multiple is at a discount and maybe buying back shares to close that discount is more appealing? I guess just trying to evaluate if there is going to be more expensive acquisitions on the forefront to build out the capabilities and get to that peer group, or if you feel your capabilities are already checking the boxes and those are the right peers. Thank you. Steve Demetriou : I think we believe it\u2019s a combination because I do think what you commented on, what we have acquired and built both organically and with previous M&A, we feel like we are a large-scale player now. And so therefore, our \u2013 when we wake up every day, our priority is organic growth off of that platform. Secondly, any acquisition we do going forward is going to be rigorously compared to the alternative of buying back stock. And we have done that in the past. We will continue to do it. What may have looked like a pretty bold price on some previous acquisitions are now looking amazingly attractive in short periods of time. And PA is a great example, if you just \u2013 in less than a year, the whole multiple profile of our acquisition is amazingly attractive. I will just leave it like that. So, I think it\u2019s going to be a combination of going forward, that we will continue to invest in Jacobs and look at our stock buybacks. But from time-to-time, we are going to continue to build out this capability that we are really excited about. And \u2013 but it has to be a situation where we believe over the course of the first few years, we will all look back and say it was a very attractive price and not overpaying for something just because we got to get bigger. And that\u2019s \u2013 I think we have proven that in the past and we will continue to do that as we go forward. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Demetriou, I would turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks. Steve Demetriou : Okay. Thank you everyone. We look forward to hopefully having a good engagement during investor week with many of you. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs\u2019 Fiscal Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speaker\u2019s remark, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Doros. Please go ahead. Jonathan Doros : Thank you, Savannah. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information regarding forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons, the current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including StreetLight Data and BlackLynx as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full period. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be our Jacobs\u2019 Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and then discuss the launch of our Climate Action Plan; Bob will then review our performance by line of business; and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide some details on our updated outlook, along with some closing remarks, and then we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Throughout the presentation and in the appendix of this presentation, we provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I\u2019ll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, John. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and an update on our newly launched strategy. In March, we shared the details of our new strategy boldly moving forward, which unleashes a culture of inclusion, innovation and inspiration across Jacobs, enabling us to execute against one of the most exciting periods in our company\u2019s history. Our excitement surrounding the new strategy is driven by multiple robust growth opportunities across all lines of business, with additional opportunities to accelerate our performance in the areas of Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions. For those that are new to Jacobs, we are a professional services company that combines deep technical knowledge across a variety of scientific engineering and technology disciplines with cutting edge proprietary solutions. We serve a diverse set of sectors and global clients that are navigating the need to modernize their infrastructure and supply chains to protect national security, while embarking upon multiyear digital transformations across all facets of their operational environments. This dynamic creates a compelling opportunity for decades of growth for Jacobs. By staying true to our values and purpose, we are a company like no other, reinventing the way we solve problems and shaping the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients. During the quarter, net revenue grew 10% year-over-year with growth across each line of business. Bookings were strong across the company resulting in our revenue backlog up 9% year-over-year with an approving gross profit profile. We were awarded a record level of higher margin professional services and People & Places Solutions, including several strategic wins developing grants that will enable our clients to access funds from the U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act as well as an increasing number of larger opportunities entering our sales pipeline. Critical Mission Solutions benefited from the large space intelligence win, we disclosed last quarter, and PA Consulting had another outstanding quarter with 15% reported year-over-year revenue growth and 19% growth in constant currency, while delivering adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our Advanced Facilities business continues to achieve record year-over-year growth rates driven by wins in the semiconductor, life sciences, and electric vehicle sectors. Given our increased visibility and confidence for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook with no change to the midpoint. Looking beyond 2022, we continue to expect strong organic growth with healthy cash flow conversion that affords us the ability to deploy capital for enhanced value creation. Turning to Slide 5. As we outlined during our new strategy launch, we are a purpose-led company with deep domain knowledge and a track record of delivering solutions to combat the global climate crisis. With this sense of urgency top of mind, we have made significant achievements both internally and externally. With approximately $6 billion in revenue driven from ESG and climate-related solutions, we are playing a pivotal role in mitigating one of our generation\u2019s greatest threats. Working with our clients, we are co-creating solutions and energy transition, decarbonization, adaptation, resilience, natural resource, stewardship and ESG business transformation. Similarly, we have delivered on our corporate commitments through our significant emissions reductions and carbon neutrality status. And in April, we took another major step and launched our updated Climate Action Plan to align our net zero commitments with the new recognized international standard. Our ambitious commitments include ensuring every client project we undertake becomes a client response opportunity, achieving net zero emissions across our value chain by 2040 and maintaining carbon neutrality with 100% low carbon electricity for our operations. I\u2019m also proud to share that we are one of the world\u2019s first companies in the first consultancy organization to have validated net zero targets approved by our Science Based Targets Initiative. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review Critical Mission Solutions. The CMS business continued to strong backlog performance in the second quarter increasing 8% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. This strategy is underpinned by our focus on key capabilities tied to our growth accelerators, data and cyber solutions, Climate Response, and Consulting & Advisory across our core customer market of national security, space and energy. Three market trends that we are seeing offering continued strong growth this year and beyond include all-source intelligence, energy transition, and space exploration. Beginning with all-source intelligence, the increasing intelligence threat levels require analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial, and measurement and signature to allow for better real time decision making. All-source intelligence offerings are advancing to include specialized collection management, visualization, and dissemination as a service aligned to specific threats like drug trafficking, organized crime and threat finance. Jacobs\u2019 cyber and intelligence business has a full spectrum of all-source intelligence solution to guide our national security clients through these increasingly sophisticated digital threats. In the second quarter, Jacobs won the U.S. Army\u2019s intelligence operations support contract to provide comprehensive 24/7 all-source intelligence analysis to the Army\u2019s Joint Task Force, Combatant Commands, and Service Component Commands. Also, we were awarded a seat  on the DoDs and Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Data Readiness for AI development, which encompasses all tasks required to prepare, manage and secure dataset in DoD AI models and assist DevSecOps. Moving on to energy transition. Nuclear energy, along with renewables are critical components of the global energy portfolio to transition economies away from fossil fuels. There is now a growing recognition that to achieve net zero we must include the always on emission free generation that only nuclear power can provide. Every year, nuclear power averts  a gigaton of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 217 million cars. Power generated from nuclear provides stability and resilience to electrical grids, due to its unique ability to ensure 24/7 energy supply, regardless of weather conditions, and Jacobs is well positioned as a leader in delivering global nuclear solutions. We were recently awarded a contract by EDF Energy operator of the Sizewell B nuclear plant, located in Suffolk, UK, to support the extension of the station\u2019s operating life by 20 years to 2055. Another aspect of our nuclear science expertise is our strong remediation capabilities. Our environmental team has successfully faced in the Idaho cleanup project at the Idaho National Laboratory and won the Oak Ridge Reservation Contract to perform environmental remediation work for the Department of Energy in Eastern Tennessee. Finally, demand for space exploration. In past , Jacobs supported NASA and rolling out the fully integrated Space Launch System for the Artemis 1 mission with launch to occur this summer. Artemis 1 will be the first uncrewed flight mission in NASA\u2019s Deep Space Human Exploration Program. The Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon by 2025, including the first woman and first person of color. Also for NASA, we were recently awarded the NASA Ames test operations and maintenance contracts. The 5th consecutive victory for Jacobs on this contract, which we originally won in 1998, this 5-year $220 million win will book in Q3, but highlights the continuing and strong NASA-Jacobs partnership. This quarter, Jacobs was also awarded a contract from Australia\u2019s Department of Defense Space Command to support the implementation of new space capabilities in Deep Space Advanced Radar, Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance and Space Control. In summary, we continue to see solid demand for our solutions in the second half of 2022 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 month qualified new business add more than $25 billion, including $15 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Now on to Slide 8 are discussed our People & Places Solutions business. Our strategy is being actualized in real time with strong quarter backlog performance at 9% growth, while building sales momentum across multiple markets and geographies, specifically, in our advanced manufacturing, health and life sciences and U.S. infrastructure markets. I will discuss the P&P results under the themes of supply chain diversification, climate response, data solutions, and infrastructure modernization. Starting with supply chain diversification, we continue to respond to increasing demand and supply chain realignment that secures supply for health and life sciences and semiconductor manufacturing. For example, we\u2019re seeing an expansion of both organic and contract manufacturing for life sciences capacity in the U.S., Ireland and Denmark. And in Singapore, we\u2019re bringing a world class team of clinical specialists and facility experts to reimagined sustainable patient-centered care models for expanded facilities at Alexandra Hospital. To address the global semiconductor shortage, Jacobs\u2019 leveraging global resources, expertise, and design automation to deliver critical capacity expansion for multiple semiconductor manufacturing clients in the U.S. and Europe. In a related industry, Jacobs is working with clients in all phases of the electric vehicle ecosystem, implementing state-of-the-art facilities that co-locate lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle production to improve system delays and resilience. Across geographies, alternative fuel planning continues to drive investment for transportation agencies with recent awards for Michigan and Nevada DoT to unlock U.S. Infrastructure Act Funding. Moving to Climate Response. Jacobs remains on the forefront of advising our clients on true carbon impacts in areas ranging from biodegradable materials with an award from NatureWorks to embodied carbon calculations with a recent study for a major data center client. We\u2019re seeing material pipeline growth in our climate response and energy transition portfolio, as evidenced by wins with national grid in the UK to deliver innovative clean energy transmission, a wind farm in Australia, large coastal resiliency programs in Louisiana, and an offshore wind project in the Northeastern United States to convert and underutilized port to support one of the largest most advanced offshore wind facilities in the country. In addition, our innovation investments in PFAS solutions have resulted in an award for its first-of-its-kind program to study nature-based remediation options at more than 35 airports across Australia. Moving to Data Solutions, our deep domain expertise combined with our digital platforms to bring world class technology-enabled solutions to our clients. Our recent acquisition StreetLight is working with Siemens and New York State to forecast impacts of renewables and EV charging infrastructure to plan strategic investment upgrade. In the UK, Jacobs and PA Consulting are transforming Hampshire  with multi-sector digitally enabled solutions to support economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection. Additionally, we\u2019ve had an exciting new win for smart connected and secure infrastructure with national highways and confidential manufacturing clients. Now, discussing infrastructure modernization, faced with aging infrastructure and financial and social equity challenges, Jacobs is helping our clients to reimagine infrastructure. In Melbourne, our delivery excellence resulted in a renewed contract with Yarra Valley Water representing up to 18 years of partnership. In Los Angeles, we are expanding our legacy of being a trusted adviser to the Department of Water and Power by delivering a $17 billion master plan development for water reuse facilities. And for the Port of Alaska, we were recently awarded a contract extension to create a safer, more efficient and resilient port with coastal protection. This quarter, we saw significant growth in rail and transit with 2 clients awarding Jacobs their largest expansion ever. This includes an underground rail line in Singapore and New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority leveraging of the U.S. Infrastructure Act to strengthen the regional rail system and equitably bridge communities. We also expanded our portfolio in Continental Europe in partnership with NIRAS with two 8-year framework agreements for the Copenhagen Metro and the Greater Copenhagen Light Rail. Overall, we\u2019re seeing double-digit pipeline growth that is strengthening due to global infrastructure stimulus across transportation, water, energy and environment, as well as advanced manufacturing. Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 8, as Steve mentioned, PA had another impressive quarter. Their unique digital consultancy services enables clients to accelerate new growth ideas from concept through to commercial success. This allows PA to capitalize quickly and efficiently on global trends and growth markets such as climate response, and health and life sciences. Specifically in the health market, PA continues to use it skills as a force for good, and it\u2019s currently advising the American College of Emergency Physicians on how to build and operate a first-of-its-kind national registry. This next generation digital platform will transform healthcare for the nation\u2019s infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Focusing on climate response, there are 2 examples which demonstrate the breadth of PAs capabilities. The first is for the UK government where PA provided consultancy services for a launch of a new infrastructure fund to drive the rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country. Secondly, PA and the Swedish R&D and IP company PulPac continue to accelerate their exclusive global development partnership for the revolutionary patented technology. PulPac uses renewable pulp and cellulose to produce fiber-based packaging and single use products as an alternative to plastics creating up to 80% lower CO2 footprint. The partnership recorded 3 strategic confidential win this quarter and have developed a solid go-to market plan to the United States. It is evident from all these examples that PA continues to be a crucial part of our strategy with their alignment to Jacobs\u2019 3 growth accelerators. I had the privilege of joining the 1-year PA Consulting and Jacobs\u2019 celebratory road show last month, attending sessions at 6 different PA offices in 4 different countries. PA CEO, Ken Toombs, and I met over 1,300 PA employees with extremely positive feedback. We continue to build on collective success during our first year, and I look forward to continued collaborative successes for our clients and the world. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob, and good day to all that are joining us on the call today. Like to turn to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter fiscal 2022 results. Second quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year, although net revenue grew 10% and was up 3% pro forma for acquired revenue. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points, and given current spot FX rates, we expect FX pressure to continue for the remainder of the year. Exiting Q2, we fully lapped the impact from the lower margin CMS procurement contract and the timing difference between our 2 large environmental remediation contracts. For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect total net revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26.6%, up 80 basis points driven by improvement in People & Places and PAs improved mix impact, partially offset by the revenue ramp from the large new environmental remediation project win in CMS. Looking past 2022, as we execute against our strategy to drive a higher technology and consulting revenue mix. We expect our gross margins to continue to expand. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 16.5% down slightly from our first quarter. Within G&A, we are making investments to prepare for the increase in opportunities from the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure stimulus, as well as other investments to improve the efficiency of businesses, who are focused 2023 initiative. We expect our G&A as a percentage of revenue to trend lower for the remainder of the fiscal year. GAAP operating profit was $166 million and was mainly impacted by $99 million charge associated with the Legacy CH2M Matter we disclosed in April and other related legal costs. Also included in GAAP operating profit was $48 million of amortization costs from acquired intangibles. Other acquisition deal costs and restructuring efforts were $18 million, with around half related to acquisition related costs. Adjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 7% year-over-year, and down slightly on a pro forma basis. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.1%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.68 per share, and included the $0.63 charge related to the settlement of the previously mentioned Legacy CH2M Matter and related legal costs. A $0.25 impact related to our amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.09 of transaction and other restructuring costs, which continue to trend significantly lower and a $0.07 impact from a higher tax rate in the quarter versus our expected rate for the full year. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.72. Jacobs consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $340 million, and was up nearly 3% year-over-year and represented 10.4% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, the revenue book-to-bill ratio was just under 1.94 times, but was 1.12 on a gross profit basis, as we saw a continued increase in profitability in our backlog. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS Q2 revenue was up 4% year-over-year and up 3% on our pro forma basis. FX negatively impacted growth by nearly 100 basis points. During the quarter, CMS revenue growth left the impact from the contract run off of a lower margin large procurement contract and benefited from the timing of our large DOE environmental remediation win at Idaho. As a result, we expect CMS revenue to show double-digit second half 2022 revenue growth driven by strong performance in space intelligence from our recent large new award continued increase from the large environmental contracts to its expected full run rate. Accelerating performance in our telecom business driven by a strategic relationships with 5G providers and Cyber and Intel awards delayed during the continuing resolution beginning to ramp. Q2 CMS operating profit was $113 million, down 1%. Operating profit margin was down approximately 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%. As expected, operating margins were impacted by the ramp up of our large environmental remediation win and the delay of the higher margin shorter cycle awards that were pushed to the right do the continuing resolution. We expect operating profit margin to trend slightly above Q2 levels for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Moving to People & Places, Q2 net revenue was up 2.8% year-over-year and was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from foreign exchange. Our advanced facilities business net revenue growth, again, was up double-digits year-over-year, driven by investments in the semiconductor and pharma supply chains. We expect continued robust growth from advanced facilities throughout fiscal 2022. Our international business also had strong Q2 year-over-year growth, despite the impact from currency determined by more steady government funding. For the second half of fiscal 2022, we expect net revenue growth from our international business to moderate with pressure from the unfavorable impact of FX. Moving to People & Places Americas, net revenue growth in Q2 improved from Q1 driven by front end work related to the infrastructure stimulus. We\u2019re seeing the benefit from the budget resolution and meaningful build in our 12 to 18 months pipeline from the infrastructure stimulus projects. Our second quarter gross margin bookings and pipeline provides us confidence in sequential gross profit growth in the second half of fiscal 2022 versus the first half. Total P&PS Q2 gross profit grew year-over-year, but Q2 operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by increased G&A expenses as we continued to spend, again, strategic investments that position us for the projected acceleration in our business longer term. In terms of PAs performance, PA contributed $297 million in revenue, and $68 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q2 revenue grew 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars and 19% in constant currency. Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 23%. As a quick reminder, PA grew revenue and constant currency 24% year-over-year for fiscal year 2021 and delivered a 23% operating profit margin, thus making year-to-date revenue and margin performance even more impressive. Our non-allocated corporate expenses were $41 million, up year-over-year and within our expectations as medical costs moderated. We now expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be at the lower end of our previously communicated range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another quarter of solid cash flow generation with $96 million from reported free cash flow, which was in line with our expectations given the timing of PA employee tax-related costs associated with their annual bonus payments, and the net working capital impact of discrete items which effectively offset each other. DSOs ticked up modestly year-over-year driven by the timing of new CMS wins and the ramp of the large environment Idaho win in our CMS line of business. The quarter\u2019s cash flow included a net $40 million cash benefit related to monetizing an Australian dollar FX had related to the CH2M legal matters settlement partially offset by cash restructuring. To date since March, we have repurchased approximately $135 million of our shares. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistically repurchase our shares. Next quarter, we expect free cash flow to be affected by the gross cash settlement of the CH2M related legal matter of $480 million, with nearly $100 million in cash tax benefits, partially offsetting that amount over the next few quarters. Adjusting for the impact of the legal sub settlement, other restructuring items, we remain on track toward achieving our onetime free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income target and expect similar or better free cash flow conversion going forward. As a result of the strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.2 billion resulting in $2 billion of net debt. Pro forma for the legal settlement, and including our estimated second half cash flow, we expect Q4 net debt to adjusted 2022 EBITDA of approximately 1.5 times a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which we recently announced. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve for Slide 14. Steve Demetriou : Thank you, Kevin. Our diverse portfolio has proven resilient, providing us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios with an asset-light business model and the ability to manage pricing during an inflationary environment. Given our increased visibility and competence for fiscal 2022, we are tightening our outlook and maintaining the midpoint guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.385 billion to $1.435 billion from the $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion previous guidance. And our adjusted EPS outlook is now in the range of $6.95 to $7.35 from $6.85 to $7.45, previously. Looking past fiscal 2022, our backlog performance and increasing sales pipeline provides us with the continued conviction in achieving the multi-year financial growth targets we provided during our March strategy launch. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question will come from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Adam on for Jerry today. Good morning. Jonathan Doros : Unidentified Analyst : Hello, can you hear me? Hello? Operator : Adam, you\u2026 Jonathan Doros : We\u2019re switching over to another line in case you can\u2019t hear us? With that line, so can you repeat the question, please? Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Adam on for Jerry, can you hear me? Jonathan Doros : Yes, we can hear you. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about recent FX movements in context with the guidance? Kevin Berryman : Yeah, look \u2013 thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good one. As we\u2019ve seen actually over the last week a significant change in uncertain of the foreign exchange rates, specifically in pound sterling. But we do think that there\u2019s some incremental challenges in the second half relative to the potential associated with that probably $0.05 plus. But it\u2019s almost in the range of being able to offset that with other things going on in our guidance for the year. So as we think about going forward, certainly, there\u2019s an incremental risk profile that\u2019s developed over the last couple of days. But effectively, we\u2019re still holding to the gains at this point in time and we\u2019ll obviously be monitoring that on an ongoing basis. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then in your strategy update, you laid out expectations for PA Consulting revenues to grow 12% to 15% CAGR through 2024, but with margins flat. Is the assumption for flat margins the result of changing geographic mix? And then once we get a steady mix, how should we think about margin expansion in this business? Kevin Berryman : I think that there\u2019s a couple of things going on as it relates to the mix dynamic. As we have said, in the past, the incremental strength of that business, even over and above kind of what the plans have been, both in our deal model and for the team at PA. They\u2019ve been running at very, very high utilization factors, which we don\u2019t believe is sustainable longer term. So it\u2019s really more about getting back to a utilization rate that\u2019s probably more sustainable longer-term, which mitigates upward trends in gross margin and profitability. But that ultimately, that level of profitability is being held longer-term just because of the incremental strength of the margin profile of the new business coming in. So all-in-all, while it\u2019s a flat margin outlook, it\u2019s a really strong underlying because they\u2019re actually increasing or decreasing their utilization by factors, which has been offset by underlying gross margin improvements in the business. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bert Subin : Hi, good morning. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Bert Subin : Bob, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned semi and EV CapEx is rising cost the industry, I think that comes as no surprise to anyone. How are you thinking about the growth progression of advanced facilities as you sort of marched towards your $10 EPS target? Bob Pragada : Strong. I think that right now that business, Bert, it\u2019s anywhere from 12 to 18 months kind of look forward, sometimes 6 for the first time in a long time for us being in that space. We\u2019re seeing visibility from a pipeline perspective well into 2023, and in certain cases into 2024. So, in this strategy cycle, it will play a play on material part. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Mike. Bob Pragada : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Maybe for, I mean, have you intrigued about a couple of things. One, could you discuss maybe, Bob, the pipeline, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that $25 billion and $15 billion on CMS side. We will have more discussion on the pipeline opportunities you mentioned just now the event facilities, but other areas, I said, you indicate some more international exposure that could be supportive in addition to what\u2019s the IIJ will provide. And Kevin, the book-to-bill on the margin of 1.12 is an interesting data point. How\u2019s that compare? How\u2019s that trend? And, as we think about not only better bookings, but better margins into that backlog and over the next, say, several quarters. Jonathan Doros : Hey, Bob or Kevin, who want to go first? Steve Demetriou : I\u2019ll pick it up here. It\u2019s Steve. So the look on \u2013 as far as moving to the other, Kevin talked about PA. But as far as P&PS goes, as Bob said, we\u2019re going to see continued strength in advanced facilities moving through the rest of this year and into the next few years. And then on the back of that, we\u2019re going to start to see the Americas business wrap up, we\u2019re already seeing the pipeline significantly increase, we\u2019ll start to see sequential growth in the second half of this year and P&PS U.S. And we expect that to really start to ramp up more significantly as we enter 2023. As far as the infrastructure stimulus, that incremental $550 billion of money that is going to flow into the U.S., about close to $100 billion has been specifically earmarked for defined programs and projects. And, we\u2019re tracking that and obviously, in the front end of that grant process, early on a lot of that is going to be formulaic. And so that should start to flow nicely as we enter 2023. And then our federal infrastructure business and environmental, because of a lot of the dynamics going on globally should really be also something that\u2019s going to help drive growth. On the Critical Mission Solutions, what\u2019s really playing out nicely as the diversity of our portfolio. Right now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in telecom, obviously, the space intelligence and the fact that that classified win, cyber and intelligence is going to start to ramp up now as the continued resolution that finalized. And the ramp-up of our nuclear businesses is robust. And we have an excellent pipeline of opportunities that should start to hit as we finish up this year, and rolling to 2023. So, all-in-all, we\u2019re pretty excited about the prospects of the second half, and especially as we move into 2023 and beyond. And as far as that gross profit, book-to-bill \u2013 the bookings in the last quarter specifically, was more significant and margin because of a higher professional services ratio. And so, what we are seeing is an increase in book-to- bill on our gross profit, as you\u2019ve outlined, that we\u2019re pretty excited about that going forward. Operator : And next, we have a question from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Kevin, I heard a very clear top-line growth outlook for CMS in the second half, but I\u2019m not sure I heard one for PPS. I\u2019m just curious, is there still some variability there that that keeps you from putting some bumpers on the PPS trajectory into the second half? I guess, what I\u2019m really trying to get at is that, all in sort of exit growth rate as we\u2019re going into 2023? So any color or perspective you can provide around that would be very helpful. Kevin Berryman : Look, the dynamic associated with calling out of the CMS is really, because of the strong growth that we\u2019re seeing in the second half of the year, what CMS wanted to make sure that we call that out. It\u2019s not editorial comment on lack of growth in People & Places. We do believe sequentially, we\u2019re going to be able to see some growth as we get into Q3, and when you compare to the year ago figures that that means an accelerating level of growth as well. So look it\u2019s not necessarily in the double-digit figures that we were talking about in CMS, but we see sequential growth in third quarter versus second quarter, even stronger in Q4 versus Q3. So, we think, we\u2019re getting positioned for a strong Q2 \u2013 2023 as a result of that. So look, I think, what\u2019s really attributed to the teams here is a great work that our program management office is doing and really highlighting and helping sort out the incremental monies that are going to be coming into play for the infrastructure bill, and helping our customers figure out when that\u2019s going to hit where they aren\u2019t going to be able to gain access. And I think that\u2019s going a long way for us to start to identify that longer-term build in our infrastructure pipeline. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. Steve Demetriou : And just to \u2013 the one other point about P&PS that as we look at sequentially moving into the third, fourth quarter is the \u2013 a margin profile is going to improve with the G&A that we pre-invested that Kevin talked about that held down on margins in the second quarter. We\u2019re going to start to see a significant change in the utilization of that G&A that\u2019s going to give us a much better profile in the second half on a margin. Operator : And our next question will come from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Brandon on for Chad. Can you please give some more color on the volume of new inquiries on the infrastructure design side? How\u2019s that picked up year-over-year? And when do you think this activity will peak over the next few years? Jonathan Doros : Bob, can you hear that? Bob Pragada : Sure. Yeah, I did. So, incrementally, when you look at it from Q2 to Q2 standpoint, 2021 to 2022. But if you look at the bookings profile of what we accomplished in Q2, and how those jobs burn over the course of the next 2 to 3 quarters, it is a unique inflection point that we\u2019re seeing in the business. And those are on the front end studies, and on some of these more lumpy jobs that were actually already in the planning mode. And now when the CR  was approved, and monies were available. These were the immediate recipients of these jobs, which are going to really hone in on that design component. So we\u2019re actually feeling good outside of the U.S., we are seeing some of the biggest rail and transit opportunities haven\u2019t booked them yet. But we\u2019re in the middle of them that we have in quite a bit \u2013 quite a long time, specifically in the UK and in Australia, so overall positive. Operator : And our next question will come from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. So you narrow your range and that suggests more confidence in your outlook in general. I guess, wondering what you see as still the biggest areas of uncertainties. And more typically, with Jacobs, we would expect kind of still some upside potential on the upper end of the range. So by taking that down, I\u2019m wondering if there are other things that that we should be considering here this sort of upside scenarios and downside scenarios, Steve Demetriou : Yeah, I think, obviously, raising the bottom was an indication of more confidence. The top side, I\u2019d say is, what\u2019s on our mind is the FX uncertainty that\u2019s out there, specifically. And just the question of with all this political activity, geopolitical activity, just how projects and programs are going to get across the finish line and get awarded. We\u2019re confident that there\u2019s no concern about anything getting canceled, it\u2019s really more around just the timing of how things unfold in the second half. And so that\u2019s where we sort of decided to keep our midpoint where it is in spite of the strong second quarter. Operator : And our next question will come from   with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a commentary around invest the strategic investments ahead of the infrastructure bill, can you maybe talk about where in the lifecycle of those investments you are? Is this something that\u2019s going to continue until you sort of have full run rate contribution from the bill? And just the second part in terms of the indicator, there\u2019s some gains coming in from the U.S. IIJ. How are those coming in relative to what you would have expected at this point in the timeline things? Steve Demetriou : Let me go first, and certainly address the strategic investments. We have investments that are supporting the focus 2023 initiatives, which are substantive this year, specifically, and will depending upon how the program goes forward will be less into the future, but more substantive this year specifically. I think the biggest number though, in terms of the investments really are people related, because we\u2019re building up our employee headcount, specifically relative to be able to satisfy the developing pipeline that\u2019s there. And ultimately, when that translates into our backlog and starts to burn, we need to make sure we\u2019re ahead of the curve as it relates to being able to deliver the high quality and strategic value added solutions that we provide to our clients. So that\u2019s the single biggest. So as we start to get that momentum build, which we talked about sequential growth in People & Places and CMS, when you have a particular part of our teams, which are occupied 50% of the time versus 85% of the time that that idle time ultimately is charged to our G&A figure. So as we start to ramp that G&A numbers are going to come, those G&A numbers come down, profitability goes up. And fundamentally, that\u2019s the single biggest investment we\u2019re making this in terms of the people. Operator : And our next question will come from Andy Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Wittmann : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for, Kevin, I wanted to ask about the adjusted unallocated corporate expense, comments that you had here in the prepared remarks, I guess, you said, you\u2019re going to be at the lower end of the $200 million to $250 million range. I guess, in the quarter it came in at $41 million had been running in the mid-50s. The guidance it just implies that the last 2 quarters, they are going to be around 50 each if it\u2019s the very low end. And so that implies that something unique happened in the fiscal second quarter, and I was wondering if you could discuss what that was that made it so low in the second quarter? And if you could also talk a little bit more about the tax rate in the quarter, the $0.07 that you called out there? What was that related to? It sounds like your tax rate is going to be higher? Was this an adjustment only for this year? Or was this for a prior period outside of this year as to why that $0.07 was called out? Kevin Berryman : No. Look, let me go to the G&A first and talk about that really is a matter of timing, as to when we\u2019re making the investments as opposed to one we\u2019re not. And so think about it really from a timing perspective, in terms of the management of our programs, and we don\u2019t pre-spend when we don\u2019t need to. So ultimately think about it from a timing perspective, that\u2019s really all it is, Andy. As it relates to the other issue on tax, but effectively, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, beginning last year, we took to on our adjusted tax rate, just to book to what our expected effective tax rate is going to be for the year. And then, of course, our GAAP rate fluctuates around that either plus or minus relative to that. So really, this is just an adjustment to get back to put that effective tax rate is going to be on an adjusted basis for the full year. Until which time we think that number is different, we will always book to that adjusted figure in the quarter so that really is all it is. And it\u2019s just the difference between the GAAP and the adjusted figure that we expect for the full year. Hopefully, that\u2019s clear. Operator : And we have a follow-up from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bert Subin : Thanks so much for the follow-up. I just got cut off earlier and had a quick clarification question for Bob. On the advanced facilities commentary, the visibility, you mentioned sort of being more extended, is that the result of just what we\u2019re seeing on the semiconductor CapEx side? Or are you also starting to see a step function change on the EV and biotech side? Thanks again for the question. Bob Pragada : Yeah, Bert is both. Semiconductor side, it\u2019s really kind of the concentration of clients that we have and those clients being on the forefront of the chip shortage. And as well as one of those clients that we\u2019ve talked about before also changing a bit of the business model to become more of a foundry. So that\u2019s extending out that visibility. From an EV perspective, the biggest one is one that\u2019s driving some of that visibility and the spend that company is going through, but these not just the classic OEMs, the Fords, the GMs. But we\u2019re seeing kind of this next generation of EV providers come into play, which is giving us greater visibility to 2023 and beyond. So we\u2019re getting that information from our clients not necessarily exclusively market data. Operator : And our next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Kevin Berryman : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Maybe you could give us a little more color into the double-digit growth forecast for CMS in the second half of the year, which I think is better than some of your government services peers, obviously, we know about Idaho, ramping up and some of the recent wins. But how much is cyber helping? For instance, I think you mentioned telecom ramping up and one of your peers suggested space is a little sluggish right now, but it doesn\u2019t seem like that for you? Kevin Berryman : Look, as I outlined in our previous remarks earlier in the call. And yes, look, I think there\u2019s a multitude of things. There\u2019s a little bit of incremental revenue we\u2019ll see from the ramp on the Idaho project. That\u2019s not the driver. That\u2019s ultimately a small piece of it. It really is the incremental space intelligence business that\u2019s starting to burn relative to the wind that we announced. I think it was last quarter and that\u2019s going to be helping drive some incremental growth. And then, of course, we also are seeing good cybersecurity ramp in terms of the continuing resolution was putting pressure as it relates to that opportunity. So those are all positives, as it relates to telecom, while it\u2019s not a huge part of our business. It is a high growth business that\u2019s occurring, given the focus on the 5G stuff. So all of that added together, I think, exhibits the power of the diversity of the portfolio within CMS. And until we\u2019re excited about getting back to really strong growth numbers in Q3 and Q4, and we\u2019ve been calling out that we expected it to happen, and now it\u2019s going to be happening. Operator : And our next question will come from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I apologize. I\u2019m managing through 4 calls. But, we\u2019re getting lots of questions from investors on just \u2013 which business models would be more resilient, during a potential recession, given the macro concerns out there? So can you sort of just help me understand which parts of your business would be more resilient sort of on a top line and margin side? And to what degree do some of the restructuring and cost cutting actions help you and as well how PA Consulting performed in prior downturns? And then, Kevin, my other question, just \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, if you ask this \u2013  , then I can just go back. But to what degree, what are you thinking right now, in terms of preference for repo versus acquisition, I know you did buyback stock and acquire, but any help there? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Let me start with resilience. Let\u2019s turn it over to Kevin, for the capital deployment question. But look, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this, Jamie, as you know, and we believe we really positioned our portfolio going forward to be even more resilient than Jacobs in the past, which had a good resilient track record. Clearly leading that is going to be the infrastructure side with the fact that as we get into potential uncertainty and economic sluggishness that governments around the world, especially in the U.S. We\u2019re going to look to stimulate the economy and create jobs with infrastructure. And then on top of that, we\u2019ve got the IIJA that law. And so we\u2019re pretty positive about the momentum on that in the backlog, that pipeline that\u2019s building, and that\u2019s going to play out. And then, of course, we have \u2013 what\u2019s going on with the whole geopolitical side, the increased needs around defense spending and cyber protection and critical infrastructure around the world. And so that\u2019s going to bode well for resiliency on our critical mission solutions. And then even in the advanced facilities business, which could be historically impacted by economic slowdown with the dynamics of a chip shortage, which is going to continue even in some economic downturn, and the need to pent-up demand on life sciences, because of all the focus on the pandemic, and the energy transition that has to happen. We feel pretty good about where Jacob stands, uncertain environment going forward. Kevin, on the capital deployment? Kevin Berryman : Yeah, we \u2013 thanks, Jamie, for the question. We like the investment in the shares at this current time. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t a list of opportunities on the M&A side that that could potentially be executed against with the recent large settlement that we will be paying out in relative to the impacts. We\u2019re probably not doing any real large deals at this particular point in time, but certainly given the dislocation in our share price over the last few months. So we\u2019d like that investment. So I think, certainly, repos are in the mix and probably maybe some smaller acquisitions. Operator : And that will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Steve Demetriou for any closing remarks. Steve Demetriou : Thanks everyone for your attention and focus, and we look forward to talking to you next year. Thanks. Operator : And I will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Jonathan Doros, you may begin your conference. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website, which we will reference during the call. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures, and pro forma figures. For pro forma comparisons the current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions, including StreetLight Data and BlackLynx, as well as our strategic investment in PA Consulting for the full fiscal period. Ken: Steve will begin by reviewing our third quarter results, and then discuss our Jacobs and PA accelerating social impact. Bob will then review our performance by line of business, Ken will provide an update on PA Consulting, and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion about financial metrics as well as review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Steve will provide details on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open the call for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we have provided additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : All right, thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2022 business performance and our near term outlook. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to be conducting today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call on PA Consulting offices in London and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide more color in just a moment on our strong early on success of our investment in PA. But first turning to Slide 4, at Jacobs the combination of a proactive approach to strategic portfolio management and driving a high performance culture has created a touch quality business with substantial recurring revenue that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resilient during a variety of macroeconomic conditions. This is complemented by our focus on secular growth in the areas of Climate Response, Consulting & Advisory and Data Solutions. Our competitive advantage is based on strength staying true to our values. We harness a deep technical expertise to reinvent the way we solve problems and chase the next generation of innovative solutions for our clients. As I shift to the quarterly results, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly seeing strong underlying trends in accelerated growth at Jacobs. From the velocity of our sales pipeline, our recent major wins that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about today and next quarter, to increasing trends in utilization, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re positioned for strong profitable growth going forward. During the quarter net revenue grew 8% year-over-year and double digits on a constant currency basis, with growth across each line of business. More importantly, bookings were strong across the company, resulting in revenue backlog up 10% year-over-year and actually up 13% in constant currency. We saw continued strong performance in our Advanced Facilities business as demonstrated by our 25% year-over-year top line growth and an acceleration in P&PS  bookings during the quarter within our Americas business, driven by awards related to the U.S. infrastructure modernization. Within Critical Mission Solutions, we were awarded a strategic $3.9 billion NASA Johnson 10-year rebate significantly larger than our existing contract and which will be added to our backlog in the fourth quarter. This is one of many long-term recurrent contracts that provide revenue visibility for the business. On a constant currency basis, PA Consulting continued to show strong growth with revenue up 22% and backlog up 19% year-over-year. The strong visibility of our diverse business with upside from secular growth trends combined with robust cash flow generation affords us the ability to generate returns for our shareholders in times of economic uncertainty. Now turning to Slide 5. This time two years ago in the height of the pandemic we were zeroing in on the PA Consulting transaction, and PA  is significantly exceeding our financial expectations and revenue synergies are accelerating. Results are strong across all PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peak performance indicators. In Culture and Talent the number of partners has increased more than 20% since the transaction closed, with additional key hires across operations, research, technology and sales, further strengthening PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities in client solutions. And very exciting is their women and leadership program with the current PA leadership team now at 50% female. Financial performance continues strong with the weighted pipeline up more than 40% compared to the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date revenues are up 20% in constant currency with an operating margin of 21%, which is an indicator of PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high quality business. On the Operations and Strategy front, PA is seeing success following the launch of it IP monetization, and they are gaining momentum in the U.S. with new leadership and an expanding portfolio. And in the area of revenue synergies we have posted 18 joint wins since the beginning of the partnership and are seeing significant collaborative opportunities in multiple markets, including health and life sciences, energy and utilities, and consumer products. Our partnership with PA has been one of the most successful in value creating investments and our Consulting and Advisory accelerator is a clear priority for future capital deployment. Turning to Slide 6. A key to our successful partnership has been the close alignment of our purpose around creating solutions that have positive social impact, whether it's working together to improve healthcare for families through leading edge cell and gene therapy, addressing patient safety and emergency departments across the U.S., solving issues of connectivity and decarbonization for global rail market, delivering resilient solutions in the areas of deforestation and fire prevention in the UK, and the undergrounding of 10,000 miles of cable for PG&E to mitigate forest fires in California, and on the clean energy front, collaborating on analyzing investments for private equity and green hydrogen. Once again, looking ahead, we believe our partnership with TA is critical to delivering our new Jacobs strategy. Now I'll turn it over to Bob Pragada to discuss our line of businesses. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions. The CMS business continued its strong performance in the third quarter with total backlog increasing 7% on a reported basis and reported on a pro forma basis to $10.2 billion. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient, recurring revenue growth and market expansion by offering technology enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Our service and solution offering are delivered across our core customers markets, space, national security, cyber intelligence, and energy environment and we are leveraging our growth accelerators of data solutions, climate response in Consulting and Advisory to catalyze the business. We have substantial revenue visibility as approximately 85% of CMS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolio consists of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than four years and 88% from federal level government funding. Although economic and geopolitical uncertainties continue, our strong Q3 ending backlog gives us confidence in our next 12 months forecast of revenue. Three market trends that we see contributing to our continued growth include space debris management, robotics, and 5G network build out. Beginning with space debris management, decades of space travelers resulted in large amounts of space debris damage to the satellites and future launches, adding to the cost of operating satellites and other space platforms like the International Space Station or ISS. If debris destroys a satellite, it can take months and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to restore its service. We support the orbital debris tracking program at NASA and provide plume analysis and communication systems, simulation for vehicles visiting the ISS. In addition, we provide media tracking data for multiple government agencies. Space debris tracking is one of many services Jacobs provides on the recently awarded Johnson Engineering, Technology and Science or JETS II contract with builds on Jacobs more than 17 years of continuous support at Johnson Space Center. Under this contract, we will provide multidisciplinary technical services to support the future of human space exploration, as well as help NASA incubate the emerging commercial space economy. This 10-year $3.9 billion win will book in Q4 and represents a $1.8 billion increase to our existing contract. This serves to illustrate the continuing strong, massive Jacobs partnership. Moving on to robotics. We are increasingly delivering valued solutions to our clients by utilizing robots that reduce costs and increase accuracy and safety in otherwise manual human processes. And we're excited to announce the last quarter we integrated the Resolve robotics team in the UK into CMS, who brings software expertise and IP to help accelerate our growth. Our existing CMS robotics team already delivers groundbreaking innovations, developing and deploying robotics systems in challenging environments such as the robotic tool to retrieve sand like debris from inside a damaged nuclear reactor at Fukushima in Japan, autonomous systems to map riverbeds for the British army, and designing robotic systems for ITER, the world's largest fusion power experiment. Finally demand for 5G telecommunications. Our telecom group provides full solutions for the deployment of next generation wireless and wireline networks for leading telecommunication companies like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as Fortune 1000 healthcare and commercial companies looking to build their own 5G networks. We also support the infrastructure market providing 5G integration, network optimization, and technical services alongside our PMPs teams to accelerate growth. While rollout of 5G infrastructure deployment is still in its early ramp phase, we continue to see increased demand for both integrated 4G and 5G solutions from our commercial telco infrastructure, healthcare and government clients. During the quarter, our telecom group added several new awards, total more than $150 million to deliver projects advancing 5G nationwide. We are excited for the team's recent successes and are well positioned for growth as adoption of 5G use cases and penetration growth. In summary, we continue to see solid demand for our CMS solutions. Last week, we were notified that we were awarded a $470 million, six-year cyber and intelligence related task order, which we expect to benefit and begin ramping at the end of this current quarter. The sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business pipeline at approximately $25 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Turning to Slide 8, during the quarter, People & Places Solutions delivered record setting, quarterly bookings that topped pre-pandemic levels. We also enjoyed year-over-year bookings growth of 11% and backlog growth of 13%, delivering a high mark for operating profit in the quarter. Despite macroeconomic concerns, we performed well due to the balance of public and private sector clients with a multinational focus, resulting in continued high percentage of revenue already booked in backlog. As I talk about the quarter, I'll address our four ongoing themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization, climate response, and data solutions. Starting with supply chain diversification. With continued breakthroughs in biotechnology, strong customer demand and robust operating cash flow, life sciences clients are investing in manufacturing expansion and contract operations capacity globally. As a leader in the market, tier one clients have confidence in Jacobs ability to deliver highly complex Greenfield and expansion projects at speed that provides time to market for our clients, that maximizes their competitive advantage in new therapeutics. Growing health service needs are leading to innovative approaches to care. We are optimizing facilities for clients, such as the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, where we serve as their project delivery partner. We are improving sustainability access and energy efficiency for NHS Scotland, as well as increasing much needed access to critical mental healthcare in Australia. We continue to see robust demand for semiconductor chips, data center capacity expansion, and growth in the electric vehicle market and have secured recent confidential wins in all three categories. On top of strong secular demand for semiconductors, we are pleased to see the passing of the $53 billion U.S. CHIPS Bill, which will incentivize investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and specialized tools. Infrastructure modernization. Increased client investments in mega and giga scale infrastructure continues, and with our number one ENR ranking in program management, our delivery reputation has been a key differentiator in staying ahead of our client's needs in a dynamic global environment. We recently have been awarded several strategic full lifecycle programs for new transformative scale cities in the Middle East that will address social, economic and climate priorities, and we'll have flexible and long-term contracting vehicles. With a renewed interest in equitable, sustainable transportation, we are experiencing a significant investment in the transit and rail sector with wins across the globe, such as Irish Rail, British Railways, multiple clients in Australia and resilient transit planning for Sacramento area Council of Governments here in the U.S. The infrastructure investment in JOBS Act is resulting in a steady increase in new project awards to modernize and increase the resiliency of U.S. infrastructure. For example, we won a major water supply resilience program for Eastern New Mexico Water Utility Authority, a five-year storm water implementation program for the City of Baton Rouge, and a funding strategy with Oklahoma DoT. Additionally, our IIJA advisory team is positioning our clients to win funding opportunities with over 50 differentiated grant applications across transportation, water, and energy. We anticipate additional awards in the coming quarters as the opportunities in our sales pipeline move into the next phase of procurement. Moving to Climate Response. We see our clients continuing to invest in clean energy across all sectors with primary spend related to grid modernization, cost effective renewable energy generation and EV Charging Infrastructure or EVCI. Our progress in these areas is demonstrated globally. In Asia through advisory and policy consulting for the Asia Development Bank, in Canada with a pipeline utility program, in Australia through transmission and distribution design projects with AusNet Services, and in the U.S. via New Consulting and Advisory framework to advance energy transition with a leading provider. Transportation electrification and advanced charging infrastructure plans have topped our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agendas across all regions for aviation, ports, highways and rail and transit. This includes projects for Heathrow Airport in the UK to implement landside EBCI, Ohio DoT Statewide EV Infrastructure program, and a major U.S. Transportation Authority transitioning operations to zero emissions for one of the world's largest bus fleets by 2040. Collectively, this is a very exciting space for us and aligns strongly with our climate response accelerator. Moving to Data Solutions. We are using advanced data analytics to optimize our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decision making as well as their ability to de-risk long-term investments. For example, in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board, our StreetLight Data team is using advanced analytics to better measure and manage transportation emissions. We are also continuing our technology consulting support for a U.S. State DoT with integrated corridor management, connected automated transportation systems, and other advanced mobility solutions to maximize use of their existing transportation infrastructure. In the water market we are awarded a contract with the Water Research Foundation to develop the first full scale deployment of machine learning, predictive control for wastewater systems, a new technology to advance the global water industry. Our Cyber and Digital Services teams were awarded projects in support of the Operational Technology Resiliency plan for a major UK utility network operator. And in Australia, we have secured the Digital and Data Advisory Services scope to support advanced analytics across Brisbane City Council's entire asset lifecycle. In summary, our strong sales pipeline is supported by well-funded government budgets to modernize their infrastructure and commercial clients that are addressing secular growth opportunities. The agility of our global workforce, combined with elevated spend on transformative, complex infrastructure, uniquely positions us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Given these dynamics and the visibility of our revenue in backlog, we are excited in the growth trajectory for our People and Places business, both now and into the future. Ken: Ken Toombs : Thanks Bob. Moving to Slide 9, PA's current quarter continued to see strong sales bookings up 25% and backlog was up 19% in constant currency. Here's what I see driving that. We've unique value proposition that starts with our purpose, bringing ingenuity to life to build a positive human future. This enables us to deliver both , but our purpose is critical in our ability to attract and retain top talent. Our differentiation extends to our strategy, which is focused on helping clients address some of the biggest forces shaping society with our unique end-to-end innovation offering. Indeed having technologists, scientists, engineers, and designers working together creates a unique set of propositions. Let me shift gears and talk a bit about our partnership with Jacobs. As Steve mentioned, our partnership supports key aspects of our strategy. We have numerous key accounts in common. Those accounts are ones where we can leverage PA's relationships at the C-suite to bring Jacobs into the mix early and create a differentiated solution. In some cases it could be the advantage of scale that Jacobs has or a specialized expertise. It can also work the opposite way where Jacobs has a key relationship and brings PA into complex deals. A great example is PG&E in California, where Jacobs has a strong existing relationship. The differentiation on this project was a combination of Jacob's program management expertise with PA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategic consultancy advice and deep domain expertise. And more than a year into the partnership, these types of opportunities are growing. Another area of our strategy is expansion in the United States, where the outlook is very promising with strong double digit revenue growth over the last six months. Beyond the synergies with Jacobs, we see a big demand for our end-to-end services. We're focused on three sectors in particular, energy and utilities, health and life sciences and consumer and manufacturing. In each of these areas we're winning and delivering exciting purpose-driven work. For example, innovating cell and gene therapy manufacturing with Ori Biotech and creating a growth strategy for Green Boom, a startup, which has developed a sustainable way to prevent, reduce and clean up oil spills. Over time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made several U.S. acquisitions which have provided a platform for further organic growth. Additionally, the significant hiring of great new talent at the partner level is another way we are stimulating growth. Since the beginning of 2020, we've grown the number of U.S. partners by 60%. Now I'd like to spend a minute on resiliency of our business. We enjoy a loyal client base with approximately 90% of revenue typically coming from repeat clients over the last five years and our expertise continues to be in high demand. We also enjoy resiliency, given our balance in private and public sector work. For example, during the pandemic, we transformed entire corporate business models to account for new customer behaviors. While in the public sector, we work with some of the biggest government agencies that provide critical services that are largely unaffected by short term budget decisions, like the UK National Health Service and Ministry of Justice. This helps to mitigate risk from future macroeconomic trends. So to summarize, we're running a purpose-driven business with a clear strategy to address our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 biggest challenges in an end-to- end manner that separates us from the competition. And structurally we're set up to be able to pivot in response to external factors, ensuring we're well positioned for the future. Kevin, I'll hand it over to you. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Ken. I'm going to Slide 10 for a financial overview of third quarter fiscal 2022 results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 7% year-over-year and net revenue grew 8%. Pro forma for acquired revenue, net revenue also grew 7% year-over-year, which is an acceleration in growth from the second quarter. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by nearly 400 basis points. And given current foreign exchange spot rates, we expect FX to impact our Q4 revenue by nearly 450 basis points on a year-over-year basis. On a reported basis for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, which translates into double digit growth on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, down 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by our CMS line of business related to newly ramping remediation contracts and the timing of the ramp on higher margin federal contracts, and the investment in incremental resources in PA in advance of expected growth. P&PS: GAAP operating profit was $266 million and was mainly impacted by $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and other acquisition deal related costs and restructuring efforts of $10 million with over half of that associated with integration costs associated with acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit was $327 million, up 4% year-over-year on both a reported and pro forma basis. On a constant currency basis adjusted operating profit was up 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit and net revenue was 10.3% and we expect a similar level in Q4. I'll discuss the moving parts later when reviewing the line of business performance. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.52 and included a $0.27 impact related to our amortization, charge of acquired intangibles, $0.04 from transaction related costs, only $0.02 of other restructuring costs and a $0.01 benefit adjustment to align to our effective tax rate. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.86, up 13% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis FX impacted our EPS negatively by $0.09. Within the other income line on the P&L, important to note, we realized a cash pretax gain of approximately $14 million or $0.08 in after tax EPS from the sale of our ownership and commercial cybersecurity provider WatchGuard Technologies that came as part of the KEYW acquisition. This benefit was captured within our other income line and adjusted EBITDA, but not reflected in operating profit results. The sale of this strategic investment was driven by contract terms associated with our interests, which would have limited future monetization of our investment. We remain excited about our continued partnership with WatchGuard. Jacobs consolidated Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $363 million and was up nearly 13% year-over-year representing 11.4% of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 16% year-over-year. Finally turning to our bookings during the quarter, the revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 times and did not include the estimated $550 million backlog value of the 10-year $3.9 billion for NASA Johnson win, which will be recognized in backlog in our fourth quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, the contract ceilings of this rebid win is significantly higher than our existing contract and is an agency-wide contract not limited to Johnson Space Center. We've planned a backlog for the first two years of the approximate current revenue run rate, but expect on contract growth to the ceiling value over the life of the contract. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, Q3 revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. FX negatively impacted growth by over 200 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to approach double digits and after adjusting for an estimated FX impact of 250 basis points, deliver constant currency double digit growth. Q3 CMS operating profit was $104 million, down 3.5% year-over-year, but flat on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin was down over 90 basis points year-over-year to 7.9%. Q3 operating profit margin percentage continued to be impacted by the delay of the higher margin, shorter cycle awards that were pushed to the right due to the continuing resolution, as well as related timing of our investments ahead of new cyber and intelligence contract wins. Due to these investments and the timing of both new and anticipated awards, we expect CMS operating profit margin to remain under 8% for the fourth quarter, but improving in 2023 and beyond. Moving to People & Places, Q3 net revenue accelerated to 7% year-over-year, both including a negative effect of 350 basis points from FX. On a constant currency basis, P&PS overall grew double digits year-over-year. Also on a constant currency basis, each People & Places segment demonstrated net revenue growth with strong year-over-year growth acceleration in our America's business as impact from U.S. infrastructure spending begins to materialize. Our Advanced Facilities business continues to demonstrate robust double digit net revenue growth with strong performance in both semiconductors and life sciences. We expect this performance to continue given our strong backlog in sales pipeline. Our International business growth on a constant currency basis also remained strong as those governments continue to prioritize infrastructure modernization and investments related to our ESG Solutions. Total P&PS Q3 gross profit grew year-over-year and gross margins were consistent with Q3 2021, with Q3 operating profit up 2% year-over-year and up 8% when eliminating the impact from FX translation. In terms of PA's performance, PA revenue grew 8% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, and impressive 22% in PA's local currency. Q3 adjusted operating profit margin was 18.5% due to lower utilization, but still up 2% when factoring the impact of currency. The lower utilization during Q3 was driven by a proactive effort to add resources for additional growth expected in 2022 and 2023 for the PA team. Consequently, we expect PAs operating profit margin to return to greater than 20% next quarter and continue to strengthen further in 2023. We also expect continued double digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our unallocated corporate costs were $38 million, down year-over-year as we benefited from continuing moderation in medical costs and to a lesser extent from a positive currency impact on our support costs and other benefits. We now expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $170 million to $190 million versus our previously communicated range of $200 million to $250 million for fiscal 2022. Turning to Slide 12 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We had another quarter of solid underlying cash flow generation. On a reported basis free cash flow was a negative $281 million, but included a $480 million cash outflow related to the previously discussed Inpex legal settlement, as well as $10 million related to transaction costs and other items. Excluding these outflows, free cash flow was strong and conversion was in line with our expectations. DSOs were relatively flat year-over-year. We expect solid free cash flow in the fourth quarter, again in light with our previous conversion expectations for the full year. During the quarter we repurchased approximately $200 million of our shares. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares as we see dislocation in the market. As a result of the strong underlying cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and a gross debt of $3.6 billion, resulting in $2.5 billion of net debt. Our net debt to adjusted 2022 expected EBITDA of approximately 1.8 times is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q3, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate pre-payable debt and as a result, we are expecting incremental interest costs going forward, which we have incorporated into our outlook. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which we recently announced. Before I turn it back to Steve I'd like to talk about the resiliency of our portfolio. The portfolio is strong and resilient, aligned around high priority Federal Government spend areas and state and local institutions supported by government stimulus programs. The private sector business is centered on high margin markets like semiconductors and life sciences, which are currently focused on incremental investment and capacity to resolve supply chain constraints and support novel therapies. As a result, while we may not be totally immune to the global economic uncertainties, we are confident that we are positioned to deliver the levels of growth identified in our strategy. Over to you, Steve. Steve Demetriou : All right, thank you, Kevin. As Kevin described we have a diverse portfolio with significant reimbursable recurring revenue, and it provides us the ability to grow under multiple economic scenarios, and manage the impacts of inflationary pressures on our business. With this diversity comes some exposure to foreign currency translation as we have approximately 34% of our revenue outside of the U.S. with 21% of that revenue in UK Pound Sterling. As a result of the latest foreign exchange dynamics, we're providing updated guidance for the fourth quarter of adjusted EBITDA in the range of $340 million to $360 million and an adjusted EPS of $1.75 to $1.85 with the midpoints tied to the current FX rates. We feel very confident in our underlying business trends in the fourth quarter, and it provided the lower end of the range to reflect the possibility of any FX erosion. It is important to note that relative to our fiscal 2022 forecast back in November, foreign currency translation has impacted our full year expected fiscal 2022 net revenue outlook by approximately $320 million, adjusted EBITDA by approximately $40 million and adjusted EPS by nearly $0.20 to ensure our change in annual guidance and EPS is effectively driven by currency volatility versus our original expectations. In closing, we are excited about the momentum across all of our business as demonstrated by our accelerating revenue growth, our strong bookings and backlog, and a robust sales pipeline globally. Operator, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now open the call for questions. Operator :  Your first question comes from a line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : WatchGuard: Kevin Berryman : First point relative to client, look we're really not sensing any significant commentary from clients which are indicating concerns on the impact to their business associated with their investment profile. And look, if you look at the, I'm going to call it the private parts of the portfolio, specifically the life sciences and semiconductors, those clients are really continuing to be quite robust in their outlook. WatchGuard, yes: Operator : Your next question\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Steve Demetriou : The only thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d add\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Go ahead operator. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin from Stifel. Your line is open. Bert Subin : Hi, hey, good morning. Steve Demetriou : Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Bert. Bert Subin : Bob, you mentioned the CHIPS Bill in your prepared marks. How much of a tailwind, if any, should we expect that to be for your fab design business? And then just to a, just a quick follow up to what you were talking about on the resilient side, is it fair to think that the PA consulting would be sort of the most volatile piece of your business as we think about sort of going through a potential economic recession? Thanks. Bob Pragada : Yes. Bert on the first part on the CHIPS Bill, I think the way that we're thinking about it is, is that, that was already such a robust business for us based on the clientele that we have and what the business drivers were for them. But the CHIPS Bill did go as quick, even more credibility as well as substantiation of continued growth for those clients that are actually changing their business model. So I think it's putting more confidence that the cycle that we used to talk about being traditional 18 to 36 months cycles going even further with now support from the Federal Government, so we're, we're excited about that. With regards to the volatility in PA's business, you know, its \u00e2\u0080\u0093 PA is very unique model. It's structured where the traditional management consultant relying on discretionary spend of their clients for business transformation activities is not really where PA sits. PA sits in product innovation and in using that product innovation to transform businesses and so these are really at the core of the clients that they serve. So we're not really seeing -- we're not seeing that as evidenced by the bookings trends that we saw with PA this quarter being at the highest that they've been eventually ever which is really putting some credibility in the backlog moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you just expand Kevin on the, hi. Kevin if you wouldn't mind just expanding on the margin comments in your prepared remarks for Critical Mission Solutions and People & Places exiting the fourth fiscal quarter. You know, it sounds like you've got some idiosyncratic moving pieces that might impact normal seasonality as we head into the December quarter. Can you just tease that out a bit based on contract cadence, et cetera, that you alluded to for full fiscal year 2023? Thanks. Kevin Berryman : Yes, Jerry couple of points. First is on the win profile associated with our CMS business, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been ramping some of the big environmental contracts, the nuclear remediation contracts, which are embedded into our forecast, which as you know, is lower margin. And we've previously discussed that the balance of the year would start to see an uptick in margins because of all of the shorter cycle and cyber and intelligence wins, which are coming. And actually Bob announced that one was, we just heard about this this week actually, and so, or last week and so look at the end of the day, all of those are happening. They're just not happening and won't ramp in Q4 which was our original expectation. So if you look at that dynamic, that puts a little bit of pressure on the Q4 margin that we have in addition to continue to have the investment profile and we're not backing off of that in Q4 because of the anticipation of the growth in 2023 and beyond. So it's a double kind of double impact on Q4, but ultimately then translates into 2023 starting to rebound and come back into the margin profile that we've seen in the past. Now it's going to take a while to get there, but ultimately we're confident that the margin profile will start to kick back up in 2023. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on that discussion about the cyber contracts and you mentioned that $500 million one, I guess that's the one from last week, and I guess I'd call that a mid-sized award compared to the NASA type opportunities. Can you just talk a little bit more about how much more of that you have in the pipeline and the timing of those and then how relatively important they are to that 2023 plan? Steve Demetriou : Yes, so Steve here. Yes, the good news is we actually had two wins in the last 30 days in the cyber intelligence business. There was a $500 million one that did get booked late in the third quarter, and then we've had one just in the last week that Kevin just talked about that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just under $500 million. And those are two good sized cyber intelligence awards with better margins than some of our longer term enterprise contracts that we have in CMS. So they're going be margin are creative and we're really going to see those playing out as early as, you know, as far as the P&L in the first quarter of 2023. So, and then on top of that, we have about $1.5 billion of things that could hit sometime in the fourth quarter, as far as pursuits out there, and if you look at our normal win rate, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to add on top of that. And then on the back of that, there's a series of other pursuit opportunities that will play out sometime in the first half of 2023. So we're, you know, we are excited about cyber intelligence, a little frustrated that it's taken a few quarters longer than we had expected. And then I just want to add on the back of that outside of cyber intelligence, which also gives us some optimism is that the Americas IIJA initiatives, we are clearly seeing momentum now in that. The pipeline is building. We've had some early on wins. We've got about 50 grants out there that we are highly confident of winning a large share of, and that's going to translate into business. And we see that, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s starting to accelerate in 2023. And so it really hasn't been a material impact on our business to date and we all know that that's coming because of the commitment of the U.S. Government around that IIJA. So, those are reasons for optimism as we get into both top line and margin improvement as we enter 2023. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi, good morning guys. Steve Demetriou : Hi Chad. Chad Dillard : So, on the back of the announcement the 2022 Inflation Reduction Bill, particularly the climate change portion, can you give a little bit of color on that and just like how much would be addressable to Jacobs? Steve Demetriou : Yes, it's the, very similar to the IIJA when you look at the climate change portion, which is in the high $300 billion, I think it's somewhere in the $370 billion $380 billion. We see somewhere in the 85% plus coverage by Jacobs of when you break that bill down to what we're able to see so far. And we haven't been able to get a 100% of it, but based on some of the specifics and what we're hearing, it's going to be a majority of it that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be an opportunity for Jacobs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Whitman from Baird. Your line is open. Andrew Whitman : Yes, great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. I guess just a clarification. I think Kevin, in your remarks, you made a comment, there was an FX benefit in your corporate unallocated. Is that the $8 million? And was that like, did you sell a swap or a currency hedge there to realize that? I'm just curious if that was cash or noncash as well? Kevin Berryman : No this is basically translation related efforts or impacts, I should say Andy. So effectively, if you think about the revenue and the gross margin, all of that is negatively impacted by the dollar strength as the foreign currencies get translated into lower revenue and gross margin. That's partially offset by the fact that our costs are also reduced in terms of our international operations. So it's really driven more by that. No effective kind of trend transaction was related to that. Operator : Louie: Louie DiPalma : Good afternoon, Steve, Bob, Kevin and Ken. Steve Demetriou : Hey Louie. Louie DiPalma : With the announcement of this earnings call from PA Consulting from headquarters in London, do you have any plans to acquire the remaining 40% of PA Consulting that you don't already own? Steve Demetriou : Yes, we've talked about this in the past and continue to have the same view that we really love the model that we've set up for the investment in PA and think it not only is unique, but it's one of the reasons why we were able to get that and to get this investment across the finish line. And, yes, there could be a scenario where we incrementally grow our ownership, but right now over the long-term we think having the PA partners and employees have ownership and the collaborative opportunities that that gives us is really part of, is really a key reason why we're off to such a strong start in the first year plus. And so we see that kind of model continuing going forward. Operator : Michael Feniger : Michael Feniger : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I realize you added in some areas investing in people, adding resources for the stronger growth outlook. You're talking about CMS, how some of these cyber contracts, which are higher margin are going to pick up next year. Just based on what you're saying and the expected pickup in funding, should we be seeing an outsized level of margin expansion in 2023 as utilization levels are likely to pick up? Kevin Berryman : Hey, Michael, is this Kevin. Is your comment about CMS specifically? Michael Feniger : It's about overall the mix of the business? Kevin Berryman : Well look, if we look at our margin profile just in Q3 and Q4, we do believe there's going to be an ability to increase margins as we come out of this dynamic that we're facing in Q3, Q4, where growth hasn't kicked in as much as we want or continuing to invest. So we do believe that there's margin upside in 2023 versus current level. But I wouldn't say extraordinary because we're going to ultimately continue to drive investments and support our business ability to grow longer term and at higher gross margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company. Your line is open. Josh Sullivan : Hey, good morning or good afternoon. You know, as far as the Russian war with Ukraine and rising tensions in the Taiwanese Strait, could you just talk about, if you've seen any specific uptick in demand for Jacobs capabilities, space, cyber, is it -- you've seen international demand or mostly domestic? And then I guess a related question to the commercial side, what does the flow of European energy projects look like at this point? Steve Demetriou : Yes, Josh, I I'd say two. Yes, the short answer is yes. We have seen an uptick in the client conversations and the -- and just the dialogue around potential opportunities. I'd break it down into two main parts and then to address your energy comment in Europe. For cyber services, yes these are predominantly U.S. based framework agreements that we have in place. And we've seen efforts around those agreements be applied to cyber intelligence activities, specifically surrounding what's going on in the Ukraine. And then the second part has been around defense infrastructure. And so you mentioned what's happening in the Taiwanese Straits, you probably say that our posture, well, when I say the Western hemisphere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture around defense infrastructure in Asia has been going on for the better part of a decade. But now, in addition to that, we're seeing more requests. In fact, we've been awarded, they're confidential, a few jobs already in Eastern Europe around similar types of lay down platforms and defense infrastructure in Eastern Europe as a whole. On the second part around energy in Europe, the answer again is yes. Energy transition and in that effort, not just in continental Europe, but in the UK and in Europe and in Ireland as well is probably at an all-time high with regards to the activities and that continues to be a strong catalyst for growth for us in our European business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thanks guys. I had a couple of quick questions. First on the CMS segment, you talked about the $10 billion of source selection bids out there, does that, is that net of the $4 billion NASA contract? And in general, what are you looking at for the September quarter? Were you looking for some fairly sizeable bookings? And if you could also refresh us on the recompete dynamic over the next 12 months, how much of the CMS business is up for rebid? Steve Demetriou : Let me just start and Bob, you can pick up. So the insource election around the $10 billion is net. So the -- I just want to be clear that the Johnson win is not in our backlog in the third quarter and will be added to the backlog in the fourth quarter. But what we're talking about now moving into the fourth quarter with our bid process is, I already covered several billion of that, being around the cyber and intelligence business, and also some opportunities specifically in our  segment working with the U.S. government. And so we're talking about net around all that. Bob, anything to add? Bob Pragada : No, and may be probably the biggest recompete is NASA Kennedy that is coming up later in the year. We're currently under an extension there. So we like our -- we're confident about our opportunities in both Q4 and Q1. Steve Demetriou : Let me just clarify that. The $10 billion is new business, not rebid so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new awards. Kevin Berryman : New awards insource collection and it's net of NASA, yes. Operator : KeyBanc: Sean Eastman : Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to come back to the investments being made this year. You know, I think it's been clear all through this year that this is somewhat of a major investment year for Jacobs, and it sounded like actually ramped up in the third quarter with sort of incremental investments offsetting that that gain on sale. I just wondered how much of that ramp is Jacobs really getting more aggressive and really bolstering that personnel to support growth versus it ending up costing more than you thought at the start of the year to build up that personnel to support growth? I hope that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fair question. Kevin Berryman : Let me characterize our investment profile. Certainly we entered the year with, as we've talked about over the course of the fiscal year, some pretty strong investment profiles associated with the expected growth. We've actually reduced that a tad in Q3 and Q4 as we've seen a delay in some of the revenue build that we had envisioned happening faster and sooner in the second half of 2022. Now this one particular investment partially offset the WatchGuard benefit. But I think we've continued to be very proactive in sort of supporting people. I know that PA has invested in terms of salary improvements and have increased the pricing associated with efforts in that regard. So effectively, I think it's been broad based that we've continued to be investing against our people and supporting our people, but actually probably faster and in the first half versus the second half, other than this incremental investment we just made because of the WatchGuard benefit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Steve Demetriou : Hey Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Can you give a little more color into the PA Consulting margin? I know you talked about it being pressured by FX and the incremental investments. Can you quantify those investments possibly? And I know you mentioned margins, you returned over 20% in the short term, but you still have confidence in your longer term margin expectations for PA, that sort of 23% flattish as you go ahead over the next several years? Kevin Berryman : Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take a crack at it and then we have Ken here with us and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it to him to see if he has any additional color. But the PA team has been very aggressive in getting new talent into the organization, both at an executive level and at a partner level, which ultimately helps drive and support incremental growth going long-term. They were very successful, especially in Q3 in bringing on board a bevy of talent, which is going to be positioning them for really strong growth going forward in 2023. That all came together, and fundamentally when they brought those folks on board, they're not obviously originally billable from day one and so that will put some pressure on their gross margin. Now it's just about adjusting their hiring going forward, determining how much they need and they'll start to see an improvement back up to the operating profit margin that we discussed in prepared remarks over 20% in the fourth quarter and ultimately beyond into 2023 and beyond and we feel confident on that. Ken? Ken Toombs : Yes, I think you hit it, Kevin. Two things, one was significant amount of senior executive hiring, which came together all at the same time. So we actually had five senior executives join in the same quarter, which had significant cost with it. And then the second part was given the large deals that we have in the pipeline that we historically have not had, we started to ramp up hiring in advance to ensure we can actually service those should we win one or more of them. So we're very confident about the profile going forward and we've obviously watched our recruiting go forward that the pipeline remains very active and strong and we're confident. Operator : RBC Capital Markets.: Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks and good morning. Just kind of the first question is the 50 grants that I think Steve called out earlier related to the IIJA. Anyway you could quantify sort of the dollar amount or how much of that money has sort of come through already? And then just the second question is, maybe a bit more philosophical, but as you mentioned earlier, you are seeing not really any meaningful slowdown in the outlook, but -- and in the past downturns, government's really stepped up with spending across some of your end markets and regions. In the conversations you're having and how much those governments have spent over the last couple of years, what do you think the propensity is there to step up if there is any meaningful slowdown as you look over the next one, two, three years? Thanks. Steve Demetriou : Yes, let me start, Steve here, let me start with it and then I'll turn it over to Bob, but first of all, congratulations. We understand you just had a new baby and wish you success on that big opportunity with your family. So on the grant side, I mentioned 50, there's -- we really, right now we, just some small fees associated with that, but the big opportunity is that we see the first 12 coming to fruition as far as a go decision over the next few weeks, and then those will start to ramp up and there's other grants on the back of that. So we have yet to see the benefit of those, and we're pretty excited about what those will lead to as the procurement cycle progresses on those. Bob why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you handle this? Bob Pragada : Yes. And may be just a add on to that, which would then lead into those growth trajectories that we highlighted in our strategy, which we're gaining more confidence around that specifically in our infrastructure business, in our three major markets which actually four if you count the Middle East, but in the U.S., UK and Australia. On the government's historical reaction to recessionary type periods and then how does that compare to what's happening right now? We actually see that step up as being positive again. We're seeing governments pretty bullish on infrastructure spin, and then in areas where that might be a little bit in debate, those political candidates that seem to have some traction in the marketplace are making very vocal comments about putting more money into major programs in those geographies. So, all-in-all we're feeling very positive about what the future looks like in infrastructure. Kevin Berryman : You also asked about the percent of money that's out there. I think it's over 30% now on the IIJA. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly what the number is right now, but it's over 30%. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Demetriou, I turn the call back over to you for some closing comments. Steve Demetriou : I just want to thank everyone for calling in and we look forward to updating you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-K were filed this morning and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our website which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation materials for information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Now turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Steve will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results and then provide an overview of our software and technology platforms. Bob will then review our performance by line of business and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flows. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with some closing remarks and then we'll open up the call for your questions. In the appendix of this presentation, we provide additional ESG-related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO. Steve Demetriou : Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 business performance and 2023 outlook. As I transition to Jacobs' Executive Chair, I'm excited and confident about the next phase of our strategy boldly moving forward. This strategy continues to unlock and elevate our transformed high-performance culture to capture significant growth opportunities we've identified across climate response, consulting advisory and data solutions, while benefiting from the recurring nature and diversity of our core businesses. From a financial standpoint, we believe the rigorous execution of this strategy will result in enhanced long-term revenue growth and expansion in our profit margin profile. During our last 2 strategies, we maintained a focus on continuing to reshape our business through organic investments, acquisitions and divestitures. And by doing so, we were able to deliver value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. Since we started our journey together in 2016, we intentionally transformed our culture and our brand, grew revenue and expanded profit margins, leading to a total shareholder return of approximately 250%, almost twice the return of the S&P 500. We believe the next phase will be equally as transformative as we maintain our brand promise of challenging today and reinventing tomorrow. Let's now discuss our fourth quarter results. We're seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in our sales pipelines in a number of marquee recent wins which underscores our strategy. During the quarter, net revenue grew 6% year-over-year and grew 11% on a constant currency basis with another quarter of constant currency growth across each line of business. Backlog was up 5% from the prior year's quarter and 8% on a constant currency basis. Within People & Places Solutions, our advanced facilities business again posted double-digit year-over-year top line and operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. And the remaining P&PS units in constant currency also experienced year-over-year growth. During the current quarter, Critical Mission Solutions is beginning to see previously delayed opportunities into the final stages with a major cyber win last week and with another win close to clearing the protest period. PA Consultancy and -- PA Consulting in constant currency continued to show strong Q4 growth with revenue up 9% and backlog up 8% year-over-year. PA successfully won a large multiyear contract with the Ministry of Defense to secure the next-generation soldier in what's proving to be a digitally enabled battlefield. From a full year standpoint, we finished the year within our original guidance range, even when recognizing the translation impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar with double-digit net revenue and operating profit growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to Slide 5. Let me discuss an element of our data solutions accelerator that's housed within the Divergent Solutions business unit which we will formally break out starting in our fiscal first quarter of 2023. We have consolidated the majority of our software and data solutions into a single unit to gain benefits from consistent product management, marketing and research and development. Our data solutions are aligned to 3 high-growth verticals of transportation, water and national security. A competitive differentiation of our vertical software platforms is access and integration of unique data sets and the ability to turn that data into actionable outcomes for our customers. For example, our StreetLight Data platform is a SaaS solution that ingests a variety of mobility data sources into proprietary algorithms that provide data analytics for both traditional transportation clients and giga projects within the broader infrastructure market. Our GeoPod technology creates mapping data for multiple confidential customers as they plan for autonomous driving, precision agriculture and other aerial surveillance requirements. In water, we continue to leverage smart algorithms developed by our domain experts to optimize our clients' operations and maintenance, both AquaDNA and our intelligent and our intelligent O&M solution can save 10% to 30% in energy use for wastewater treatment. We continue to expand our water solutions across our clients' assets life cycle. From a national security standpoint, our extreme search solution has proprietary algorithms and compute ability that can rapidly search large volumes of real-time or log data. One critical use case is quickly finding indicators of compromise to prevent cyber breaches. Given the significant amount of data that will be created and utilized in IT and OT environments, we believe the applications of these types of solutions are in the early stages of decades of robust growth. Before I turn the call over to Bob, first, I'd like to thank the amazing people at Jacobs for living our values and progressing our culture over the last several years. Every single day, Jacobs is providing critical solutions globally. For example, most recently, supporting NASA for the Artemis launch to the move or consulting on green hydrogen solutions for sovereign nations, delivering world-scale biotechnology manufacturing solutions, remediating harmful PaaS chemicals from our water or planning autonomous transportation for the city of the future. It is truly our people that make Jacobs a company like no other. Now, I'd like to congratulate Bob on his appointment to CEO and say that I'm excited to have experienced a dynamic leader who brings decades of industry domain knowledge and a proven track record to lead our boldly moving forward strategy into the future. Bob? Bob Pragada : Thank you, Steve. I'm honored to take on the role of CEO early next year and advance the exciting work underway to further diversify our capabilities and offerings, increasing opportunities and value for our people, our clients and our shareholders alike. I want to thank Steve for his partnership and guidance over the past 7 years. He is an incredible leader who inspires all around and will leave a tremendous legacy at Jacobs. I'll begin on Slide 6, discussing our People & Places Solutions business where we achieved strong top and bottom line results with backlog up 8% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency. With critical infrastructure priorities on the rise over the past year, our quarter results show that we've been successful in converting opportunity into accessible backlog. This success is underpinned by our global workforce which expanded 12% this year. For example, in FY '22, our advanced facilities operating -- advanced facilities unit operating profit grew by well over 25% and on a constant currency basis due to our scalable multi-geography delivery teams. Overall, we see our quarter results as Jacobs strategy in action. It's proof that Jacobs deep domain expertise can transform client outcomes, replacing conventional infrastructure delivery with modern data-enabled solutions. I'll discuss results under the themes of supply chain diversification, infrastructure modernization and climate response. Across these themes, I'll highlight how our technology and data solutions enable our success. First, supply chain diversification has led to expanded delivery for clients with long-term investment profiles that continue through changing economic conditions. In life sciences, our clients are in the middle of a generational expansion of therapeutics and vaccines as well as advanced health care and [indiscernible] on a global scale. Our confidential clients can accelerate production capacity for life-saving medicines for the most widespread chronic diseases by leveraging Jacobs' expertise in digital design to optimize delivery across multiple large-scale biotech campuses. We are also advising and delivering predictive analytics for point-of-care treatment resulting in improved outcomes for a growing and aging population with clients such as New South Wales Health Infrastructure in Australia, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. Jacobs remains uniquely positioned across the entire electric vehicle ecosystem to address all aspects of this rapidly expanding market from manufacturing capacity to EV charging infrastructure to advanced mobility implementation. With favorable tailwinds and expanding list of automobile and EV manufacturing clients are seeking Jacobs' leading support to develop sustainable production capacity. Moving to climate response. Global demand for affordable green energy led to an increase of over 33% in bookings with wins across multiple geographies, including the U.K.'s National Grid, U.S. Department of Energy, [indiscernible] of Energy in Korea where we're developing a new green hydrogen production and import facility. In the U.S., IIJA supported pipeline is building momentum and projects are moving through the sales cycle into delivery. For example, there is a broad focus on transportation decarbonization with support for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, NEVI, across multiple DOTs. Charging infrastructure for the navy and in multiple states under the low or no emission vehicle brand programs. For the environment agency in the U.K., we are living a digital proof of concept, leveraging spatial, predictive analytics to avoid extensive damage in human casualties due to flooding and other climate-driven disasters. At the same time, national highways chose us to streamline their complex data landscape, thanks to our cyber and digital capabilities, partnered with PA Consulting. With StreetLight Data's multimodal transportation insights platform, we've expanded opportunities for both traditional public sector transportation clients and new private sector clients to prioritize marketing and real estate investments. Water sector clients are investing in our new technologies, such as AquaDNA, Dragonfly and intelligent operations maintenance. These integrated AI and ML cloud-based technologies enable clients to provide reliable clean water access for all communities, leading to expanded services this quarter from wins in Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, the U.K., Singapore and Australia. These innovative platforms are driving the new standard for asset management. In Hawaii, we are delivering a 20-year installation development plan to address climate adaptation for the joint base Pearl Harbor hiccup. Under infrastructure modernization, mega program delivery trends continue as clients look for more efficient ways to deliver sustainable, liveable places. In Scandinavia, we are designing the Nord Aven tunnel to across the harbor in Copenhagen, Denmark. And in Toronto, MetroLinx recently awarded Jacobs a multiyear extension to support their $85 billion regional transit expansion. In summary, People & Places Solutions is positioned for long-term growth as evidenced by strong performance across all geographies and client segments. Clients are continuing to partner with Jacobs to deliver transformative infrastructure, advanced manufacturing expansion and energy security projects with sustainable lasting outcomes. Moving to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions line of business. CMS delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter with backlog remaining strong at $10.6 billion, flat year-over-year, with gross profit in backlog was up 10% year-over-year and 12% in constant currency. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating diligent revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. CMS's service and solutions offerings are delivered across our core customer markets : space, cyber, intelligence, defense and energy. And we continue to see strong demand for our solutions across all of them. In space, Jacobs is a critical prime contractor to NASA's Artemis program, including being the key integrator of the successful uncrewed launch last week of the space launch system rocket in preparation to spend U.S. astronauts back to the moon by 2025. The Artemis 1 launch is historic and we are proud of Jacob's role in the mission. Also, we were awarded contracts by the Scottish rocket manufacturer and small sat launch service provider, Urbex, to help them build and operate a vertical launch site for satellites in the U.K. Several trends in other Jacobs key markets that we are seeing contributing to our continued growth include Zero Trust Architecture [ph], hypersonics and modular reactors. Beginning with Zero Trust Architecture or ZTA. White House Executive Order, 1028, mandates, adoption of ZTA cybersecurity models across the federal government. Importantly, ZTA requires continuous verification of identity as movers as users move laterally through network systems. Jacobs' cyber intelligence team which is now part of our new Divergent Solution operating unit is the program manager for one of the intelligence communities largest [indiscernible], responsible for identity, credential and access management, ICAM. ICAM is a critical architectural component of effective Zero Trust models and Jacobs' technical leadership in this area positions us to help clients across the federal government, meet the White House executive order. Our cyber and intelligence business unit has a significant pipeline of opportunities requiring ZTA adoption. In Q4, our cyber intelligence team also won several new non-ZTA contracts, including an agile software development and sustainment contract or a classified contract and one assisting the Navy to advance their radar sensing capability at the Naval Research Laboratory. We also recently cleared the protest period for a $470 million 6-year IDIQ, providing identity intelligence support to the DoD which is not yet reflected in backlog. Moving on to hypersonics. With advances in hypersonic missile technology by China and Russia, the U.S. Department of Defense is developing missile defenses to defend against hypersonic weapons and other emergent threats. Because hypersonic weapons fly at speeds of at least MAC 5, roughly 1 mile per second and can maneuver in route to their target, they are more difficult to defend against. Jacobs has decades of experience supporting the U.S. Air Force and NASA and has positioned itself as a leader in hypersonic solutions. In last quarter, Jacobs was awarded a 5-year $100 million IDIQ to help the U.S. Navy design and operate an underwater launch test system with the Naval Surface Warfare [ph]. The contract also covers modernization, design, fabrication and operation support for an in-air launch testing platform at the Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake in California. Finally, demand for modular reactors. Nuclear power is coming into favor as a clean energy alternative to fossil fuels. For countries to achieve their next zero carbon emission goals and ensure energy independence and security, leaders are realizing they need to include the always-on emission-free generation. Small modular reactors or SMRs are reactors with electric generating capacity of 300 megawatts versus traditional large reactors with generating capacity of 1 gigawatt or more. SMRs have numerous benefits, including lower initial capital investment, greater scalability through factory manufacturing processes, greater siding flexibility on smaller grid and isolated areas and greater energy efficiency. In the U.K., we are delivering engineering and technical services to the Rolls-Royce SMR program and licensing advice to GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy as they look to enter the U.K. market. There's also increased interest in new advanced modular reactors or AMRs, that can be designed to provide specific benefits such as producing high heat for green hydrogen. We are supporting multiple AMR vendors in the U.S. and U.K. Jacobs is a leader in global nuclear solutions, building on our long legacy of organic capabilities and acquisitions of CH2M and Wood Nuclear. In summary, we continue to see solid revenue visibility for our solutions in FY '23 and with approximately 85% of CMS's portfolio, consisting of large enterprise contracts with durations greater than 4 years and 88% from federal level government funding. We are also pleased with the Government Accountability Office's recent guidance to have the U.S. Air Force re-evaluate proposals for its large Integrated Support Contract, ISC 2.0, in support of a new source selection decision. And therefore, this remains in our pipeline as a potential multibillion-dollar opportunity. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 24-month qualified new business at approximately $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection with an expanding margin profile. Moving on to PA Consulting on Slide 8. PA continues to deliver its strategy and is securing exciting and enduring work. PA's deep insight lasting relationships and ability to assist clients through economic cycles is also generating consistent demand for its expertise. This quarter, PA was awarded marquee wins across the key markets. As Steve mentioned, in the U.K. public sector, where it's a major player, PA was selected as the lead systems integrator for a multiyear contract providing next-generation solutions to counter threats posed by radio-controlled improvised explosive devices, IED. The contract leverages PA's extensive experience in major program delivery as they lead the delivery consortium, Team Protect. PA was also appointed to oversee the delivery of a once-in-a-generation program for social care reform in the U.K., further cementing its position in government and public sector. Transport continues to be a major focus with additional awards won at Schipol Airport in the Netherlands, where the joint capabilities of Jacobs and PA continue to create further opportunities to include boardroom advisory and digitalization of airside operations. The Jacobs PA partnership is strongly positioned to continue to capitalize on substantial market opportunities. Jacobs' global footprint and broad-based domain expertise together with PA's high-end digital consulting, creates a compelling value proposition in distinct areas of opportunity. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. And turning to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 8% year-over-year and net revenue was 6% and up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. All lines of businesses grew fourth quarter revenue over 9% versus a year ago in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% and improved slightly from the third quarter but was approximately down 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by : one, our CMS line of business due to the newly ramped remediation contract; and two, investments in incremental employees in TA in advance of the large wins such as the U.K. MOD award that will ramp over the coming months. We expect gross margins to modestly improve from Q4 levels during fiscal 2023, driven by recent wins in cyber, favorable revenue mix, recent wins in PA Consulting and continued strong performance in our People & Places Solutions business. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.2%, down 40 basis points from Q3 and down 200 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from lower labor expenses as we managed our cost structure. We are targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $309 million and was mainly impacted by $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $14 million with over half associated with integration costs of acquisitions. And finally, a positive benefit from third-party recoveries of $27 million pretax which we excluded from our adjusted results. Adjusted operating profit was therefore $347 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, it was up 19% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the moving parts later when reviewing the line of business performance. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.75 per share and included a $0.16 benefit from the third-party recovery receivable, a $0.12 benefit to align to our effective adjusted tax rate, offset by a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.06 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.80, up 14% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. Jacobs' consolidated Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $350 million and was up 13% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year. Finally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, backlog was impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar at year-end compared to the end of the third quarter. As an example, the dollar strengthened 8% versus the pound sterling from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4. As a result, on a constant currency basis, backlog was flat sequentially. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.94x with our gross margin book-to-bill at 1.05x given a higher margin profile within backlog on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching Kennedy NASA rebid as backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded. Now moving to Slide 10 for a brief recap of our full year 2022 performance. Fiscal [ph] year gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 10% in constant currency. On a reported basis, we expect fiscal 2023 revenue growth in the mid-single digits and high single digits on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating profit was $918 million, up significantly year-over-year, driven by a material decrease in onetime items related to transaction and restructuring as well as solid underlying constant currency growth in the business. GAAP EPS was $4.98 and adjusted EPS was $6.93, up 10% year-over-year and up 13% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit grew 10.6% and was up 13% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins expanded nearly 30 basis points to 10.4%, driven by revenue mix benefits and lower support costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 10% and up 12% in constant currency. As a percentage of net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%, up 20 basis points from fiscal 2021. We expect modest adjusted operating profit margin expansion in fiscal 2023, driven by a combination of a higher margin revenue mix and lower employee-related costs. However, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be flat year-over-year as other income will be burdened primarily by unfavorable pension costs driven by the higher interest rate environment. On a trailing 12-month basis, book-to-bill was 0.97x and gross margin book-to-bill was over 1 at 1.05. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q4 performance and Slide 12 for full year performance. Starting with CMS; Q4 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 12% in constant currency, [indiscernible] contributed approximately $22 million to the fourth quarter revenue. Fiscal 2020 revenue on a reported and constant currency basis grew 3% as the part of the year -- as the first part of the year did not benefit from the ramp of the Idaho nuclear remediation win. Black Links contributed $50 million in revenue for fiscal year 2022. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the CMS business and higher double-digit growth in our Divergent Solutions unit. Q4 CMS operating profit was $95 million, down 17% year-over-year and down 14% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margins as a result, were down 220 basis points year-over-year to 6.9%. Consistent with our previous outlook, Q4 operating margin percentage were impacted by a rate true-up in our cyber and intelligence business. The rate true-up was related to higher G&A over the course of the year given the slower ramp in the business during the continuing resolution. Looking forward, we have successfully been awarded a large new classified cyber win that was previously delayed during the continuing resolution, indicating developing momentum. Looking into fiscal 2023, we expect approximately 75 basis points of sequential operating margin expansion in Q1 and driven by immediate rebound from the onetime rate true-up in Q4. We're also targeting further margin expansion through fiscal 2023 as we win and ramp new higher-margin awards. Moving to People & Places Solutions. Overall, P&PS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 net revenue was up 6% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. On a constant currency basis, each P&PS region demonstrated net revenue growth. And for the full year, P&PS grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Looking deeper into our business units, our advanced facilities unit which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and EV supply chains, posted another stellar quarter of double-digit revenue operating profit growth. For the fiscal year, the business grew operating profit well north of 25%. We expect our advanced facilities growth rate to continue to remain robust during the fiscal year 2023 at approximately 10% despite the strong year-over-year comparisons. The P&PS International business, Q4 revenue and operating profit was essentially flat year-over-year on a reported basis but grew double digits in constant currency. For the full year, international operating profit was up 10% year-over-year in constant currency. Our international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during fiscal 2023, resulting in flattish reported revenue growth but is poised for full year growth on a constant currency basis. Total P&PS Q4 gross profit and margins were up year-over-year with Q4 operating profit up 31% and operating profit as a percentage of net revenue up 275 basis points, driven by revenue growth and mix as well as lower labor costs during the quarter. Full year People & Places operating profit was up 5.5% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency, with operating margins of 13.2%, up 20 basis points versus a year ago. In terms of PA's performance, PA Q4 revenue declined 7.7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars but it grew 9% in pound sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 19.4% during the quarter due to continued lower utilization and investments in pipeline pursuits. As Bob mentioned, PA Consulting has been successful winning the large [indiscernible] award with the MOD for which we expect to show benefit later in 2023. We continue to target double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis with operating margins returning to above 20% throughout 2023, driven by improved utilization. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $28 million, down year-over-year as we benefited from lower incentive costs and to a lesser extent, from a positive currency impact on our supported costs and other benefits. We now expect non-allocated costs -- corporate costs to be $190 million to $210 million for fiscal 2023 which is slightly higher than fiscal year 2022 as we expect higher incentive costs on a year-over-year basis. Now turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow generation continued to be strong. Free cash flow was $230 million in Q4 and included $12 million related to transaction costs and other items. On a full year basis, reported cash flow was $347 million but included the net $475 million of cash outflows related to the previously announced Inpex settlement, the first $55 million repayment of Cares Act payroll tax deferral and a net $4 million cash benefit related to other items. Excluding these items, free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 97% for the year. For fiscal 2023, we expect 2 items to impact cash flow an approximately net $15 million of further cash outflows from restructuring, transaction and other related costs. And a final repayment of $60 million of Cares Act payroll tax deferral benefits. Excluding these items, we anticipate again to achieve 100% free cash flow to adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2023. We are also continuing to evaluate further real estate opportunities given our developing insight as to our longer-term needs given the hybrid work environment and we will update on our Q1 earnings call with further developments in this regard. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $31 million of shares. And for the full year, we repurchased $282 million. After September, we have continued to be actively purchasing shares with approximately $135 million repurchased as of last week. As we have said before, we will remain agile and opportunistic and repurchasing shares as we see disruption in the market. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.4 billion, resulting in a $2.3 billion of net debt. Our Q4 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.6x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q4, approximately 60% of our debt is like the floating rate debt. And as a result, we are expecting incremental interest costs going forward which we have incorporated into our outlook. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.6%. Early in the fourth quarter, we entered into a notional $500 million interest rate lock at a rate of 2.7% as related to a planned future fixed rate issuance. The mark-to-market benefit from the in the money interest rate lock is currently recognized in other comprehensive income but will offset interest expense of our future expected fixed income issuance. Also, in early October, we redeemed $481 million of private notes at par. In the appendix on Slide 16 of the presentation, we included additional detail related to our debt maturities and interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which we announced at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and paid on October 28. I will now turn the call back over to Bob. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 14. As we discussed throughout our remarks, through proactive portfolio management, we have aligned our business to sectors that continue to demonstrate robust growth through multiple economic scenarios. We continue to enhance our overall growth rate with our climate response consulting and advisory and data solutions strategic accelerators. Given the volatility of FX rates, we are providing our outlook under 2 FX scenarios : one, an outlook based on constant currency which provides greater insight of underlying business performance; and two, an outlook based on more recent FX rates. Although we transact in multiple currencies, one example for reference is the pound sterling. The full year 2022 average conversion rate for the pound sterling was $1.28 compared to $1.15 early November 2022. As footnote in our earnings release and investor presentation, based on fiscal 2022 average rate, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.465 billion to $1.545 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.90, up 10% and 12%, respectively, at the midpoint. Based on rates in early November, our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA is $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.20 to $7.50, both up 6% at the midpoint. On a net revenue basis, the difference between these 2 scenarios is approximately $430 million. Looking beyond fiscal 2023, we remain confident achieving double-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, consistent with our strategic plan. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Bert Subin : Congratulations to both Bob and Steve. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Bert. Bert Subin : Bob, maybe to start out with you. You ended there talking about feeling pretty confident in sort of double-digit growth. You guys have previously provided your fiscal '24 targets by segment on both a margin and a sales basis. If we exclude the impact of FX, do you still remain confident in those bands across each segment? Bob Pragada : We do, Bert. The tailwinds that we see in the markets that we're certain, we stand by those commitments that we made on the -- in the '24 strategic line. Bert Subin : Okay. And just a quick follow-up in terms of thinking about P&PS. It performed really well during the quarter and you made some pretty positive comments on what you're seeing on the advanced facility side. Should we expect any sort of incremental softness just as your semiconductor clients slow their spend? And in terms of the infrastructure side of things in the segment, are you starting to see a material uptick from IIJA? Or is that just the plan as you sort of -- as you progress through '23? Bob Pragada : Sure. So let me answer the first question. On the semiconductor spend, the industry as a whole from a demand standpoint is in a bit of soft period. The client base and the geographies that we're working in, we have not seen that. And so the front end, the design work, the momentum that we've seen over the course of the last 6 to 8 quarters, that has not slowed at all. And so we're feeling comfortable about where we sit in that ecosystem of consultants to that, specifically with our client base. So we're positive on that front. On IIJA, we actually -- we are seeing those projects that we have been tracking through the development of both grants as well as the formula funding coming to fruition. Probably the bigger element to that is that the release of those monies is actually unlocking the base funding that the states previously, specifically during COVID, had locked up not knowing kind of what the future looks like. So overall, the pipeline is up on the U.S. basis and infrastructure. Our pipeline is up of 4% to 5% -- I'm sorry, 5% without IIJA, 18% with IIJA from a pipeline standpoint; so we are seeing that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Louie Dipalma : I would like to echo congrats to Steve and Bob on your new roles. Bob Pragada : Thank you. Steve Demetriou : Thanks, Louie Louie Dipalma : For Steve and Bob, you referenced several cyber intel awards associated with your KeyW and Buffalo Group acquisitions. Are these awards margin accretive? And should the Critical Missions operating profit in 2023 be back to the 2021 level? Bob Pragada : So both question, Louie, the answer is yes. The award -- the 2 awards that Steve and I specifically spoke about are coming in through those 2 at a portals or through those relationships that we had and the acquisitions that we made during that period. So we are seeing that. They are margin accretive. This -- the flip side of this is that these are awards that we had expected in previous quarters. And we talked about it a lot in previous earnings calls, that the knock-on effect of the CR has now had an effect on kind of when those things start. So we do see margins going up and these are serving as catalysts for that too. Kevin Berryman : The other thing, Louis, though, '21 was the high point. So I would say that the underlying business is returning. We had some other events in 2021 that accelerated the margin a little bit higher. We had some one-off closeouts which were pretty strong. But I think in 2023, the underlying is getting back up well into the 8s, I would say. So maybe not all the way back up to the -- I think we were at 9% in 2021 but we're going to get underlying to be quite consistent with 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Maybe for Bob or Kevin, you call out in your CMS the improved in -- the book-to-bill but also the gross margin book-to-bill. Maybe you can talk a little bit about P&PS and PAC in a similar light? Or do you want to give out the actual numbers? And how much is -- as you look into timing of awards and ramp up and some of the utilization issues that you or fit in '22, is that more of mid- to later '23 to show some much better for FX better growth as we move towards the end of '23? Kevin Berryman : I'm sorry, Mike, you were breaking up. I was having trouble understanding you. I apologize. Michael Dudas : So first, Kevin, I'm just talking about like your book to bill, you talked about the CMS gross margin book-to-bill. Maybe you could highlight in PP&S [ph] and PAC similar just the observations relative to what's in backlog, what do you anticipate in new orders? And maybe the timing of those orders relative to your outlook for 2023? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Okay, got that. All right. Thanks, Mike. So look, People & Places continue to show good margin profile and backlog as well. So I think that's obviously, a very critical part of our strategy. When we think about delivering more value-added solutions, the margin is it's got to come with it. So the backlog margin profile is better in People & Places and also it's better in PA as well. And the dynamic of PA relative to the Q4 number really was effectively the continued utilization we -- to get up to around 20%. We fell a little bit short of that but it's continuing to improve and we would expect that we'll get back up to those more normalized levels that we saw over the course of '22 -- early '22 relative to the margin profile there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Congrats, Bob. And congrats, Steve. I guess first question, over the long term, can you just talk to -- on CMS, can you talk to the strategic importance of CMS to the portfolio? And if margins continue to sort of underperform, would you consider sort of other options? Or do you see a path over time to get to, I think, the margin improvement targets that you laid out in the 2024 targets like how long before we get there? And then my second question, Kevin, the cash flow generation that you're implying for 2023, it's quite strong and your balance sheet is in good shape. So just trying to understand how you're looking at -- how you're thinking about the M&A profile versus share repurchase? Steve Demetriou : Yes. It's Steve here, Jamie. So I can speak for both the Board and management around that question is we, first of all, the whole strategy around Divergent Solutions was to break out the elements of CMS that are highly consistent, especially with the data solutions side of our 3 accelerators; and so obviously [indiscernible]. We're excited about that. That's where we're really going to see accelerated margin growth, especially with these recent cyber wins that we've talked about but also across the entire platform. And then when you get into the remaining CMS business, just as an example, nuclear most recently has been surging with regard to becoming a clean energy transition solution. And as you know, we're a major player in nuclear, not just in the remediation side but the new build side, especially in the new technology of advanced small modular reactors. So, we're excited about the future of those and we'll continue to monitor the entire company as far as fit, et cetera, long term, as we've done in the past. And I mentioned in my remarks but we're very optimistic about the CMS business as we move into 2023. Kevin Berryman : Jamie, about the cash flow. Yes, we feel continued strength in our cash flow is expected over the course of 2023, that provides us degrees of freedom, to your point, about how we will deploy that additional capital that's available. So look, I think we continue to monitor the M&A front, I think we were very clear during our strategy as to where we would probably be focusing those ideas and thoughts relative to the 3 accelerators that we outlined in strategy and we're continuing to monitor those opportunities. There are things out there that are being evaluated obviously. Got to result in bid equalling ask where we feel like we can add an ROIC and a return profile to our shareholders that are appropriate; and so we'll see how that plays out. Of course, we also talked about during the prepared remarks, the proactive stance that we've been taking on the share repurchases. And so we feel like we're well positioned to be able to act when appropriate relative to a potential strategic opportunity and/or do share buybacks when there's market dislocation. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Steve and Bob, congratulations. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Bob, I'm wondering if you could just talk about your strategic priorities over the next 3 to 5 years just from a high-level standpoint, anything that we should be keeping in mind? Bob Pragada : Yes, Jerry, obviously something that we've been -- I've been thinking about a lot. Maybe a couple of precursor comments and then directly to the question. The precursor comment was and I tried to infer -- say it almost explicitly, the way Steve has run the executive team and the company has been really very inclusive. And so when you look at our strategy, not just the one that we released last March but even in '16 and '19, that's a strategy that was developed by all of us as a team. So it's not me coming in with a new strategy. I feel very, very bought in and tied to with the strategy that we have. So the first big area around our clients. The accelerators that we have are the national and global priorities that are driving the world. And so that's going to continue to drive our business as we come up with more technology-enabled and client-driven type solutions. The second is around investments in our people. Our people have delivered time and time again over decades. But if you look at the profile of our people, although our business is weighted towards the U.S., our -- we have about a 55-45 U.S. versus outside of the U.S. profile of our people, really driven around that global delivery that we've counted for so long. And so those investments and continued driving around inclusion and diversity and sourcing talent from all over the world is going to be really, really important. And the last piece I'd say is around resilience. Resilience in our business with regards to our systems and how we run the company but also simplicity of our business. We've diversified the business and we've tried to have direct access to our clients. But making that -- having simplicity in the forefront is really key as well. So kind of segregated in those 3 main areas. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher : So we have about a month left on the current continuing resolution. So I'm curious what you've baked into the guidance for continuing resolution across your segments? And then I guess there's clearly a lot of cross currents in the global economy at the moment. What do you see as any other big risk to your guidance? And maybe what contingency plans do you have in process to address those risks? Kevin Berryman : Maybe I'll make some comments first and then have my partners here add any additional commentary to think appropriate. So look, I think we feel pretty good about the continuing resolution, given the makeup of the Senate and the House and how that's going to be coming together. And we just had a really deep dive review from a government relations team feeling pretty good about how things are going to play out over the course of this quarter. So we don't believe that there is going to be a continuing resolution that extends well into 2023. We're hoping that that will become resolved near the end of the calendar year. So I think that we're already starting to see, regardless of that continuing resolution, some momentum building relative to what Bob alluded to as -- and I made some comments on in terms of the cyber and intelligence business starting to get unlocked relative to bids being awarded and whatnot. So, we think that the combination of those 2 things are embedded into our guidance. And I feel -- we feel pretty good about it actually. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Steve and Bob, congratulations. Bob Pragada : Thanks, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : So you mentioned you're still targeting double-digit constant currency revenue growth for PA Consulting but I think constant currency Q4 was in the high single digits. Does the recent large contract when you mentioned to give you the visibility you need to be confident around constant currency double-digit growth for FY '23 despite U.K. economic concerns? And does margin normalize higher quite significantly impair as revenue ramps up towards that 20% goal that you've given us before? Or should we think about a gradual margin ramp-up from here in PA? Kevin Berryman : So if you look at the ramp-up of the year, certainly, that large win is part of the equation but it ends up kind of building over the course of 2023. And so it's less of a direct impact in 2023. What we do believe and our view on the U.K. is that we've -- I guess, I would characterize us as being underwhelmed by the level of activity -- productive activity in the government which has actually put some pressure in the short term relative to the U.K. But with the recent budget that was announced and some of the activity of our clients is starting to look much better. So we're feeling like longer-term into 2023, that we're going to start to see some incremental momentum versus kind of what we've been seeing over the last, I'm going to call it, 6 months. So, we're feeling that things will start to improve. The other thing is that the backlog and the pipeline of PA, we're seeing no challenges associated with that. Seeing a little bit of the burn profile, as mentioned just earlier relative to the, I'm going to call it, the unknown relative to the U.K. government but we're starting to see that instance in that issue going away as we speak. Bob Pragada : Just to put some -- just to quantify Kevin's last comment, the pipeline growth in PA alone this quarter was 52% year-on-year. So the pipeline continues to grow. And the way we evaluate pipeline within the PA world, since it's a pure-play consultancy, are projects, programs, engagements where we already actually have started a bit of them, too. So these are promising as well as the programs that were announced in the budget that Kevin referenced. Other programs that PA and Jacobs are actually partnered on right now. So that's -- hence, the bit of positivity there along with some realism of the last couple of months on what's gone down. Operator : Your next question is from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : I just wanted to confirm whether we should still anticipate Divergent Solutions to be broken out as a new segment starting in the first quarter? And perhaps in advance of that, just trying to get a rough expectation as to what that business line is contributing to this initial fiscal '23 outlook maybe from an EBIT perspective? Kevin Berryman : So the business is effectively operational right now and we will be executing against the promise that we made relative to reporting that as a separate segment on the financials. So Sean, we're on track to do that. So I think that we'll -- we're going to provide additional color commentary because we're still working through all of the accounting mechanisms to make sure that our systems are reporting accurately and the controls are in place because it's a pretty large change. But I will tell you that it will be one of the highest growth areas that we're expecting in the company for 2023. And effectively, it will be a margin profile that will be growing substantially over time, a little bit lower in 2023 than what we expect at the exit rate. But at the end of the day, we'll provide a lot of details in Q1 relative to that. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Chad Dillard : So I was hoping you guys could expand on just like the opportunities for increased wallet share on infrastructure work? Maybe you can weave in some of the recent acquisitions and some of your expanded digital capabilities and just talk about just what sort of margin we should be kind of thinking about for these new projects? Bob Pragada : Sorry, Chad, you were a little broken up there. Can you repeat the question? Chad Dillard : Yes. So can you just expand on like what sort of incremental wallet share opportunities you have in your infrastructure business. And maybe weave into it as some of the recent acquisitions that you've had in terms of your expanded digital capabilities? Bob Pragada : Okay. Infrastructure, was that -- that part? Chad Dillard : Correct. Bob Pragada : Yes, got it. Okay. In infrastructure, the opportunities continue to grow. I'd say broadly driven mostly in the U.S. but we're seeing this and Steve talked about the international -- I'm sorry, Kevin talked about the international business but heavily geared towards transportation and water with a growing profile around energy transition. And so those are kind of the 3 main areas. Environmental continues to be robust. So, we see those -- I mean, the pipeline growth I talked about before, has been really, really strong. On the acquisitions, that's a business where StreetLight Data probably was the last -- the one that we did, it was a smaller acquisition. And we are immediately seeing fit that we had anticipated in the deal kind of thesis around StreetLight all around that data-enabled [indiscernible] data in driving a different type of solution for our clients. They had clients before, predominantly the state DOTs in the U.S. but that's been expanded with our relationships. And then we're seeing private sector utilization too, as private sector firms have looked at the use of data in order to cite different investments that they're making from a capital project perspective; so very positive news on that front. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : I believe you're guiding 2023 growth mid-single digit or high single digit on a constant currency basis. You're citing some really robust sectors, EVs, life sciences, reshoring, hydrogen, autonomous. So what isn't growing that fast in the portfolio? Does it just take longer? Is there momentum the project [indiscernible]? Does organic growth profile actually reaccelerate further in 2024? And in 2024, you get just better operating leverage off that type of growth with higher utilization? How should we kind of think about that as we move forward into 2024? Kevin Berryman : Well, look, if you think about the high single digits in terms of constant currency growth, I think that's pretty strong actually. And look, I think that the bottom line is -- for example, Bob just quoted the pipeline growth in the United States of near 20% kind of growth in the pipeline. It just takes a while for that to kind of [indiscernible] be won and then start to build the burn associated with it. So you're relying on your clients as much as you are anything else to be able to execute against that. And they're sometimes not as quick as we are ready to execute. So look, I think it's a growing momentum. And I think we're being prudent assuming how that's going to build over the course of 2023. Bob Pragada : If I could add, Kevin, while we're adding on those end markets that do have a quicker burn profile, all 3 of us today talked about the growth in advanced facilities where that has been a catalyst for growth. So though the top line might be in those numbers that were quoted, I did think -- we did say on a constant currency basis, our bottom line growth would be double digits. So I think there's some real optimism in the portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Congrats, Steve and Bob. Steve Demetriou : Thanks. Gautam Khanna : I wanted -- just following up on some of the recent questions. Can you frame recompete exposure in fiscal '23 and maybe even opine on at that CMS and wherever you think it's noteworthy percentage of sales up for rebid? Or if there are any lumpy individual contracts that are up and maybe the timing of those? Bob Pragada : Sure. I'd say that the recompete exposure in '23 is moderate to low. We -- it's predominantly in our CMS business and we've already gotten some real positive indications of some of those larger ones that are -- I say there's only a couple. So I would not characterize that as a big exposure in '23. Kevin Berryman : The only one that -- we've called out the one at Kennedy which is -- that's a big one but we feel good about our position there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy Wittmann : Great. And Bob, congratulations on promotion, Steve yours as well. Kevin, I just thought maybe a question for you. I wanted to understand the fourth quarter results here a little bit clear. I guess your corporate unallocated expense was $28 million. I think you were kind of suggesting it was going to be higher than that for the quarter as well as your guidance for '23 is implying a run rate of about $50 million per quarter. So I was wondering, I guess you called out incentive comp. You also mentioned an FX impact, keeping that number down this quarter. So could you comment on the size of the FX impact? And was that -- what the nature of that was? Is that like a noncash accounting thing for some hedges that you had in FX? Or was there something else in there that was driving that benefit to the quarter? Kevin Berryman : No. Look, the dynamic -- I don't have the FX dynamic specifically outlined but certainly, we can follow up with you, Andy, on that. But if you think about it, our corporate-related costs that support costs are embedded around the world. And so effectively, if you have U.K., for example, corporate-related costs, they're getting translated into a lower rate effectively. So the value of those costs go down and that effectively had some benefits associated with us because it's all -- it's effectively corporate costs and not corporate revenue. So if you get the difference between the two. And then look, we have known that the constant currency dynamic was still robust but we knew that the reported currency continued to be a challenge and we are very proactive in terms of taking steps to ensure that we reach the commitment levels that we had established for the company. So we pay attention to this and very, very proactive in terms of the management of our cost structure during Q4. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Sabahat Khan : Just, I guess, the earlier commentary around how much the pipeline is building up, including the IIJA. Kind of if we think about that bill and the other ones starting to flow through, maybe some offset with pricing maybe moderating, how do you expect, I guess, backlog just to trend over the course of the next 12 to 18 months? I guess is it fair to assume with that extra government funding it could continue to grow? I just want to understand what you have embedded in the guidance that you've provided today? Kevin Berryman : Well, I will tell you that, as you may know, backlog is one of our incentive metrics. And I can assure you that our incentives are based on backlog continuing to show very strong growth year-over-year. Bob Pragada : Maybe I could you like to add one more thing, just on what drives backlog which is sales at, we've put a tremendous amount we've been a sales-driven company for since inception. I think Dr. Jacob started that mantra. Our sales-driven growth and the investments we've made, [indiscernible] now our new Chief Growth Officer as well, has been very, very specific as our portfolio has developed over the period -- this most recent period of time. So we're putting the full force effort on our sales effort as the pipeline continues to grow; so timing is good. Operator : There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Bob Pragada. Bob Pragada : Yes. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. I'm looking forward to providing further updates on our progress and upcoming events and calls. Have a -- for those of you in the U.S., have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Steve Demetriou : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Solutions Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Jonathan Doros, Investor Relations, you may begin. Jonathan Doros : Thank you. Good morning to all. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a copy of the slide presentation on our Web site, which we will reference during the call. I'd like to refer you to Slide 2 of this presentation materials for information about our forward-looking statements and non- GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined today by our incoming CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by summarizing highlights from our first quarter results, discuss our commitment to sustainability and then provide an update on our strategy. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. In the appendix of the presentation, we provide additional ESG related information, including examples of our leading ESG solutions. With that, I'll now pass it on to Bob Borgata, CEO. Bob Pragada : Thank you, John. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Starting on Slide 4. I'd like to welcome to the call, Claudia Jaramillo, who is currently our Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development. We recently announced her transition to CFO later this year. I'm excited to now lead Jacobs as CEO. Over the last several years, we have repositioned the company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio and capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent sectors. At this juncture in our strategy, strong execution and focus is pivotal to our success. There are three key priorities, first, we will maintain our inclusive and inspirational culture that fosters the creativity needed to live by our mission, challenges today reinventing tomorrow. Second, we will focus on driving a higher structural growth rate across our core sectors by executing against the three needle moving growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory across the entire organization and sectors we serve. While we are in a leading position to capitalize on the mega trends and structural tailwinds, our relentless focus on long term client relationships is driving sustained growth. Third, we will deliver long term returns for our shareholders by driving further operational discipline across the business to accelerate cash flow generation with disciplined capital allocation. From a financial standpoint, our underlying business remains strong. Our People & Places Solutions line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 8% year-over-year, 13% in constant currency, operating profit up 20% year-over-year, 28% in constant currency, and we continue to gain market share in both the global critical infrastructure and advanced facility sectors. In CMS, we continue to deliver a strong base of recurring revenue with a growing new business pipeline. We anticipate strong tailwinds and backlog growth with CMS moving forward. PA Consulting experienced lower than expected utilization, but we continue to experience double digit top line and backlog growth. We are seeing strong demand with robust opportunities in PA sales pipeline. The number of recent wins underscores our strategy and demonstrates our move of the value chain with our clients to higher margin consulting and advisory services. Across the company, we see exciting opportunities ahead of us, specifically in the areas of climate response and especially in energy transition. Our ability to deliver data enabled solutions is enhancing our clients\u2019 resilience and sustainability. The establishment of Divergent Solutions enables Jacobs to scale and deploy our domain centric data platforms across multiple sectors and geographies, further enabling us to deliver solutions to typically complex challenges. I will talk to these key themes further in the presentation. Turning to Slide 5. We remain steadfastly committed to our cultural transformation to create an inspirational journey for all. In 2015, we started our culture journey with the empowerment and accountability, incorporating inclusion, innovation and inspiration into the very fabric of the company. I believe our emphasis on inclusion and diversity has been a critically important contributor to our success and provides a key differentiator in attracting and retaining the world's best talent as well as driving innovation for our clients. A key benefit of being a company with a broad range of capabilities is our ability to provide multiple career and development opportunities, what we refer to as agile careers. When we learn and grow together, we activate empowerment and accountability, inclusion and diversity and innovation. We lead, embrace and anticipate change. To further demonstrate our commitment to inclusion and diversity, we have included a KPI in the refinancing of our credit facilities linked to female leadership representation. Kevin will discuss further details in his remarks. Turning to Slide 6. Our commitment to sustainability is core to our strategy and our significant performance is being recognized by many of the top ESG accredited institutions. Over the past five years, we have advanced to an industry leading status. This culminated in our inclusion into 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, ranking Jacobs among the world's leading companies with outstanding sustainability performance. While the scores themselves are impressive, what's even more significant is the public recognition of Jacobs' positive impact on our clients, communities and the world. As we turn to Slide 7, we will focus on our 4 key growth sectors of critical infrastructure, energy and environment, advanced facilities and national security. These growth sectors are are driven by the following catalysts : federal government stimulus from the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, supply chain and technology investments in advanced facilities and the emergence of increased global threats. Let's examine the legislative drivers first and our positioning in the market. I am proud that Jacobs has helped our clients secure over $1 billion in IIJA competitive grants since its patent, and the bill is only in its early stages. We supported our clients in securing over $350 million in IIJA competitive grant funding just last quarter, the largest quarter since the passing of the act. This includes the largest grant awarded nationwide for subway station accessibility in New York City, a major port infrastructure development grant to a long term client in Alaska, the first phase award of one of the largest water treatment plants in the US and the design of a sustainable battery recycling facility. With another four years of locked in and robust funding the US infrastructure climate is strong. The coming months will also bring the first dollars of two other areas of focus for Jacobs. The inflation Reduction Act with $369 billion to fund the Green Economy transition and the CHIPS Act for semiconductor investment, all in core Jacob sectors. Before the end of the calendar year, we fully expect to have all three bills firing at full strength and funding critical projects sponsored by local governments, the federal government and the semiconductor industry. This overlap of spending will continue for four or five consecutive fiscal quarters and drive growth across the infrastructure and energy markets. In advanced facilities, we continue to see sustained capital investment in the semiconductor manufacturing space, biotechnology capacity expansions and the electric vehicle ecosystem, all being driven by reshaping of global supply chains, technology advancements and decarbonization efforts. Turning to Slide 8. As evidenced by double digit pipeline growth in each of these sectors, our industry position continues to grow, and we see this being a long term secular trend. In addition to previously discussed infrastructure wins, we have been awarded major programs in the semiconductor space to include greenfield expansions in the US and Europe for a global chip manufacturer. In the biotechnology sector, we have won multiple expansions in the US, Europe and Asia, and we continue to see global growth in electric vehicle ecosystem driven by a favorable regulatory environment with project wins for battery and vehicle manufacturing and charging infrastructure in the US and Europe. Within National Security, we are seeing increased defense spending in the US, UK and Australia due to continued global threat. As highlighted as a future prospect last quarter, in the US, we were successful in winning a critical Cyber Intelligence Award for $469 million, five year contract for a classified defense customer to provide secure data and network solutions globally. In the UK, PA is leading the consortium that has been selected by the MoD to deliver Crenic, a future force protection electronic countermeasures program. It will provide the next generation of innovative solutions to counter the threat posed by radio controlled and provides explosive devices, otherwise known as IEDs. And in Australia, we are supporting the acquisition and sustainment of military platforms for the Australian Defense Department, which has engaged Jacobs with increasing volumes of work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. Let's turn to Slide 9 for a financial overview of our first quarter results. First quarter gross revenue grew 12% year-over-year and net revenue grew 8%. Net revenue grew 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, an acceleration from our fiscal year 2022 constant currency growth of 8%. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26%, sequentially in line with the fourth quarter, but as expected, was down approximately 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by : one, the remaining year-over-year impact of the Idaho remediation contract; and two, lower utilization and NPA consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Both People & Places Solutions and Divergent Solutions gross margins were flat year-over-year. We expect total gross margins to remain plus or minus 26% of net revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year and trending higher as we exit the year from a higher margin mix of revenue and new higher margin opportunities from our growth accelerators. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.5%, slightly higher than Q4 but down 130 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from lower employee benefit costs, which were mostly offset by miscellaneous other cost. During the remainder of the fiscal year, we plan to make additional investments in employee welfare programs such as higher 401(k) match and improved medical benefits as part of our continued investment in improving our culture and employee engagement. These costs are factored into our full year outlook. As a result, we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $238 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $28 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future of work strategy and finally, other acquisition deal related costs and restructuring efforts of $17 million. Actual restructuring costs were less than half of these costs and supported the creation of our new Divergent Solutions reporting segment. The remaining costs are largely related to PA noncash contingent equity based agreements associated with our PA transaction structure. Adjusted operating profit was $332 million, up 8% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 15% year-over-year. We remain committed to reducing our restructuring related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect $15 million of restructuring charges for the full year fiscal year 2023. We also expect another $30 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of Q2 and Q3 as we further execute our future work strategy. Finally, we expect approximately $20 million of transaction related expenses from deal related integration and other costs, most of which is performance based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions. It also includes the noncash contingent based equity associated with our PA transaction structure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, flat year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.07 per share and included a $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles a $0.16 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, a $0.09 adjustment to align to our projected annual tax rate and a $0.09 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.67, up 7% year-over-year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $339 million and was up 9% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 1% year- over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 times with our gross margin in backlog as a percentage of net revenue up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Our book-to-bill ratios continue to be impacted by the burn of the approaching NASA -- Kennedy NASA rebid as the project's backlog continues to fall until which time the rebid is awarded. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q1. Before delving into the details by segment, I would like to make some overall comments regarding the strength and diversity of Jacobs portfolio. As you all know, all aspects of our portfolio are aligned with long term secular growth trends. Our results in the quarter exhibit the strength of this diversity and its ability to deliver strong consistent operating profit growth. In this quarter, our People & Places Solutions business led the way. So let's start with them. Overall, People & Places delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends that Bob discussed earlier. Q1 net revenue was up 8% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency. All business units contributed solid and often very strong constant currency growth. Backlog grew 2% year-over-year and gross margin and backlog was up double digits in constant currency with a book-to-bill greater than 1. Total People & Places Solutions Q1 gross margins were flat year-over-year, with Q1 operating profit up 20% and 28% in constant currency. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 14.5%, up over 140 basis points year-over-year, driven by revenue growth and a disciplined management of overhead costs. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit and margin, resulting in strong double digit growth in full year operating profit. Our Advanced Facilities unit which benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted the strongest double digit revenue and operating profit growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients, and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients, which comprise two thirds of our People & Places business. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our advanced facilities growth rate to remain strong during fiscal year 2023 despite the very solid and strong 2022 year-over-year comparisons. Our Americas unit had an outstanding quarter with over 20% year-over-year operating profit growth, driven by infrastructure related monetization wins beginning to convert to revenue. The backlog and sales pipeline provides us confidence as we are seeing many large programs mature for a late 2023 or early 2024 award, which should continue to support longer term momentum. Our international business, Q1 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year on a reported basis but grew double digits in constant currency. Our international business will continue to be materially impacted by FX during Q2 and with FX neutralizing over the second half of our fiscal year, assuming no large variation from existing current foreign exchange rates. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support. The business is aligned to national security, space exploration and energy transition priorities mainly in the US, Europe and Australia as well as infrastructure monetization solutions such as US 5G telecom investments. Q1 revenue was up 10% year-over-year and up 13% in constant currency, driven by the Idaho nuclear remediation project contract that ramped up in Q2 of last year. For the remainder of fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits for the CMS business as we now compare to quarters that include the Idaho project. CMS book to bill was just over 1 times and continues to be impacted by the approaching NASA Kennedy rebid, which we expect to be awarded soon. Gross profit margins were down year-over-year due to the revenue mix impact from the lower margin remediation project and the year ago closeout benefits associated with our strong performance on several enterprise contracts. CMS operating profit was $82 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 6% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin was in line with expectations and was down 170 basis points year-over-year to 7.6%, but up 60 basis points sequentially from the Q4 figure. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023 with the ability to expand margins as we can convert higher margin opportunities in our sales pipeline. Moving to Divergent Solutions. Gross revenue was up 11% year-over-year. And when excluding the impact from pass-throughs, net revenue increased 7% year-over-year. We expect net revenue growth to accelerate materially in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings. Gross margins in Divergent are in line with our consolidated gross margin, which we believe provides us the ability to significantly expand DVS operating margins as we gain additional scale from our heightened growth investments. Operating profit margins were 6%, driven by early stage investments and well below our future run rate projections for this business as we begin to embed integrated [data] enabled offerings in our core markets. We expect Divergent to finish fiscal 2023 with margins approaching double digits. Turning to PA Consulting. The translation impact from a stronger US dollar from the year ago period continued to impact reported revenue and operating profit growth. Revenue from PA was down 3% year-over-year in US dollars but up over 11% in British pounds. PA had a solid book-to-bill of over 1 times. We expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during fiscal year 2023. Turning to profitability. During fiscal year 2022, PA aggressively hired ahead of an increasing demand from strong secular growth opportunities across energy transition, sustainable consumer goods and strategic and digital transformation opportunities. While the sales pipeline remains robust and backlog continues to grow, the delayed conversion of these opportunities into burn continues to impact utilization. As a result, Q1 operating profit margins were 18%. While actions have been taken to significantly improve utilization, we expect margins to improve incrementally approaching 20% as we exit the fiscal year. Our nonallocated corporate costs were $40 million, down year-over-year as we made a strategic decision to move to a more flexible paid time off program in the US and invest further enhanced employee welfare plans, including improved medical, 401(k) match benefits and parental leave offerings. We believe this strategic decision is key to further strengthening our culture and attracting and retaining world class talent. While Q1 was lower than our previous quarter run rate guidance, we do expect that our corporate costs for the year will increase to our previous estimate of $190 million to $210 million. And we are monitoring our medical and other fringe costs closely which can vary depending upon our revenue and delivery mix as well as seasonality of medical claims. Turning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings power and cash conversion capabilities. Free cash flow was $270 million and included an outflow of $60 million for payment of the CARES Act deferral benefit of payroll taxes and $6 million related to transaction costs and other items. Excluding the unusual payment associated with the CARES Act, our underlying free cash flow for the quarter was a very strong $330 million. In the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to approximate the year ago figure driven by the very strong Q1 performance. For the full year, we continue to anticipate 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we repurchased approximately $140 million of share during the quarter. As we previously have discussed -- as we previously announced, the Board of Directors has also approved a new three year $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares if we see price dislocation in our relative valuation. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulting in $2.3 billion of net debt. Our Q1 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5 times is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. And given our commitment to inclusion and diversity, all of Jacobs bank debt now has a sustainability linked KPR target of achieving a 40% female representation in our management team as defined as our Vice President and above population. As of the end of Q1, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, which includes our $500 million notional interest rate lock of 2.7%. As of the first quarter, our weighted average interest cost was 4.6%. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on March 24th. Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12. Our portfolio is positioned to benefit from multiple secular growth trends across our core sectors with the opportunity to structurally increase our long term earnings power by executing against our growth accelerators of climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. We reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.20 to $7.50, which incorporates recent FX rates. In closing, I would like to reiterate my priorities as CEO to maintain an inspirational and inclusive culture that will capitalize on our growth accelerators and drive long term returns for our shareholders. Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere condolences on behalf of Jacobs to all those affected by the terrible earthquakes that occurred in Turkey and Syria earlier this week. Our employees have yet again demonstrated a culture of caring and practice by raising their hands to seek ways to support those most impacted by this tragedy. I'm proud to lead a company that rises to the calling in such challenging circumstances. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Adam Bubes : This is Adam Bubes on for Jerry Revich today. Now that your leverage ratio has declined. Can you provide an update on the M&A pipeline, and if you'd care to comment on opportunity set by line of business? Bob Pragada : Go ahead, Kevin. Kevin Berryman : So look, I think the M&A pipeline, we have a list of opportunities at every single point in time. There are things that are of interest. But ultimately, I would suggest to you that we really have nothing to comment on other than we do believe there's some things that are aligned with our strategy. And remember, how we think about our deployment of capital against M&A is to be aligned with our accelerators. So it's climate response, that's data consulting, data solutions and data -- consulting and advisory. So those are the areas we're continuing to focus on. And certainly, given the strong cash flow that we continue to generate, we'll have degrees of freedom to deploy that capital as appropriate when we see value added opportunities. Operator : The next question is from Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy Wittmann : Kevin, I guess I just wanted to dig in a little bit to some of the comments you made about I guess, some of the adjustments here. So you previously said $15 million of restructuring. You reiterated that again, obviously noting some real estate impairments that are noncash. But I guess here you took an exclusion on Focus 2023 expenses. I guess I wasn't expecting that. Could you talk about what that was in the quarter, what you're hoping to achieve with that? And maybe what the expectation or the budget is for the year, if there are going to be any further Focus 2023 expenses? Kevin Berryman : The focus 2023 to the extent that there is any indications that are really related to the real estate impairment. It's part of our overall Focus 2023 initiative. So it's not over and above the kind of real estate impairments that I highlighted. Andy Wittmann : Might have been viewed as future of work\u2026 Kevin Berryman : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Bob, you talked about your drivers, the key drivers in the end markets and how they will be impacted. How comfortable do you feel as you're taking over here how you're positioned from a resource basis to drive that growth, what areas there\u2019d be more tension paid upon? And of the several different end markets that you see, you did touch on some of them in your prepared remarks. But what ones could we expect to see some more better growth, better opportunities for Jacobs not only just to increase the book your bookings, but also drive the higher margin mix that you're anticipating? Bob Pragada : From a resources standpoint, Michael, I'd say that we're feeling comfortable. And really, it goes back to what we've talked about previously. Our use of global talent has really balanced our ability to deliver on our clients\u2019 expectations. So it's not where the capital is being deployed. It doesn't necessarily map to where we source talent and deliver the solutions that were expected and can deliver. So we're really positive about the resources front. As far as of the areas that we're looking at, I'd say that specifically in infrastructure and even more specifically in energy transition is providing some real overextended growth opportunities. And that was very evident this quarter in our growth in pipeline, I talked about double digit composite for the entirety of our insectors, the highest was energy transition. And we've got a great base, great talent, great solutions and with work that we've already been doing in the renewable space for quite a while, it's serving us well. Operator : The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Bob, you mentioned four years of locked in funding for IIJ and that you expected funding from IIJ, IRA and the CHIPS Act to be a strong run rate by the end of the calendar year. Maybe you can give us a little more color regarding what that could mean for PPS NSR. You're already growing NSR at 8%. So does it mean you could trend higher than that, and is there any risk that DC related budget noise can impact the infrastructure ramp up? Bob Pragada : So let me answer the last part first. I think that the infrastructure ramp up is pretty locked in with regards to IIJ. And then the effects that the IRA and the CHIPS Act will be supplemental to that. My comment about the end of the year is that those three will be in real time. So we're feeling comfortable about that four year time line. I think what's also important to understand is that when we -- the difference between the appropriation, the deployment of the funds and capital and then the duration of the projects, programs and engagements, that has a tail on it that's six to seven years. And so you see -- Kevin talked about the backlog growth in revenue being kind of in that mid single digits, but the gross margin being in double digits on a constant currency basis, that's really a function of where we are in the phasing of that work. So comfortable on that front. As far as could that mean incremental growth to what we've already projected in our out year plan, we're feeling strongly that it could really be a big part of the company. So we're optimistic. Operator : Your next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Jamie. So on CMS, I was wondering if you continue to expect low to mid 8% margins for the year? And is there any opportunity to look at divesting underperforming or noncore businesses in CMS and focus more on higher margin businesses, in particular, now with Claudia on board. Kevin Berryman : So look, I think we are a proactive team that always evaluates what we believe is the right portfolio for our company, both now and into the future. We've proven that by the divestiture that we executed against in 2019 with the sale of our Energy, Chemicals and Resources business, which one could argue was actually the legacy of the company. So we are always proactive in that consideration. So I'll leave it there. And so we can't really comment on anything other than, look, we always consider the opportunities. As it relates to CMS, we do believe that they are going to be able to get up into the 8% margins over the course of the year. So we see improving, they're at a point in time where some of the wins that they've had, which are a little bit higher margin are yet to kind of get into the burn. And we would expect that, that will be happening over the course of the balance of the year. Bob Pragada : If I could add just one item to what Kevin said. When we talk about energy transition, please keep in mind that, that includes components of CMS that\u2019s around our our nuclear new build and the AMR SMR technologies that we have, and we're seeing some real opportunities and growth in Europe that will be contributing to the margin profile that Kevin mentioned. Kevin Berryman : And just to clarify as well, when we talk about the future, I think we're approaching 8% for the year, which means because we started at the level we are, we're going to have to be having in subsequent quarters margins that are going to be above 8%. Operator : The next question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : On the potential DC lockdown or just headlines around a prolonged continuing resolution. Just Maybe, Kevin, you kind of walk through on -- I know we talked on IIJ, but even on the CMS side, anything that we should be aware of that could lead to orders being pushed out, rebid being pushed out? Are you hearing any of that based on some of the headlines we're seeing down in DC? Bob Pragada : Go ahead, and then I'll back you up. Kevin Berryman : Look, I think the bottom line is we have an Omnibus in place for 2023. So what we're really fundamentally talking about is a continuing resolution for 2024. Look, it remains to be seen how that plays out. Clearly, there's some differences of opinion in the house right now relative to where we may end up. I would say the good news is relative to this, if there is good news, is that we're kind of based off a strong Omnibus program in 2023, it could impact new items getting funded, but we're based on a 23% kind of level, which is pretty straightforward. As it relates to the disruption relative to the debt and whatnot, we think our view is they\u2019ll come to some rational conclusion on that, but we'll see how that plays out. Bob Pragada : And right now, the programs, Michael, that we're looking at are not totally insulated, but we've got a strong view on those programs being funded here in the near term -- awarded. Operator : The next question is from Robert Connors with Stifel. Robert Conners : Well, first off, Bob, if I remember correctly, I'm wishing your birds a good luck next weekend. And I guess for my question, you guys have a lot of tailwinds going into the back half, strong outlook on various end markets. Just sort of wondering what your thinking was with around sort of maintaining the guidance, especially with currency sort of being a tailwind here. Kevin Berryman : Well, there's a couple of things that we have to recognize certainly exchange rates are a positive, but also we have incremental interest costs that are largely offsetting that. So there's gives and takes here. I think given the dynamic of how we're playing out in DC, I think we're being prudent relative to our guidance that we've provided. And look, there's gives and takes here. FX isn't the only one. I would say, certainly, interest is some headwinds that we're facing and then the business is kind of net off. And I think at the end of the day, we're I think, positioned for good results for the full year fiscal 2023. Bob Pragada : And then, Robert, maybe I'll make a couple of comments on the markets. The reason why we highlighted those four sectors that we did is the tailwinds that we are seeing and it's materializing in the double digit pipeline growth, the backlog growth that we're seeing and our bookings performance, all leading indicators to strengthen those markets. The burn of those bookings is something we continue to monitor very closely. But the stage that we're coming in on those programs are creating a higher level of utilization, specifically in the US for the Jacobs business. Operator : The next question is from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Louie DiPalma : Congrats to everyone on your promotions and new positions. As it relates to the exceptional strength for advanced facilities for this current fiscal 2023 on top of 2022, Kevin, I think you mentioned how this is [called on]. And I was wondering, should investors expect a consistent long term upward trajectory for advanced facilities with all of the stimulus funding from the CHIPS Act, or will it be lumpy in certain years as funding maybe inconsistent? Bob Pragada : Louie, I think if you go back over a decade ago, that lumpiness was -- in the time between cycles, whether it be semi or in life sciences was a lot longer. We're seeing those cycles contract look at the current semi cycle as well. And so we think that, that long term growth aspect versus what we used to see a decade ago, we've demonstrated that the diversity of our portfolio has been able to really sustain that. You mentioned '22, it was also '21 as well. So we're feeling really positive there. The other item I would highlight is that it's the reason what's driving these growth catalysts, the reason why we highlighted the supply chain disruption as well as technology advancements is that in the past, the lumpiness was driven by demand. And so capacity was almost exclusively tied to demand and then you could just map it via economic cycles. Today, that has completely changed and the drivers are more driven around technology advancements, reshaping of supply chains from the east to the west as well as innovations that are happening in, whether it be chip design or novel therapy. So the drivers also give us that level of confidence too. Operator : The next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about recompetes, besides the Kennedy contract over the next 18, 24 months, do you have any big ones coming up? And then just related to the continuing resolution risk around the budget next year, are there any programs that kind of new programs that -- in your prior guidance, you were counting on growing, but that might not be able to grow in such an environment? Anything that we should be thinking about as a potential headwinds in '24? Bob Pragada : Maybe I'll talk first on the recompetes. Outside of Kennedy, for the next 12 to 18 months, I think that was the time line that you put it at nothing of that size. We have smaller recompetes that are probably a little less under the radar -- a little bit more under the radar. But those are well within the normal cycle of our business. On the CR with new programs, Gautam, that's one where we continue to be very sensitive to that. From a recompete standpoint, those could end up being upside for us, because we're on programs that are continuing to be determined. But I think the diversity of our portfolio has lessened the impact of what we saw historically with CRs. And so I think that's where -- I think it would not be wise of us to predict the effect of CRs. But I think the diversity is where we see the hedge and we feel confident about our business. Operator : The next question is from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Josh Sullivan : Just to follow up on that a little bit. As far as the NASA Kennedy rebid itself, given so many changes in the space industry and emergence of a lot of commercial space interest, where is your confidence in retaining the work? Bob Pragada : Our confidence is solid. As whether it be NASA or other clients you could even outside the aerospace world, we've grown with our clients. So the intimacy that we have with the science of our clients\u2019 business has allowed us to be their long term advocate and long term partner. So wherever the space industry goes, a movement to commercial, which we're involved with or in other areas of exploration, we've been a part of that journey and a valued partner. So we're feeling confident. Operator : The next question is from Chad Dillard with AB Bernstein. Unidentified Analyst : This is Brandon on for Chad. Follow-up on CMS margins. You said that ending the year above 8% to give the full year to 8%. But given the high margin projects you all have been talking about, is it safe to assume that we can expect that exit rate to be the prevailing rate going forward and could the margins potentially approach People & Places levels given all these projects? Kevin Berryman : That would certainly be consistent with our strategy. I would say the margin burn that I was referring to is second half oriented primarily. So as we look to beyond 2023, certainly consistent with our strategy, we are always looking for an incremental profit improvement in terms of margin. So yes, that would be consistent with our execution strategy. Operator : The next question is from Alex Dwyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Alex Dwyer : This is Alex on for Sean this morning. So my question, the backlog was very strong this quarter and it looks like all segments grew sequentially from 4Q. You guys had highlighted this gross margin in the backlog was up 100 basis points. Can you guys talk a little bit about what's driving this 100 basis point increase in margin? Is it one or two segments or is it more broad based in all the segments? Bob Pragada : I'd say it's broad based. This is -- again, when we keep reiterating, moving up the value chain with our clients, these are higher higher level technically complex as well as digitally enabled offerings that we have now in the marketplace, which is driving that higher margin in our backlog. And so it's not acutely focused in a specific one area, it's across the board. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Bob Pragada : All right. Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. Looking forward to future calls and providing further updates on upcoming events and on our further calls. So thank you very much, and have a great week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Jacobs Solutions Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I will turn things over to Mr. Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Evans. Jonathan Evans : Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website which we'll reference during the call. In addition, this morning, we published a release announcing our intent to create 2 independent companies with the separation of our Critical Mission Solutions business. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined by our incoming CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of today's portfolio announcement, then summarizing highlights from our second quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks. And then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Jonathan and thank all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Jacobs has a story of 75-year history of delivering value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We have consistently strived to improve our company through a purposeful strategy of transforming our portfolio to capture higher value opportunities in our core and adjacent markets. Turning to Slide 4. Today's announcement marks a key inflection point as we progress on our journey of continuous improvement and value creation. This morning, Jacobs announced our intent to separate our Critical Mission Solutions business through a spin-off. The decision to separate CMS is a result of a comprehensive review and evaluation to identify opportunities that streamline our portfolio and maximize strategic focus and potential growth opportunities for both future companies. We will sharpen both companies focus on their distinct strategies and operational initiatives that are most relevant to the specific industries in which they operate. Each company will have a tailored capital allocation and structure that is directed towards their respective growth strategies as well as a strength and ability to attract and retain top talent. Moving forward, in addition to our industry-leading position in core sectors, Jacobs will be a higher growth, higher margin, technology-enabled solutions provider continuing to address the world's most complex critical infrastructure and sustainability challenges. Jacobs\u2019s core skill sets in technical and consulting services, coupled with data science and technology-enabled expertise will continue to differentiate us from our peers and allow us to provide end-to-end solutions to our global clients. Our streamlined portfolio will include leading positions in critical infrastructure such as water and environment, energy transition, transportation and the advanced manufacturing sectors. Once the separation is complete, we can focus our attention on building additional capabilities and expertise that matter most to our clients in these areas. And importantly, we'll achieve even greater alignment with our 3 key accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. The new CMS will be a leading pure play government services company that provides technical consulting, applied science research, training, intelligent asset management and program management services to federal government agencies. CMS generated approximately $4.4 billion in FY '22 revenue. Today's announcement is another step in Jacobs' long record of taking bold actions to drive value creation and position our company for an even stronger future. And as we grow and thrive, our partners can achieve more as well. I want to emphasize that this announcement does not change how we work with our clients. As we work towards the separation, it will be business as usual. We remain committed to delivering world-class service to our clients, who will be able to rely on our people they know and trust. Turning to Slide 5. The proposed capital structure, governance and other matters relating to the separation will be communicated at a later date. Subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, we are targeting to complete the separation in the second half of fiscal year 2024 through a distribution that is intended to be tax free to Jacobs shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Turning to Slide 6. I want to reinforce the importance of our inclusive and forward-thinking culture. Last quarter, we reinforced our commitment to inclusion and diversity by including a gender quality KPI in our sustainability linked bond. Jacobs remains categorically committed to this goal. Turning to Q2 on Slide number 7. I want to thank our more than 60,000 global teammates for delivering a record second quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our underlying business remains strong and we continue to drive growth organically. We continue to invest behind and grow share in all key areas of focus against our 3 needle-moving growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. Our People & Places line of business delivered strong performance with net revenue up 7% year-on-year, 10% in constant currency and operating profit up 21% year-over-year, 25% in constant currency. Our pipeline and gross margin in backlog increased further supported by strong legislative drivers materializing in federal, state and local initiatives. CMS remains a stable base of recurring revenue driven primarily this quarter by the NASA Kennedy rebid award. CMS Q2 revenue was 11% higher than the previous quarter and 5% higher year-over-year. In terms of bookings this quarter, CMS also achieved an impressive overall win rate and the outlook for FY '23 continues to look strong with its pipeline up double digits year-over-year. We continue to invest behind CMS opening our Japan office during Q2, our first organic office opening since 2004. PA Consulting sales and backlog again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and utilities and defense sectors demonstrating momentum and consistency. I'm pleased to see margins improved in the quarter to over 20%, supported by milestone incentive achievement. PA continues to benefit from increased opportunities in Europe. For example, PA won a mandate for a private Scandinavian renewable energy company that is currently active in renewable electricity generation and storage. PA is working with the client to create a market entry strategy across offshore and onshore wind in several new European markets. Our divergent solutions operating unit had a strong operating profit quarter with operating profit up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we extended our collaboration with Palantir across multiple infrastructure applications. Kevin will give more detail in his comments. Looking across the broader market environment, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for growth in climate response and energy and environment. For example, our approximately $2 billion water business continues to exceed expectations and reinforce our position in the water sector. Water continues to be a pacesetter with pipeline growth up materially year-over-year. During Q2, we were awarded the Donald advanced water purification facility by the LA Bureau Sanitation, 1 of the largest reuse projects in the U.S. delivering a more sustainable drinking water source in a drought stressed region. Fittingly, we would like to call attention to drinking water week, an opportunity to proudly celebrate the work we do with utility partners to provide safe drinking water to millions of people around the world. Our cities and places pipeline also grew double digits, including key wins in the Middle East, where we are working to reimagine urban development addressing major environmental and quality of life challenges and predominantly powered by clean energy. Globally, we are seeing significant energy transition opportunities. Last month, we efficiently launched a dedicated business unit in PMPS to focus on significant opportunities in global energy transition to accelerate growth and address the ever-expanding needs of our clients. Turning to Slide 8. During Q2, we were awarded the Gold Medal Award for International Corporate Achievement and Sustainable Development by the World Environment Center, a nongovernmental organization advancing sustainable development through corporate business practices. Their annual Gold Medal Award recognizes 1 international company demonstrating a global vision and a commitment to sustainable development through innovative applications of policies, economic, environmental and social responsibilities. The independent jury commended our thoughtful approach to sustainability, combining commitments with global initiatives and partnerships with positive and far-reaching impact. Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we remain well positioned with our industry-leading ranking across multiple sectors. This is particularly evident in our advanced manufacturing business, where our long-term pipeline increased double digits year-over-year. Further, in our infrastructure business, legislative actions continue to provide visible growth opportunities despite continued political debate on broader topics. For example, recent wins this quarter include 3 significant intelligent O&M programs in California, Florida and Louisiana which we secured through strong differentiation with the use of our digitally enabled platform. We expect operating profit growth to outpace organic top line increases as we remain focused on quality of backlog. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob and good day to everyone. Turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of our second quarter results. Second quarter gross revenue grew 6% year-over-year and net revenue grew 5%. Net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, a continuation of healthy growth against a tough 10% year ago comparison. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 26% sequentially in line with the first quarter but down year-over-year. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was 15.6%, approximately flat sequentially but down 90 basis points year-over-year, more than offsetting the lower gross margin percentage versus last year. While we felt the impacts from inflationary pressure, costs were managed well overall to a disciplined cost management. We are still targeting G&A as a percentage of net revenue to stay below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023. GAAP operating profit was $290 million for the quarter and included $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, a $10 million noncash charge related to decrease in our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy and other acquisition deal-related costs and restructuring efforts of $8 million. These deal-related costs are largely incentive compensation that was considered part of total consideration and PA noncash contingent equity-based agreements associated with the PA transaction structure. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $356 million, up 7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit was up 11% year-over-year. We remain committed to reducing our restructuring-related costs. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect approximately $15 million of restructuring charges for fiscal year 2023. We also expect a total $50 million to $55 million in noncash real estate impairment charges over the course of the year as we continue to further execute our work -- future of work strategy. Finally, we expect $25 million of transaction-related expenses for the full year from deal-related integration and other costs, most of which is performance-based incentives that were factored into our total purchase price consideration for these acquisitions. It also includes the noncash contingent-based equity noted earlier associated with our PA transaction structure. These costs do not include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS, given the early stage of our process. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.4%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.70 per share and included a $0.20 -- $0.26 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, a $0.06 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint, $0.03 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs and a $0.25 adjustment to align to our projected annual normalized adjusted tax rate as a result of a large FIN 48 reserve release. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $1.81, up 5% year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, Bob will provide an overview of our narrowed guidance range later in his prepared remarks. We also note that our Q3 EPS is expected to be relatively flat sequentially to Q2. I would like to highlight that the fiscal year 2022 third quarter adjusted results benefited from a onetime $0.10 gain on an equity investment. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $358 million and was up 5% year-over-year, representing 10.4% of net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year and 5% on a constant currency basis. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x with our gross margin in backlog, again, improving year-over-year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11 for Q2. Our results in the quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and end market resiliency, enabling us to deliver strong, consistent OP growth. People & Places Solutions continues to drive our momentum. Overall, PMPS delivered strong revenue and operating profit results driven by an alignment to the secular growth trends and legislative drivers previously highlighted. Q2 net revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units although Europe continues to see some pressure. Backlog grew 4% year-over-year behind a book-to-bill of 1.1x. Gross margin in backlog was up nearly double digits in constant currency. Q2 operating profit was up 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong growth and G&A control. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.5%, up over 150 basis points year-over-year, again, driven by solid revenue growth and continued cost discipline. We continue to expect year-over-year improvement in People & Places operating profit margin resulting in strong double-digit growth in full year operating profit. Our Advanced Facilities unit which benefits from the investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains posted another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We continue to monitor the macro demand trends across sectors that impact our advanced manufacturing clients and we continue to see robust demand from our life sciences clients which comprise approximately 2/3 of this business. In semiconductors, the evolving macro backdrop has led some smaller clients to evaluate project timing but we remain confident in the long duration opportunity ahead for Jacobs. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains robust across a diverse set of customers. And as a result, we continue to expect our Advanced Facilities growth rate to persist against a very strong year ago comparisons. Our People & Places Americas unit reported record Q2 profit with 30% year-over-year growth as our high-quality backlog begins to convert to revenue at improving incremental margins. We remain enthusiastic about our growth opportunity as backlog and sales pipelines remain robust as we compare to stronger year-ago comparisons. In particular, our water sales pipeline of opportunities continues to shine, up double digits. Our international business, Q2 revenue and operating profit were up single digits year-over-year. Asia Pacific and the Middle East continues to grow, driven by strong pipelines in transportation, cities and places and energy transition. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions CMS benefits from highly recurring multiyear contracts that require limited overhead support. The business is aligned to space exploration, national security, nuclear remediation priorities and U.S. 5G telecom investments. Q2 revenue was up 5% year-over-year and up 7% in constant currency. CMS book-to-bill was just over 1.4x benefiting from the Kennedy award that we previously disclosed. As a result, backlog is up 8% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains strong with $30 billion in new opportunities that we are pursuing. In addition, we are awaiting award on $10 billion in new business opportunities that are in the end gain select process. CMS gross profit margins improved sequentially due to mix. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially from Q1 and consistent with our previous guidance but down slightly versus the very strong year ago quarter. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of fiscal 2023, with full year CMS margins expected to approach 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher-margin opportunities. Moving to Divergent Solutions. Net revenue declined 3% year-over-year as we focus on quality growth opportunities that will translate into higher margins. We continue to expect net revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of our fiscal year as we start to see growth from our investments in sales, data solutions and technology offerings. Operating profit for the -- operating profit margin for the quarter was above our corporate average at 11.1%. During the quarter, we recognized a large license sale which expanded the margin by more than 300 basis points. Sales of these types of solutions are now a longer-term financial benefit of our Divergent Solutions strategy and a core offering of the reporting unit. Although deals of this size should not be expected to recur every quarter. Even excluding the benefits of the license sale, the underlying margin momentum seen in Q2 continued to improve sequentially for our previous guidance. As a result, we expect Divergent quarterly margins to approach 10% as we near the end of the fiscal year the scale begins to further mitigate the impact of the continued investments for growth. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 1% year-over-year in U.S. dollars but up over 11% in local currency. PA once again reported a book-to-bill over 1x. We continue to expect revenue growth in British pounds to remain near or above 10% during the second half of fiscal 2023. Turning to profitability. Q2 operating profit margin for PA was 21.8%, up 370 basis points sequentially due to fixed price milestone achievements and lower incentive costs. As PA continues to take actions to improve utilization, we expect OP margins to be around 20% in the back half, relatively close to their year-to-date OP margin performance. Our unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q2, an increase over our previous run rate estimate, driven by inflationary pressure in health care and digital investments. For the full year, we now expect our quarterly run rate for the balance of the year and unallocated corporate costs to be in line with our Q2 level, driven by inflationary pressure in health care costs and incentive costs. Turning to Slide 12 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. We posted another strong quarter of cash flow generation which is indicative of the quality of earnings power and cash conversion capabilities. Free cash flow was $97 million, resulting in approximately 100% conversion of net income into free cash flow for the first half of fiscal year 2023. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we will remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and a gross debt of $3.5 billion resulting in just over $2.2 billion of net debt. Our Q2 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. As of the end of Q2, approximately 60% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt and our weighted average interest rate was 4.8%. In February, Jacobs completed the refinancing of existing debt and Jacob's inaugural issuance of a $500 million sustainability-linked bond. The bond was priced at a competitive fixed rate and includes a KPI aligned with Jacobs commitment to increase gender diversity and leadership positions and to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. For your benefit, in the appendix of this presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend which increased 13% year-over-year and which will be paid on June 23. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bob. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 13. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives and narrow our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. Finally, with today's announcement, we are reinforcing our continuous commitment to take proactive actions to create greater shareholder value as well as strategic and value-creating benefits for both future companies and their respective stakeholders. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this morning from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Congratulations on a nice quarter. I guess my first question, just sort of related to the spin. Can you just sort of help us talk through your decision to spin versus sell the asset and/or any sort of dissynergies associated with spinning the CMS business? And then I have a follow-up question after that. Robert Pragada : Okay. So maybe I'll start off and then Kevin, I'll turn it over to you. With regards to the second part first, Jamie, we do not see dissynergies with the spin. On the spin, specifically, we were looking for the most optimal tax-free benefit for our shareholders as well as our confidence in the business that it has the credibility and the horsepower to operate successfully as an independent entity. So those were kind of the drivers we're looking to obviously maximize shareholder value. Kevin, anything you want to add? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, I think we've evaluated all alternatives. And at the end of the day, given the facts and circumstances that Bob has highlighted, we're excited about the announcement of the spin. But as circumstances change or anything comes to light, we would certainly have to consider that because we are interested in maximizing shareholder value. Jamie Cook : And then I guess just my other just sort of now that we're sort of splitting the businesses, is there any way you could sort of frame how you think about longer-term or medium-term organic growth or margin targets associated with the different businesses as they sit today? Robert Pragada : Yes. Maybe I'll answer the first part and then you talk about margin targets, Kevin. So as far as our growth expectations for the business, they're very strong and in line with what we articulated in our '22 strategy for the segment reporting. So we feel that pipeline as well as the opportunities in front of us with the platform that we have, looks very, very bright for the RemainCo post spin. Kevin, you want to add anything? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, as we talked in the prepared remarks, as we look at the 2 businesses and we talk about 2022 kind of pro forma, if we had done something, we had a 12% margin for the People & Places business, operating profit margin and about 8% for CMS. We think that our spend will ultimately allow the 2 incremental individual companies to focus on their respective opportunities and in a manner that allows for, if anything, an acceleration in growth. I do would like to say that in the event that the spin is able to be executed, we are -- we do realize that there will be some incremental CMS public company costs that would have to be incurred but we will think we'll be able to offset and then some with our opportunities to streamline our 2 organizations. Operator : We go next now to Andy Kaplowitz at Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Congrats on the announcement. So backlog continues to rise in P&PS. Obviously, there are some cross currents given concerns around private spend but state and local governments, I think, continue to spend -- you've talked about funding ramping from the fiscal bill. So do you see backlog growth continuing there sequentially over time? And can you sustain that 10% year-over-year constant currency growth that you have in the segment? Robert Pragada : Let me answer the backlog growth. Right now, the way our pipeline is lining up, Andy, the answer is yes. We do see consistent opportunity to increase our backlog and grow the business. Part of the 10% constant currency growth on the top line, I think that's going to be dependent on the phasing of the jobs, how these jobs come out, especially on the infrastructure side as well as in our private sector business those early phases of the job tend to be more study and higher-end consulting work. And then as we move through subset phases, kind of where the larger the revenue opportunities are. So I wouldn't want to go and say that that's going to be a consistent quarterly topic but definitely a target if you were to aggregate over a period of time. Andrew Kaplowitz : And maybe a similar question with CMS. You've got did get a backlog uplift from Kennedy? And I think you mentioned that the pipeline is up double digits. But how are you thinking about backlog and CMS moving forward? What is the risk that that's going to be, could slow down bookings a bit for a couple of quarters? Robert Pragada : Actually, we see the backlog potential in CMS being strong. The pipeline of work that we have and not just the rebid but the new work that's coming down the pike they provide some real opportunity for us to continue that backlog growth. So we feel confident about that. Operator : We go next now to Michael Dudas at Vertical Research Partners. Michael Dudas : So with regard to the spin and is there any of the businesses in CMS, I guess you highlighted 5G maybe staying with the business, the automotive side? Anything from CMS that may stay with Jacobs and maybe vice versa, given some of the demand for security and issues that have been leveraged from CMS to your customer based on the PP&S side. Robert Pragada : Yes, Michael, just to clarify 1 point. We didn't -- actually 5G and automotive are a part of the CMS segment and that's actually what we were reporting today. So I just want to clarify that point. I would say as far as what stays, what goes, we're early in that process. And so to be direct and to provide clarity, it is the CMS segment today. Michael Dudas : Got it. But there's -- you're still debating where the things could adjust between now and let me set things of current? Is that what I understand? Robert Pragada : No, we're not. We're not. And so I just want to provide clarity on that. Michael Dudas : Got it. Terrific. Second question is you've -- it seems like again, the last couple of quarters, your new projects and new contracts in the backlog have come in at better margin rates than prior I assume you anticipate that going forward in both -- in all the segments? And how do you see the execution of getting that margin from the backlog to the bottom line? Is that something that we can see more acceleration as we maybe track into fiscal year 2024? Robert Pragada : Yes. So on the margins themselves, I mean, I think clearly, it's been a part of our strategy for not just '22 but '19 as well. We are in -- we continue to going up the value chain for our clients. And as we do that and we're getting more into the higher-end consultancy work, we're seeing the incremental effect on our booked margin as far as how that's dropping into the bottom line, I think 2 parts, Michael, that you're highlighting. One is that kind of excellence in project delivery which has been a part of our DNA for decades, that continues to be high on our list on delivering not only to our clients' expectation but within our financial expectation as we're booking these shops. As far as the last part of your question on the timing of that dropping to the bottom line. We're seeing a nice pace in the marketplace. And this kind of goes to all segments of our business. After a period of time, I think, in the beginning of Q1 and maybe in the back half of last year, that was having an effect on our top line and some of our actuals to forecast, that is reconciled back and hence, the performance this quarter. And so all indications that we're getting from our clients is that's going to continue. Operator : We'll go next now to Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : First 1 is kind of high level. Just rewinding to the Strategy Day from last year, we kind of got a vibe from that update that you guys were kind of embarking on a deeper integration of the business units with the Divergent Solutions segment kind of being a bridge. And today, we're kind of talking about a more exciting outlook as separate entities. So I'm just curious what changed there. I hope that's a fair question. Robert Pragada : Yes, Sean, we're constantly looking at our portfolio and doing an evaluation on how we're executing externally with our clients and the effect that, that is having on advancing our strategy. So is it -- to reflect back on what we -- where we were before. I don't think we're doing anything that's different from what we articulated in our strategy. And so we feel confident in the decision that we made today. Sean Eastman : Okay. Understood. And then relative to the Divergent Solutions dynamic between investing in growth and kind of releasing margins. Any update post the review you guys did on how you're balancing those 2 things? Kevin Berryman : Well, look, I think that we are continuing to invest in what we think is a great opportunity to enable divergent actually People & Places and PA to benefit from some of the overall investments being made in digital data capabilities for the total Jacobs. And so those investments continue because we believe there is strong rationale for a very large return relative to that. So we're not making any choices relative to those investments. We continue to make them and we're confident in the ability that the scale is growing as it did in the quarter and how we've communicated a sequential growth in terms of the top line which will translate into a growth leverage factor that translates into margin improvement. As we highlighted in our pared remarks. Nothing has changed. We feel good about that. We see visibility forward to be able to do that. So investments continue. And our growth is going to allow for us to get to the margin profile that we've communicated. Operator : We'll go next now to Bert Subin at Stifel. Bert Subin : So your updated earnings guidance range are things to contemplate maybe a slight up -- maybe a slightly more tempered growth path in the second half of this fiscal year. Can you just walk us through what you see as the potential positive drivers that could get you a little closer to the high end of $7.45 EPS? And then maybe highlight where your visibility is a little bit weaker. Robert Pragada : Kevin, why don't you start off from a market standpoint, I'll talk after that. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, clearly, as we look going forward, I think there's a couple of things to highlight. Certainly, we've got inflationary pressure on the medical cost. And ultimately, we're going to be able to pass that along to our clients. But in the short term, certainly, we're seeing some pressure in that. We saw it in the first quarter. First quarter is, as you know, the last year of our medical plan. So we wanted to get a better read on our second quarter which now is in the next plan year. We continue to see that occurring in Q2. So we're projecting that, that's going to continue through the full year. So assuming that, that didn't happen, that obviously would be a positive. But right now, that's what our expectations are. Our interest rates obviously are higher year-over-year. And we think we're at hopefully, the top end of kind of what the interest rate scenarios are going to look like and that, if anything, we're going to be able to trend down. If that happens, we're not counting on it but certainly, that would allow for us to be able to have some incremental performance in our EPS figures as well. I think the underlying business is actually quite strong. And so absent some of these dynamics, I think putting it into context, we don't really see a situation where our business is slowing. Robert Pragada : Well said. Not going to add any comment. Bert Subin : Okay, great. And maybe just a follow-up to the CMS spin announcement, now that you're doing that portfolio rationalization. How should we think about capital allocation maybe over the next 4 quarters does the transaction not taking place for another year to maybe more of a conservative view towards M&A and buybacks? Or do you go full steam ahead here now that you have the plan underway. Robert Pragada : Kevin? Kevin Berryman : So look, I think that, clearly, we have in front of us, a lot of execution that is really imperative for us to do well against. Whether that be on our business or it be the actual execution of the spin of CMS. So that is clearly job number 1. Number 2 is, because of that, certainly, I think there is a relatively high bar right now from a financial people, gross margin perspective as it relates to actually deploying additional capital in the M&A. Never say never but we think the bar is pretty high at this particular moment. So having said all of that, there certainly is opportunities to invest back in our shares as appropriate. And I think that you might want to think about that potentially happening over the course of the next several months. Robert Pragada : Yes. Just wanted to add -- we really like what we got. Operator : We'll go next now to Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher : How should we think about the second half '24 timing for the spin? I think that's within the normal range for these types of transactions. But still seems like it's a bit long dated. Is there any potential to accelerate that if it stays a spin? And what are the factors there? Just curious if the debt ceiling discussions and continuing resolutions and federal budget. Is that all a factor? Or is it more just the internal process? Kevin Berryman : No. Look, it is certainly a process, both internal but also external. So as you may be aware, the process of putting in place a structure and an organization that facilitates an ability on day 1 to execute and manage a publicly traded company is not inconsequential. And so we're not going to rush that process. And I think 12 to 18 months is actually a fairly aggressive stance in some respects. So I don't think we're going to be able -- if, in fact, it continues to be oriented around the spend to do much better than that. But occurs, we'll do whatever we can to accelerate for sure. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then P&PS is going to really be the biggest contributor to profits post spin. So there's going to be a lot of focus on that and particularly the margin. So just looking at the sequential margins this quarter were down in P&PS but up 150 basis points year-over-year. It sounds like you think we should focus on the year-over-year there. But I'm curious about how we should think about mix within P&PS and how might that affect margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Robert Pragada : Yes, Steve, a couple of things. One is that we were pretty clear last quarter that on the quarter-to-quarter or at least Q1, that had some project incentive releases that were onetime. As far -- so another way of saying we need to really take a look at the year-over-year comparisons. And then the -- for all of us to be aware that we put margin targets out at our Strategy Day. And just to do kind of a midterm report on that, we are actually a year ahead of where we said we were going to be on our margin profile. So that's a -- look at it over the period of time, so I hope that clarifies that. Kevin Berryman : So 1 thing, just to crystallize and make sure that you caught it correctly. Our margins in CMS Q1. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Robert Pragada : And as far as that continuing, Steve, I missed 1 part of your question. As far as that continuing, we evaluate based on our clients and trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. And as we said in the script, those have been very, very strong in the P&PS world. So we continue to have confidence in our business. Operator : We'll go next now to Chad Dillard of Alliance Bernstein. Charles Dillard : Just wanted to dig into the spend a little bit more with the, I guess, like the remaining Jacobs business. Can you talk about like what the cash conversion profile looks like? And how you'll think about capital allocation once the spin is done and if there's any potential gaps that need to be filled on the capability side once it's complete. Kevin Berryman : So we're early in our process, Chad. We do know that People & Places and CMS both have good cash flow characteristics. Actually, People & Places has a lower DSO level than the current CMS organization. So we're working through all of that. We'll provide incremental details relative to when we get to that space to really give greater clarity. But I think you're going to see both businesses being robust in terms of their cash flow capabilities longer term. Robert Pragada : And Chad, on the second part that you asked about the capabilities, we feel strong that we've got a strong platform. We feel strongly that we've got a really solid platform today. In areas where we continue to innovate is around our digital platforms and our digital enablement and the partnership that we have with Palantir and with others, that is that's -- those are strong platforms in order to grow without making huge investments. So we're really comfortable where we sit today. Charles Dillard : That's helpful. Then second question on PA with respect to the margin. Now you guys talked about operating margins getting to like the 20% range in the second half. But maybe kind of thinking a little bit longer term, just would like to understand what's the path to bring you back to, I guess, what your target range would be? Kevin Berryman : I would say that we think -- we're thinking longer term that there's no cap ultimately at the 20% level. So we'll work to continue to drive with the management team and ability to get back to margins that are north of 20% longer term. Operator : Next now to Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Michael Feniger : I'm just curious there, there's obviously a headline. I know someone brought up the government shutdown but there's also headlines with the House bill potentially trying to repeal the IRA clean energy tax incentives many things that's not likely. But I'm just curious on the ground through the channel on fieldwork. Are any of these headlines starting to slow project activity as these headlines pick up does it maybe push some things out to the right in the near term that we should be aware of? Robert Pragada : So Michael, the short answer is no. IIJA, that's where we made specific commentary about that in the script, has really started to incrementalize in our business and we can see it not only in our pipeline but in our bookings. And it's realizing itself in that was -- it's why we specifically called out P&PS Americas on the 30% year-over-year growth. So we're not seeing that at all. And just 1 other -- just a clarifying point on IIJA, it's a law, right? So as far as it being repealed, there would have to be significant -- there have be a new law. And so we feel confident about that. On some of these other items, those were actually in the early stages and we had not even -- we had not seen the effects of those in our pipeline or in our work. So the fact that there's a debate about those now, it's not really having that material effect on the business. Michael Feniger : Good to know. And just lastly, there was a comment about Europe. It seems like there's some mixed signals, some positives and negatives. What are you kind of seeing in Europe when we think of like the PA and the PPS business? Robert Pragada : Yes. Interesting, I kind of separated between PA and P&PS. Our PA business in the U.K. specifically is actually growing and it's been really, really strong. And that's kind of a testament to no different than Jacobs historically, real strong capabilities in those areas of global priorities and national priorities and it's around the defense sector that PA has a strong relationship with MOD as well as in energy and utilities which, in fact, is turning into a security issue in broader Europe. So that's really driving the PA business. What's driving the PA and the P&PS business is the energy security issue in the broader Continental Europe as well as in Scandinavia. And I'll give you just 1 statistic. 1 year ago, 2 years ago, of our U.K. platform which you know is really, really strong, about 90% of our folks that were based in the U.K., worked in U.K. business. Today, that's about 60-40 is where we have our talent from the U.K. working on programs and projects and engagements all throughout Europe as well as globally. And that goes into -- Kevin and I have been really vocal about that over the course of the last 3 or 4 years about tying that global talent. So it doesn't totally dampen the effect of some of the economic headwinds in Europe but our diversity is helping in that front. Operator : We go next now to Gautam Khanna at Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Congrats, Kevin and Claudia. I just wanted to go back to -- I think it was the first question in the Q&A on any sort of dissynergies and I don't mean quantitative necessarily but are there any linkages that CMS and PA or CMS and P&PS, we're able to just be more competitive on bids because you could bid the broader qualifications of the entire enterprise that might be lost and I was also thinking just when PA was acquired, I thought 1 of the thrust was to bring them outside of the U.K. which you just talked about but into the U.S. and into some of the government customers. And does that potential opportunity may be look less optimistic if CMS is not under the same roof. Robert Pragada : Yes. So Gautam, it's Bob. One of the things that -- we looked at this really, really hard. And as far as the dissynergies go, we feel pretty confident that, that's not going to be of any materiality at all. Now that said, similar to what we've done in the past, our relationship post spin with CMS is going to continue to be very strong. And so our ability to work together, collaborate and partner for the benefit of our client is going to continue to be there. So that's always going to be there. In fact, we've demonstrated that in our history with a previous divestiture that we did and that relationship continues to this date to be very, very strong. On the PA outside of the U.K., really that entrance into the U.S. which we're in real time and having success on was around the private sector in the U.S., not the government sector and more specifically around energy and utilities and health and life sciences. And those opportunities have continued In fact, today, in the U.S., we have probably 50 active pursuits with a lot of cases, bids in play with PA and we're feeling really confident about that. Gautam Khanna : And if I might follow up just on the decision to spin versus an outright sale, can you talk a little bit about what the tax basis of CMS would be because presumably, when you announce something like this that potential suitors would also be interested, I would imagine. So what is the tax basis of the enterprise CMS? Kevin Berryman : So we've evaluated all the opportunities. And depending upon if you were to do some type of other structure, we'll ultimately determine what the tax basis is. But clearly, if we did some type of other transaction, there would be some tax implications that would occur. So the fact that we've centered around executing against spend is a tax-efficient way of addressing the opportunity to create 2 separate very strong companies. And so look, I think that's how we're executing. That's our plan at this particular point in time. It takes a little bit of time given some of the discussions that we've had in the past. But that's 1 of the reasons that we consider the spin to be a highly attractive option. But as we go through the process and determine if we get any additional facts or circumstances that could change that, we'll consider that because we are ultimately interested in ensuring that we maximize shareholder value. Operator : And we'll take our final question this morning from Andy Wittmann of Baird. Andrew Wittmann : So I was going to ask here on some of the capitalization, I guess, of NewCo and some of the cash costs to spin off. So could you, Kevin, comment on what you think a realistic range for cash cost to effectuate the spin would be as well as your thoughts on where the debt would sit I would guess that you'd keep them ratable or similar leverage based on the relative EBITDA. But I guess from a practical standpoint, I guess, NewCo probably gets spun out at with no debt and then would borrow and then pay like a cash dividend back to RemainCo to achieve the capitalization. So kind of a lot in here but I guess there's another aspect to it which is as you're ranging new debt in today's debt markets, what's the net impact on interest expense from having to recapitalize a new company? Kevin Berryman : So look, I'll make my first comment in response to your detailed questions is we remain committed to the Jacobs RemainCo that it's going to be investment-grade rating. So I think that gives you a ground post that you can certainly evaluate what the potential options may or may not look like. The second thing I would say is we're a little bit too early in the process. We have kept this to a very small group of executives and team members up until this point in time. And now we are -- as we publicly announced, we're going to go through a very detailed, thoughtful, disciplined process that will answer all of these questions. I do think that the way we would characterize the leverage factors, they're going to be appropriate relative to the businesses in which they are. So I think I'll just leave it there and I think you can interpret what that may or may not mean. But we think ultimately that there is an ability to have a stand-alone organization that will -- that is now CMS which is going to be -- have an ability to be quite successful longer term and people in places and PA and divergent as well as the RemainCo. Andrew Wittmann : Got it. And then I guess just for my follow-up. I think I heard on your revenue outlook for Divergent that you're expecting good acceleration. Maybe I missed it but did you have a comment on the second half revenue performance that you're expecting for CMS? I think previously, this business also was expected to see an acceleration. I just wanted to make sure I heard your latest on that one. Kevin Berryman : Well, look, we didn't really comment about CMS, although I think what I would focus on in CMS is really more about the margin, sequential improvement which we think is really important as we get the business back to that level of 8% for the full year which is what we characterized. And so perhaps I'll leave it there because we didn't really talk about the CMS numbers; still growing. Operator : And Mr. Pragada, I'd like to turn things back to you, sir, for any closing comments this morning. Robert Pragada : Yes, thank you. It's exciting times ahead. We're really looking forward to what the future brings. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call and we'll be very close to the market continue -- as things continue to develop and progress. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Jacob Solutions second quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast. We'd like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great rest of your day. Goodbye.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Jonathan Evans : Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide two of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Kevin Berryman. We are also joined by our incoming CFO, Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our third quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. And Claudia will provide an overview of separation-related activities. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Before I hand it over to Bob, I want to address some reporting changes that were made in the quarter. We consistently review our reporting practices to be aligned with best practices for our industry and SEC guidelines. After review, we have decided to amend our name and convention for revenue, excluding pass-through costs from net revenue to adjusted net rent revenue. Note, this is simply a name change intended to make the non-GAAP nature of this measure more prominent and does not impact measurement. In addition, after an internal review, we have made certain minor adjustments to pass-through revenues in certain prior periods to properly reflect amounts that had not been previously included. As a result, in the materials that we have included in the appendix to this presentation, we have adjusted People & Places adjusted net revenue for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Note, this change has been deemed as immaterial has no impact on our reported earnings, operating income or cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2023 business performance. Turning to Slide four. I'd like to begin by recognizing the continued commitment and extraordinary talent of our 60,000-plus teammates here at Jacobs. I've now been in the CEO seat for over six months and as I spend time with our clients and our people, I continue to be both inspired and appreciative of the dedication and world-class expertise they bring to some of the world's toughest challenges. Now more than ever, our communities require the brightest and best minds to step forward with innovative and technology-enabled solutions to drive better outcomes. I'm proud of all that we do to play our part to enhance and serve those communities. Firstly, I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business before I move on to our third quarter results. The company continues to make significant progress on the activities associated with the intended separation. In addition, following the announcement, there has been positive interest from multiple outside parties. We are currently evaluating this interest consistent with our commitment to maximize shareholder value. As previously communicated, a spin-off, which is subject to customary conditions, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2024. Let me reiterate, we are laser-focused on maximizing value for all of our stakeholders. As we progress towards the separation of CMS, our teams continue to work tirelessly to stand up both companies for independent success. In the process, we have identified a number of operational enhancements that we believe will propel each company to greater heights in the future. Consequently, we believe that fiscal year 2024 will be a year of optimization and acceleration. Turning to Slide five, on optimization, we see significant potential to enhance our cost structure and our operating model to continue to drive efficiencies and lead our industry, not just in size but in profitability. This will unleash a more cohesive Jacobs that leverages our digital platforms, consulting and advisory and global delivery model to accelerate our value-creating growth. On acceleration, for many years, we have highlighted investments in growth, in our people, platforms and technology-enabled solutions. We've invested behind and proudly managed a portfolio aligned with secular megatrend, critical infrastructure, water scarcity, sustainability, re-shoring and energy transition. Our clients need us now more than ever, and we are delivering. Jacobs is driving higher growth, higher margin, differentiated expertise and solutions. Our addressable market is growing, and we are already capitalizing on these opportunities. Turning to Slide six and Q3; I am pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. Notably, our growth is entirely organic. And we continue to drive improving cash conversion, a hallmark of our business model, allowing us to invest behind our growth accelerators, climate response, data solutions and consulting and advisory. Our People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 9% year-over-year and operating profit up 13% year-over-year. Kevin will detail the significant growth we're experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see broad-based green shoots with a gross margin backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top line, which provides visibility and confidence in our expectations that growth will persist at current rates. CMS remains a pillar of stability. CMS Q3 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year, and operating profit increased 12% behind 36 bps of margin expansion. CMS continued to book awards at an over 70% win rate. Its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in fiscal 2024 and minimal forecasted re-compete pursuits. As a result, the Jacobs team is advancing required flight software and hardware testing for the Artemis II missions scheduled for December 2024, the second scheduled flight of the program and notably its first crude mission. In early July, an integrated team of NASA and Jacobs personnel at Marshall Space Center successfully completed the initial phase of formal qualification testing for the Artemis II SLS flight software, a very exciting time for all involved. PA Consulting sales and backlog once again increased year-over-year, led by sales in the energy and defense sectors. Margins stabilized in Q3 above 21%, supported by strategic cost actions taken during the quarter, and we continue to have the highest confidence in our talented management team. PA continues to see increasing opportunities in energy transition. For example, we assisted a leading offshore wind developer in securing a fixed price electricity contract in Ireland's first offshore wind auction. PA is also seeing significant interest in its digital expertise from clients who are looking to assess AI-related impacts and opportunities for their businesses. As an example, a leading cybersecurity client hired PA to support the development of a comprehensive strategic plan with specific focus on understanding the power of AI and mitigating cyber threats. Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 72% year-over-year growth in operating profit. During the quarter, we won another competitive pursuit with the Ohio Department of Transportation to extend Streetlights Software-as-a-Service offering. Streetlight already provides statewide modeling and traffic analysis, safety programming and support for large scale planning efforts. This new contract is for congestion and freight management functionality to support the state's carbon emission reduction efforts. Turning to Slide seven; looking across the Jacobs enterprise, we continue to see considerable and geographically diverse opportunities in our greater than $2 billion water business. From water reuse to treatment to drinking water coupled with our innovative project delivery offering, demand remains robust. During Q3, we saw a healthy growth behind water scarcity-related pursuits. For example, scope increases and new wins with our long-standing partnership with the Singapore Public Utilities Board. Underinvestment in future proofing needs also -- proofing needs also continue to be a major driver. In the U.S., we have been selected by a large Southern California utility agency to provide program management and strategic funding advisory services to create a more sustainable, drought-resilient local water supply for one of the largest groundwater storage base. And in New Zealand, we were awarded an extension and expansion of our central interceptor program, the country's largest ever wastewater project. We also continue to see environmental and sustainability projects. For example, we landed a marquee $450 million award from the U.S. EPA's Great Lake National Program Office and RegionFind Super Fund to provide environmental, technical management services and associated infrastructure tasks in the Great Lakes area. We also see continuing momentum in legislation and aligned work. IIJA aligned wins continue to accelerate versus the year ago period. And for example, we were awarded the Brent Spence Bridge, an iconic connector of economic development between Ohio and Kentucky which has been postponed for many years. And we continue to closely support the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority in their successful low and no emissions grant application. And subsequent subsequently performed delivery services to provide energy-efficient buses and charging infrastructure. Turning to Slide eight, in summary, we are extremely well poised for this strong growth across sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record for operational excellence. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob, and let me turn right to Slide nine for a financial overview of our third quarter results. Third quarter gross revenue grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7.5%. Adjusted net revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 25%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to PA Consulting. I will provide additional comments regarding our segments later in my remarks. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue was 14.7%, over 100 basis points better sequentially and year-over-year more than offsetting the lower gross margin; Costs were well managed due to discipline and actions taken, and we are still targeting G&A as a percentage of adjusted net revenue to stay well below 16% for the full fiscal year 2023, improving upon the 16.2% figure realized in 2022. GAAP operating profit was $270 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, other transaction and separation-related costs and restructuring efforts of $38 million and a $1.4 million noncash charge related to decreasing our real estate footprint aligned to our future work strategy. The other transaction, separation related and restructuring costs of $38 million included three distinct types of costs. The first represents approximately 45% of the $38 million and relates to a restructuring initiative in our PA Consulting business to rightsize the cost structure to align with the company's end market demands. The second cost represents approximately 35% of the amount and is associated with our initial advisory and other costs associated with the separation of the CMS. Third bucket, which is approximately 20% of the $34 million, is related to the cost of noncash PA contingent equity-based agreement associated with the PA transaction structure and other miscellaneous incentive costs that were considered part of the total consideration of previous transactions. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $361 million, up over 10% year-over-year. Our total discrete items for the year, excluding the new CMS separation efforts, will remain at the $100 million figure that we have forecasted for the year, well below the total figure of $185 million in 2022. Of this $100 million figure, the total noncash impairment costs will total approximately $45 million. Such impairments will be largely complete as we exit this fiscal year. Of course, as we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the planned separation of CMS. I would let Claudia provide more detail in her prepared remarks. Our adjusted operating profit to adjusted net revenue was 10.7%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the review by reporting segment. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles; $0.20 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, a $0.01 noncash impairment charge related to reducing our real estate footprint; and a $0.05 adjustment to align to our projected annual adjusted tax rate. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.82, down 2% year-over-year. Importantly, while down versus the year ago period, 2022 benefited from the $0.08 cost investment gain associated with the sale of our WatchGuard investment. In addition, in 2023, incremental interest costs of $0.07 have reduced EPS this quarter versus the year ago figure. The net impact is a $0.15 headwind in EPS year-over-year. As we look ahead to our full year forecast, with Bob providing an overview of our guidance range at the end of our call, we expect Q4 EPS to show healthy growth versus the year ago period. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $355 million and was down 2% year-over-year, representing 10.5% of adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 3% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1x, with our gross margin and backlog, again, improving year-over-year. Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10 for Q3. People & Places Solutions continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 9% year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Growth was consistently strong across almost all business units, led by advanced facilities. Europe continues to see some pressure, but was more than offset by strength in the Middle East, Americas and Asia Pacific. Backlog was flat year-over-year, although gross margins in the backlog was up 8%, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of work Q3 operating profit was up 13% and 15% in constant currency, driven by strong growth leverage and solid G&A management, resulting in operating profit as a percentage of adjusted net revenue of 14.4%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. We expect year-over-year improvement and strong people in places operating profit margin and growth to continue in Q4. Our Advanced Facilities unit, which represents approximately 1/4 of our People & Places revenue and benefits from investments in the life sciences, semiconductor and electric vehicle supply chains, posted at sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite macroeconomic crosscurrents, our Tier 1 customers continue to pursue robust spending plans underpinned by long-term demand drivers. Our backlog and sales pipeline remains healthy, and we continue to be encouraged about the outlook for this segment. Our People & Places Americas unit reported Q3 operating profit with 10%-plus growth as legislation-driven backlog begins to convert at higher rates. For example, IIJA-related profit is trending nearly 20% ahead of our current plan. We remain enthusiastic about our overall growth opportunities with double-digit pipeline growth led by water, cities and places and energy and power. Our Q3 international business, revenue and operating profit were up high single digits year-over-year as Asia Pacific and the Middle East continue to be a bright spot in the portfolio, supported by Giga Cities and strategic water pursuits. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions; Q3 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. CMS has benefited from an over 70% win rate year-to-date. And as a result, backlog is up 12% year-over-year. The sales pipeline also remains very healthy as CMS positions for strategic growth in its core focus areas of space, defense, energy and technology solutions. CMS operating profit and OP margin were both up sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our previous guidance, with operating profit up 12% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margins to approximately 8% on a full year basis as we convert on an IDIQ pipeline of higher margin opportunities. Moving to Divergent Solutions; adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year as we remain focused on higher-margin contracts. This trend should be expected to continue near term before an acceleration in coming quarters as our investments in sales and technology offerings bear fruit. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 9.5%, a sequential improvement as compared to Q2's underlying normalized margin when adjusting for the benefit of a large license sale in the prior quarter. We have increasing confidence that the underlying margin momentum over the past two quarters is durable. And as a result, we continue to expect divergence, quarterly margins to approach 10% in Q4. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 3% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, an indication of the company's relative performance to peers driven by their value to clients in a tough economic environment. PA's Q3 operating profit margin was 21.2%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and up over 15% year-over-year. PA management continues to take action to improve utilization, and we expect OP margins to be 20%-plus for the medium term with potential for longer-term improvement. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $62 million in Q3, consistent with our guidance. We expect that our quarterly run rate may remain elevated at or above the recent level for a short period of time. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model focused on infrastructure and advanced facility. Claudia will provide her perspective in her prepared remarks. Turning to Slide 11 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, we posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings despite temporary restructuring and separation-related efforts. Free cash flow was $290 million, resulting in a year-to-date 127% conversion of net income into free cash flow. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver at or above our anticipated 100% recorded and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the full year. Regarding the deployment of our free cash flow, we remain agile and opportunistic in repurchasing shares. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in shares at an average price of $115. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.1 billion and gross debt of $3.2 billion, resulting in just over $2.1 billion of net debt. Our Q3 net debt to 2023 expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade credit profile both today and as a more focused business post our announced CMS separation. As of the end of Q3, approximately 56% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail related to our debt maturities, interest rate derivatives and quarterly interest expense. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which increased 13% year-over-year and will be paid on August 25. Before I formally transition the CFO role to Claudia on August 14, I wanted to say a few words on my last earnings call. It has been an honor working with such talented colleagues and witnessing our collective accomplishments over the past 8.5 years. During my tenure, I have observed growth and transformation within our company and I am immensely proud of the achievements we have made together. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the Board, leadership team and dedicated employees for their unwavering support, passion and commitment to excellence; to our investors, your trust has been instrumental in our success. While my time as CFO comes to an end, I remain confident in the company's bright future and have no doubt that the company is in good hands with Claudia in the CFO role. I also look forward to supporting Bob in my new role as a special adviser going forward. I will now turn the call over to Claudia. Claudia Jaramillo : Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 12, I have now been with Jacobs for just over one year and look forward to formally succeeding Kevin next week. He has been a superb partner throughout this transition period and I feel privileged to help lead this company at such an important inflection point in its history. As EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development, I've overseen the rollout of our strategic stand-up management office at the center of the CMS separation. Our goal is to continue to serve our clients without interruption, optimize both companies operating models and to effectively manage risk associated with the separation. Due to the hard and tireless work of our teams, we have made significant progress towards effective We can also confidently reinforce that we intend to eliminate separation-related stranded costs. In addition, we have identified value levers that we believe can lead to continued productivity gains at independent Jacobs. Last quarter, we outlined independent Jacobs target operating profit margins of 12% from separation alone. Yet, we believe there is further upside, and it is our goal to further expand margins post separation. We'll have more to say about that over time. But one of the most exciting aspects of the separation is the opportunity to drive further growth and profitability with the streamlined Jacobs. Jacobs has a recognized sustainable business model with a strong foundation that aligns purpose with both growth and value creation. I, like the rest of the Jacobs team, am absolutely committed to Jacobs' purpose-led vision. Our vision underpins our commitment to deliver superior results for our shareholders, employees and broader stakeholders. I look forward to meeting more of our employees, clients and investors in the weeks and months to come, as I assume the CFO position. Thank you, and I will turn the call over to Bob. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 13, due to strong year-to-date performance and forward indicators, we reiterate our outlook for FY '23 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and adjusted EPS to $7.25 to $7.45. We will provide guidance for fiscal year 2024 in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. Turning to Slide 14, in closing, I would like to express my tremendous appreciation for Kevin's contribution to the transformational success of our company over the last 8-plus years. Kevin is a great personal friend and has been a fantastic business partner. I am privileged to have his continued support as my special adviser. We are very fortunate to have Claudia as a critical leader on our team. I look forward to her continued accomplishments and contributions building on her success to date. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Claudia. Jonathan. Bob. And well done, Kevin. Thank you. Bob, I'm encouraged about the continued backlog margin improvement. Maybe you could share a little bit about where that margin improvement this quarter is coming from? And as you look at the pipeline and some of the recent bookings, how that may play through as we move into 2024 and the mix, given the -- either the three biggest if you want to include CMS on that margin improvement expectation for 2024? Robert Pragada : Yes. Mike, thanks. I'd say right now, the margin improvement is coming from a couple of key drivers. First is around the mix. We are finding a larger part of our portfolio in the consulting advisory component. And when I say that, I'm not saying exclusively PA, that's across the board, even on our infrastructure engagements right now, we're hitting jobs right at the front end where kind of got a higher-end, higher-margin consultative service component. So mix is definitely a driver. The second component on current margin expansion is around the operational discipline that we've been working on for quite a while. And so our project delivery as well as the stability in our offering has continued to evolve. Moving forward, as far as the continued expansion, the digital enablement is starting to come through. You can't quite see it just yet, but it's becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and this is broad. This is broad across the enterprise. And then the global delivery model. We've been talking about that for several quarters, but that global delivery model is paying some real fruit, and we see that continuing to rise moving forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Kevin, thanks for all your help. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : So you guys mentioned that you had interested parties looking at CMS. To the extent you can, could you give us any more color regarding the interest? Is it from strategic? What's the time frame for when you might make a decision regarding a potential sale? And could you give us any more detail on how to think about CMS' tax basis and how you consider that tax leakage versus a potential spin? Robert Pragada : Yes. Andy, unfortunately, we can't. That's -- right now, I've just mentioned that the interest is strong. We're evaluating. And we can't go into any more detail on that. I apologize. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's fine, Bob. So then let me ask a different question. You -- People & Places growth moving forward. You mentioned P&PS adjusted net revenue up 9% year-over-year. I think your main peers suggest morning they're also seeing some acceleration in fiscal funding in the U.S. Do you see IIJA related funding continue to accelerate from here? And do you think you could keep up or accelerate the kind of growth you recorded in Q3 into '24? Robert Pragada : We do. We do. The IIJA component is really kind of in the -- I'd still say it's in the early innings, but we're seeing that flow through Andy, we actually got in front of that with the grant component and assistance in the grant applications. That now, coupled with the formulaic based funding that's flowing, has really helped. So yes, we do see that legislation-driven funding, not just IIJA, but also the other legislation that's been passed and that moving forward is going to continue to be a big piece. The other thing that it's done is it has -- it's kind of stimulated other legislative acts around the world. I think there's an EU Chips Act that we've now seen some of the components to as well as infrastructure stimulus coming out in other parts of the world. So kind of the world is getting behind this. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Nice quarter. And congrats, Kevin, and thanks for all your help as well throughout the year. I guess my first question, understanding the margin story that you're talking about consulting mix, project delivery, digital enablement. But as you, depending what happens with CMS and we have the new Jacobs, is there a greater opportunity on the cost side, just to sort of restructure streamline costs as well as what you're seeing on the project delivery or mix side? Just wondering if there's a cost story there.  And then my second question, it was nice to see the strong cash flow in the repurchase in the quarter here. Can you talk about sort of shorter-term capital allocation priorities, share repurchase the way that investors should continue to think about things with acquisitions being more in the sideline? Robert Pragada : Sure. Go ahead, Claudia. Claudia Jaramillo : So thank you, Jamie. On the first one, the cost opportunities. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see the opportunity -- day 1 is just to start. And with a more streamlined strategy and the business model, we see lots of opportunities for more efficiencies as we can also leverage more our global delivery platform. So efficiencies, more focused strategy and the agility that, that will bring. So lots of opportunities on the cost optimization front. On the capital allocation structure, we are -- we said it before, we are very happy with the opportunities we have, our portfolio. We are focusing on our organic growth, and we see it. We've building this portfolio over time. We see the opportunities to invest in ourselves to continue delivering this growth. So we prioritize that and returning excess cash to our shareholders. So those are the priorities and all that really on a risk-adjusted basis. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Hi, good morning, everyone and Kevin, congratulations. I think in your nearly 9 years, the stock has nearly quadrupled. So well done, and Claudia congratulations again. . Claudia Jaramillo : Thank you. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if you could just ask on advanced facilities just based on the disclosures, it looks like that's about 1/4 of People & Places at this point, so a really good performance so far. Can you just talk about, given the backlog in that business, is there a runway for that portion of the portfolio to be 30% or more of People & Places over the next year or 2? Just if you could touch on the backlog, Bob, if you don't mind? Robert Pragada : Sure. Yes, Jerry, that's a great way of looking at it. The short answer is yes. We see it as a larger part of our portfolio moving forward. Backlog is robust. And I guess what really gives us some confidence in the continued growth, and Kevin mentioned that it was -- it's been six quarters, but just kind of step back, we've been in growth mode in this business for probably the better part of the last four years, is what's happening in the industry You talked about re-shoring, but specifically in life sciences, and it's been well published, the level of technology coming out was really driven by oncology in the past, but now we're seeing things with regards to obesity and then the obesity drugs that are having a positive effect on heart disease, we're seeing that in our pipeline and in our backlog with the Tier 1 customers that we've been doing work for ages. That coupled with the Chips Act and all that's going on in the EV world, we got -- the tailwinds would give us confidence that, that is going to be a bigger percentage of our portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open. Bert Subin : Hey, good morning. and congratulations both Kevin and Claudia. Robert Pragada : Thanks, Bert. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bert. Bert Subin : Maybe just a follow-up on that question, Bob, if you think that Advanced Facility is going to become a larger part of the business and the rest of the business is sort of already on track to grow high single digits, at least in the medium term. Does that lead you to believe that, that business can continue growing double digits for a period of time? Robert Pragada : I think right now, the indications are, yes. But the visibility that we have, we have visibility from a project standpoint probably six to nine months out. What we're basing our confidence in is the continued trends in technology. So the short answer is yes. Bert Subin : Got it. And then just a broader P&PS question. Can you just sort of walk us through what sequentially changes, I guess, as we think about the fourth quarter? I know FX will become relative tailwind, but the guidance has seemed to imply that margins remain at or above sort of the targeted range that you guys have out there with sales potentially also stepping up. So is that in your view, sort of largely driven by IIJA ramp you're starting to see projects come through or is there something else that's posting that? Robert Pragada : Go ahead, Kevin. Kevin Berryman : Look, I would say it's a variety of things : good execution, certainly good growth as it relates to those businesses that we've already discussed in our prepared remarks. And so I think it positions us well to end the year well and ultimately continue to drive forward in 2024. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions and, Kevin, I just wanted to say a very impressive CFO tenure. Congratulations. I wanted to press Claudia on the efficiencies and streamlining comments a little bit more. And I realize it's early days, but I'm just curious where we should expect to see that enhancement? Is it kind of across all the segments? Is it more so in the corporate costs? And then also, Kevin, I think you made a comment about the corporate costs remaining elevated for a short amount of time. So I wondered if that run rate is expected to step down going into next year? Some clarity there would also be helpful. Claudia Jaramillo : Yes. Thank you, Sean. So first, I want to say the work is under with way, right? So part of the separation is understanding the entanglements and all that. So just -- and we will be sharing a lot more as we progress in the process. So to explain it is, one, there are many functions or tasks and processes that you have when you put different factors together, and so that applies to different functions. Is it support functions? Is it workflows and so on? So Sean, you can think of finance put in numbers to that, is it HR, is it the delivery model and so on. So as you simplify and streamlined, you see those efficiencies also the ability to share data depending on where you operate. So it really goes at multiple levels. And as I said, we will be sharing that as we progress in the process and the work is underway. And it's a very well structured process and the standup management office that we have. To give you an idea, it's around 25 work streams that we have all the different functions and in operations and everywhere where we operate. And as I said before, one key element of that is our very strong model of the global delivery platform. So that allows us to extract further efficiencies as we maximize the use of that platform. Sean Eastman : Okay. And my follow-up would be for Bob. I think it was relative to P&PS, but I think you made a comment about being able to continue to grow at current rates. So I just wanted to flesh out as much as we can relative to the top line growth expectations for RemainCo on a go forward? Robert Pragada : Sure. We stuck to the [ 6% to 9% ] long-term top line growth rate, and that was what my comment was referring to. And right now, we've got some nice tailwinds behind us. So the higher end of that range is where we are. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with AllianceBernstein. Your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi. Good morning, guys. And I just want to extend my congrats to you, Kevin. So I want to spend some time on the water business. I think you talked about it being a $2 billion business. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of like a pipeline from a pipeline perspective? How to think about the growth rate and margin relative to the broader P&PS targets? Robert Pragada : Sure, Chad. The pipeline within the water sector, and I'm talking globally, is probably the fastest-growing pipeline that we have in the business, and that is in the 30%, 40% year-on-year growth in the pipeline. So very robust, being driven by a infrastructure EPA regulations in the states as well as just the need for water, the drought infested areas of not just the U.S. and all that's happening around climate change and then our climate response is driving the need. This need is being funded in a whole variety of sources. I mean these are user fees, these are supplemented by certain government actions that are happening around the world. So all of kind of the drivers are strong and they're not going away. The need is high and governments and state and municipal areas are standing behind it. So we're -- and we're right in the middle of it. And as you know, Chad, we've been a leader in that sector for decades, and that's really coming through. Chad Dillard : That's helpful. And how should we think about just the growth rate of that business and margins relative to the broader P&PS segment? Robert Pragada : Yes. I'd say margins right now are above kind of the mean margins within the sector today. I think there's some room there. And I think that it's going to continue to be a major part of our overall enterprise-wide portfolio moving forward. Chad Dillard : That's helpful. And then I think you talked about some restructuring PA. Just trying to get a sense for how to think about any future costs? How to think about margin benefits? And when you think we'll actually kind of get the full run rate of those cost saving initiatives? Kevin Berryman : Are you talking specifically on PA or what... Robert Pragada : Just PA. Kevin Berryman : Just PA? Robert Pragada : Yes. Kevin Berryman : Well, look, the cost actions have been taken. So we're expecting on a go-forward basis that, that will improve the margins. we have been talking about utilization and rightsizing the business for a while. And ultimately, the management team got to the point where they decided to proactively go after it as opposed to grow into it. And so we're excited about the ability for that to have taken place. Really good work by the management team. And so that run rate is effectively being embedded into the business going forward. Robert Pragada : Yes. And sustainable. Kevin Berryman : And sustainable. Robert Pragada : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning Kevin, best wishes. I wanted to zoom into the P&PS profit growth. You were talking before, Bob, about the top line at the high end. Just about the 13% year-over-year profit growth in Q3. Where do you see that going? Is that -- I mean it was still double digit, but it was a slowdown from 21% in the quarter before. So I guess, is this sort of normalizing into a low double-digit trajectory from here or is this -- do you think there's an actual reacceleration here? Just trying to think about how to frame the expectation for that profit growth in Q4 and into 2024? Robert Pragada : Yes. Steve, I think that from a sustained standpoint, we've been vocal that we could drive double-digit growth from a bottom line perspective. I think there was an earlier question around mix. So we're going to have events where we might get some pops in the business. But I'd say on a sustained go-forward basis that double-digit growth in the sustaining area where it's at now is the way to think about it. Steven Fisher : Okay. That's helpful. And then a bigger picture question here. Bob, I'm curious how you're managing the business with regard to the broader economic outlook? There's clearly lots of talk about different types of landings for the economy. What are you planning for at the moment? You're about seven to eight weeks away from the start of our next fiscal year, so how is that affecting the decisions you're making today? Obviously, you're sort of been proactive in streamlining operations, but curious if the different economic landings are factoring into your decision-making 1 way or the other? Robert Pragada : Yes. I'd say a couple of things, Steve. One is that we have been very deliberate over the course of several years. And Kevin and I have talked a lot about it over the last years and now you're hearing Claudia say the same thing is that we feel comfortable of those end markets that we are acutely focused in on, have got strong tailwinds. Wouldn't -- nobody is going to say that they are resilient of recession. But those tailwinds aren't going anywhere and are probably less tied to inflation than other consumer-driven type of areas. And even in the area that we have some exposure to the broader consumer, these are now in the world of life sciences and chips and broad-based manufacturing that is tied to geopolitical as well as geoeconomic kind of reshaping of the world. So from a portfolio standpoint, we feel strong. And wherever the economy is going, those tailwinds, we feel confident in. The other is around our operations and our cost posture. We're doing a lot right now on the operating model and how we run the company and how we go to market, and we're using this inflection point with the separation of CMS to even accelerate that component, talk a little bit about in the prepared remarks. So that's creating more internal resilience. And then the last I would say is something that Claudia spoke about earlier, and that's cost optimization. We have known us -- Steve, you've known us for a long time, for decades, we have been a company that has been very acutely focused in on cost and cost management and that's in our DNA, and we're going to continue to do that as we continue to look at the leaner structure prospect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Your line is open. Andrew Wittmann : Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. And Kevin, it's been a pleasure. I guess I wanted to ask about some of the cash restructuring costs. It looks like they're down the new outlook for them. The split of cash is up a little bit, noncash real estate down a little bit. I suppose that's probably related to the $17 million for PA taken in the quarter on cash restructuring. But I guess there's kind of 2 questions that come out of this. One is, do you think that this round of restructuring charges can flow through to the profit line, recognizing in the past, the various restructuring programs we've had in the past have generally been reinvested for growth? And the second question would be, given that '23 is a little bit higher on the cash restructuring costs, what do you think the outlook for '24 could be? Obviously, the CMS been or the potential sale is a big factor, but do you think that the costs will be up or down versus the roughly $55 million of cash cost that you expect to recognize in 2023? Robert Pragada : Kevin, go ahead. Kevin Berryman : Maybe -- thanks, Andy. But let me take a stab. As Claudia suggested in her prepared remarks, we're working through that right now as we speak, relative to the CMS separation efforts. And so it's premature to really give any perspective on that. I think the bottom line relative to your cash comment for 2023 is basically correct. And so at the end of the day, I think the other point that you asked, is it going to be -- it's going to drop to the bottom line or be reinvested? I think that Claudia has made it very clear in her comments that the stranded cost opportunities are, we believe, of substance, and that's going to take a lot of hard work to get after it. But I think we'll leave it there. And fundamentally, I think what the plan will be is that we'll give some additional color, Claudia and Bob will give some additional color when we talk in our Q4 earnings release and outlook for 2024. Claudia Jaramillo : And what I would add to that, Andy, is we use the cash conversion as a key metric for us. So it's really important to show is the cash conversion and we have shown the strong cash conversion. So all these numbers is to help our investors understand the numbers. Hopefully, that helps to analyze the numbers. But the cash conversion remains very strong, and we are very committed to maintaining that strong delivery. Andrew Wittmann : Got it. I guess for my follow-up question, I would just ask about Divergent here. I heard the comments for the fourth quarter. This business has always had kind of an implicit kind of ramp that you believe that some of the contracts that you're on will start contributing more significantly. I guess the question is, what's the visibility you have into that ramp? And do you still believe that, that revenue ramp can lead to better fixed cost coverage and push margins up more materially even than you've realized in the last couple of quarters, which has been notable for sure? Robert Pragada : Yes, Andy, we do. And part of that is, if you look -- if you kind of dissect Divergent, as we've talked about in previous quarters, the area that's growing at the fastest rate are those platforms that we've developed around transportation and water. And those are growing very fast. Now the reason why we're not necessarily seeing that at the top line is because these are platforms that are driving growth at the bottom line for Divergent and creating margin expansion in P&PS, part of that digital enablement of an earlier question, too. So from a bottom line standpoint, the answer would be, yes, we see that visibility, and it's being driven by infrastructure, transportation and water, and we're getting those platforms now into the energy sector as well. So more to follow on how that's going to continue to catalyze P&PS. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sabahat Khan : Okay. Great. Just, I guess, on some of the infrastructure stimulus money that you said you've seen so far. I'm just curious which end markets that's concentrated and sort of where are you winning some work? And then -- and as you look ahead even to kind of the next 12 to 18 months, which end markets, you think we'll probably see more of the money, whether it's IIJA, IRA or the chipset. I'm just curious how it's flowing by end market at this point? Robert Pragada : Sure. Sabahat, it's really the early phases of the early innings have been probably indexed more towards transportation. So we're seeing more in that. But now we're kind of starting to see the front end of different -- I mentioned the New Orleans job where we're doing some green fleeting of the bus systems and the other transport. So under the guides of transport, with now some clean energy components that are tied to it, and we'll start to spill over in some IRA application as well. I would say on the larger, whether it be some of the lead-free work or -- I'm sorry, the lead pipe and the lead topic work as well as some additional support of some of the larger water infrastructure, we would expect to see that coming up, too. So transport first, moving into clean energy and the energy component of transport and then down the road water. Sabahat Khan : Great. And then just more of a housekeeping-type question on the cost improvements that you've talked about on P&PS. I guess just trying to understand, is that -- is the kind of the -- just going full throttle on the plan tied to the timing of the sale or separation of CMS business? Or is that something that's ongoing and we should see a meaningful benefit in your fiscal '24 numbers? Just trying to understand if those two events are tied in terms of timing of when you execute and the savings that we see in fiscal '24. Claudia Jaramillo : Yes. So the PA comment is really focused on PA and it's more aligned with the end markets that PA has. So they have a lot of strength in specific markets and then is more aligned the resources with that strength in some markets and then what they see in the other markets that are more flat. So that's really PA related. And then CMS is more the connectivity with -- between CMS and the rest of the company and the comments that Bob made about our efforts looking at our operating model and all the efficiency gains and productivity that we see as we have cost reductions with a more streamlined strategy and execution. Robert Pragada : In the 2024, Sabahat, which I think is the last part with P&PS, the answer is yes. Sabahat Khan : Thinking about the savings from P&PS. Okay. So we should see them in '24? Robert Pragada : Yes. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Bob Pragada. Robert Pragada : All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining and look forward to continued growth and success. Kevin, thank you so much, and welcome Claudia to the future. Thanks, everyone. Look forward to talking to you next time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Evans, Vice President of Corporate Development, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jonathan Evans : Thank you, good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. Our 10-K will be filed later today. I would like to refer you to slide two of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Turning to the agenda on slide three. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities, then summarizing highlights from our fourth quarter results. Claudia will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Finally, Bob will provide details on our updated outlook along with closing remarks and then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn it over to our CEO, Bob Pragada. Bob Pragada : Thanks, Jonathan. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 business performance and 2024 outlook. Our team has shown remarkable strength, adaptability, and dedication and continuing to deliver outstanding results to our clients. I'm proud of our people for continuing to drive our culture of carrying to new heights. Over the past couple of quarters, we have shared our intention to simplify our business model, optimize our cost structure, and accelerate profitable growth and margin expansion. Today marks a key turning point as we boldly move forward. I want to provide an update on our previously announced intent to separate the CMS business on slide four before I move on to our fourth quarter results. As we communicated, following a robust evaluation of all opportunities, we are excited to announce the creation of a new leading government services player. Jacobs will be separating our industry-leading Government Services businesses, Critical Mission Solutions, and the Cyber & Intelligence Unit of Divergent Solutions by the way of the spin-off to Jacobs' shareholders and then combining those assets with Amentum, through a merger which has been structured as a Reverse Morris Trust. This combination is intended to be largely tax-free for Jacobs shareholders. Turning to slide five. The combination creates a combined government technology services leader with an approximately $13 billion in revenue and approximately $1.1 billion of combined adjusted EBITDA, including $50 million to $70 million of net synergies expected to be realized by year two. Jacobs shareholders will own 51%, and Jacobs will retain a stake equal to between 7.5% to 12% of the combined company based on achievement of operating profit targets prior to close. Jacobs will also receive a $1 billion cash dividend, subject to customary adjustments, as well as an additional value through the disposition of our retained stake within 12 months of closing. As part of our continued separation efforts, we concluded it was the best, it was best to include the majority of our Divergent Solutions business including the Cyber & Intelligence unit in the separation perimeter, owing to the strategic synergies, shared costs, and operational overlap with CMS. We will retain the infrastructure-related software assets of Divergent Solutions, given their strong strategic fit with our Critical Infrastructure, Advanced Facilities, and PA Consulting businesses. We believe this combination of two premium industry leaders, who share strong operating platforms, high-performance culture, and a breadth of expertise offer shareholders the best opportunity to realize long-term value. The combined business has the ability to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful cost synergies, added scale, and diverse end-market exposure, and is supported by secular growth trends. After a comprehensive review of all inbound inquiries, we believe the transaction is in the best interest of the company and our stakeholders. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Jacobs Board, as well as the financial sponsors of Amentum and is not subject to any other shareholder approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the second-half of fiscal year 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. For more details regarding the structure of the deal, I invite you to review the materials we published earlier. Moving to slide six, which shows our multi-year transformation. As part of this strategic separation, which results in a more focused Jacobs, we are concurrently announcing a cost optimization plan to be executed over the next 24-months, during which time we will target over 300 basis points of margin expansion, as compared to our as reported fiscal year 2023 results driving an expected adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025 for pro-forma Jacobs. Claudia will share more details in here prepared remarks. Post transaction, Jacobs will be a well-capitalized pure play critical infrastructure and sustainability leader with a strong balance sheet and significant growth potential. Fiscal 2023 marked records for revenue and free cash flow generation for Jacobs, and we look forward to 2024 as we begin to chart our path forward as two leading independent companies. Turning to slide seven and Q4, I'm pleased to report another record quarter as measured by both revenue and operating profit. I would like to once again reiterate that this growth is entirely organic. Strong cash conversion remains a hallmark of our business model and remain robust in Q4 allowing us to drive record fiscal year 2023 free cash flow in order to return capital to shareholders, while investing behind our growth accelerators, Climate Response, Data Solutions, and Consulting & Advisory. We recorded a 104% underlying free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income in FY 2023 on a record year of $837 million in free cash flow generation. We expect to generate greater than 100% underlying free cash flow conversion again in FY 2024, before the impact of restructuring transaction separation costs. Our underlying business and outlook remains very healthy and we continue to be excited about robust growth opportunities in all our end markets. Turning to slide eight, our People & Places line of business delivered accelerating top-line growth with adjusted net revenue up 11% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit up 12% year-over-year. Claudia will provide further details on the significant growth we're experiencing in our global business units. We continue to see widespread positive indicators with a gross profit in backlog growth of 8% year-over-year. Once again, our pipeline continues to grow faster than our top-line, which provides visibility and confidence, and our expectations that growth can persist at mid-to-high single-digits organically in FY '24. Looking back at FY '23, I want to highlight the significant achievements of our P&PS business with double-digit organic OP growth in every quarter. Water continues to be a pillar of our business, of the top 30 wins in the quarter none were in the water sector. Of those wins, we wanted to highlight two that showcase our digital and data capabilities. Firstly, at the City of Farmington New Mexico wastewater and surface water treatment plant, our data-enabled product, AquaDNA is a key part of the solution to provide resiliency efforts and improve energy efficiency. Secondly, for Boston Water & Sewer Commission, we are leveraging our AI model that analyzes assets that are most likely to fail, helping our clients create data-driven maintenance and replacement plants. In the Energy Transition space, Jacobs has been selected as the Program Manager for thyssenkrupp $2.5 billion effort to decarbonize its steel mill in Duisburg Germany, with a new green hydrogen power plant. The site is Europe's largest steel mill and the effort represents one of the largest industrial decarbonization projects worldwide. It is also a testament to the diversity of our expertise. In Transportation, our largest market, we continue to see broad-based momentum from IIJA related funding. Overall, IIJA related pipeline has increased approximately 20% year-over-year. In Q4, we were selected to lead and manage the 10-year renovation of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport international terminal. Emphasizing upgrades enhanced mobility and energy efficiency to position Seattle as a global tourism and business hub. Internationally, we continue to see high levels of activity in the Middle East. For example, in Climate Response, we are providing program management services to the Saudi Arabia National Center for Environmental Compliance. The work forms part of their ongoing environmental remediation program to repair damage to terrestrial and coastal environments. Our environmental expertise is truly global, and we continue to see a robust opportunity set related to our clients\u2019 climate-related challenges. In CMS, we performed very well in Q4 to cap off a great year. CMS Q4 revenue was 7% higher year-over-year and operating profit increased 26% behind a 128 bps of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remained robust with major award prospects in FY 2024 and minimal forecasted recompete pursuits. CMS was awarded a new project management resources framework contract with EDF Nuclear generation, licensee of eight nuclear power stations, which account for approximately 16% of the U.K.'s electricity output. PA Consulting continues to post strong results with 13% revenue growth and nearly 21% operating profit margins, despite a very challenging macro environment. While we remain cognizant of the weakness that some consulting peers are seeing, we continue to be pleased with strong operational performance delivered by the PA team. Utilization has improved, and during Q4 PA announced the appointment of Christian Norris as its new CEO. Christian formerly led PA's Life Sciences unit as a respected leader both internally and externally and has creative idea to take the Jacobs partnership with PA to new heights. For example, the power of our relationship is driving further opportunities as evidenced in our recent award to the Copenhagen Metro framework. Together with PA, we are bringing our enterprise digital tools, AI solutions, and deep knowledge of the rail sector to support the Copenhagen Metro as it continues to deliver modern future-ready infrastructure to meet the city's fast-growing population and urban travel demand. Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a strong quarter with 3% adjusted net revenue growth and 58% year-over-year growth in operating profit. In Divergent, we are a leader in space innovation, with the introduction of Mango Two, a revolutionary radio-frequency signal detection system that utilizes cutting-edge AI and machine-learning analytics emphasizing affordability. An example of the leading IP portfolio that reinforces independent CMS as a formidable player in this space arena. Turning to slide nine. In summary, we are extremely well-positioned for growth across all the sectors we serve, building off our established leadership position and proven track record of operational excellence. We are excited to turn the page on this next chapter in Jacobs' history, where we will be creating two leading independent companies. Looking at Slide 10, independent Jacobs is a leader in the majority of sectors in which we operate and a global leader in the overall industry. With today's announcement, we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to further simplify our business structure, optimize our cost base, and accelerate growth and margin improvement in the quarters and years ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail. Claudia Jaramillo : Thank you, Bob. Turning to slide 11 for a financial overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 10.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 8.9%. GAAP operating profit was $278 million for the quarter and included $52 million of amortization from acquired intangibles, $43 million of other transaction separated-related and restructuring costs, and $11 million non-cash charge related to decreasing our real-estate footprint. The other transaction separation-related and restructuring cost of $43 million are primarily related to advisory and other costs associated with the separation of CMS. As we go forward, our costs will now include expenses to be incurred in connection with the separation. Looking to fiscal year 2024, we expect to incur approximately $275 million in one-time costs related to the separation and associated cost optimization actions. These costs are largely unavoidable in a separation and transaction of this size, but I want to reiterate that post-separation, it will be a key focus of ours to minimize one-time adjustments inclusive of restructuring costs. Our adjusted operating margin was 11%, up 14 basis points year-over-year. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.25 per share, and included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles, $0.23 from transaction, restructuring, and other-related costs, a $0.05 non-cash impairment charge related to reducing our real-estate footprint, and a $0.10 adjustment to align to our annual adjusted effective tax rate. I refer you to slide 30 for more details on these adjustments. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.90, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $384 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing 11.1% of adjusted net revenue. The company's U.S. GAAP effective tax rate for continuing operations is 21% for the fiscal year 2023. Our U.S. GAAP and adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter and year include certain tax charges for deferred tax valuation allowances and audit assessments. In the fourth quarter, this amounts to an EPS impact of $0.06 per share, and as a result, fiscal year 2023 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects a 21.6% adjusted effective tax rate. Finally, backlog was up 4% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just over 1 times with our gross profit and backlog increasing 8% year-over-year. Moving to slide 12 for a brief recap of our full-year 2023 performance. Fiscal year gross revenue grew 10% year-over-year and net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion up significantly year-over-year, driven primarily by strong growth in gross profit while holding G&A relatively flat. GAAP EPS was $5.31 and adjusted EPS was $7.20, up 7% and 4% year-over-year, respectively. Adjusted operating profit grew 9%, and was up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Both revenue and adjusted operating profit increased year-over-year in all of our business segments. Operating profit margins expanded 20 basis points to 10.8%, driven by strong underlying performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.44 billion, up 5% and up 7% in constant currency. As a percentage of adjusted net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 10.8%. We expect modest adjusted operating margin expansion in fiscal 2024, driven by a combination of a higher-margin revenue mix and lower corporate G&A. However, we expect an even greater uplift in margins post-separation as we streamline our operating model and cost structure. On a trailing 12-month basis, fiscal year 2023 book-to-bill was approximately 1.1 times. Regarding the performance of our lines of business let's turn to slide 13 for Q4 performance and 14 for full-year performance. Starting with People & Places Solutions. P&PS continues to see solid momentum, delivering strong revenue and operating profit results. Q4 adjusted net revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Growth was consistently strong across all business units. Europe rebounded positively after being our weakest region year-to-date and we saw continued strength in the Middle East, Americas, and Asia-Pacific. Backlog was relatively flat sequentially, although gross margin and backlog was up 8% year-over-year as we continue to focus on improving business quality. P&PS Q4 operating profit was up 12% driven by strong growth, maintaining healthy gross margins and solid G&A management resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 15%, up 16 basis points year-over-year. For the full-year, adjusted operating profit was up 16% and adjusted operating margins were 14.6%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. Our P&PS Americas unit, which is our largest by revenue benefited from legislative drivers and a healthy state and local budgets continuing to book client spending. Internationally, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East continued to be bright spots in the portfolio, supported by Giga Cities and strategic water pursuits. Additionally, our European business showed a positive sequential growth. Now moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Q4 revenue was up 7% year-over-year and backlog is up 8% year-over-year and the business continues to demonstrate a strong win rate against a very healthy pipeline in all of its core focus areas. CMS operating margins were up 128 basis points year-over-year. For the full-year, margins were roughly flat, while operating profit increased 6% year-over-year. Notably, margins continued to rebound throughout the year as forecasted. Moving to Divergent Solutions, adjusted net revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q4, as we remain focused on portfolio improvement. We expect growth to accelerate from year-end levels as investments mature and lower-margin contracts roll out of backlog. Operating margins for the quarter was up 10.1% -- was 10.1%, a 50 basis point sequential improvement. Turning to PA Consulting. Revenue from PA was up 13% year-over-year in Q4 and increased 4% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. Based on booking trends, we expect revenue growth to show a positive trend in fiscal year 2024 while remaining cautious of the macro risk as the U.K. goes through an election cycle. PA's Q4 operating profit was 20.6%, up 122 basis points year-over-year and up 21% year-over-year. Utilization continues to improve, and we expect operating margins to be over 20% for the medium term. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $60 million in Q4, roughly flat sequentially and consistent with our guidance. In conjunction with the CMS separation, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of our cost structure under a more streamlined business model. However, despite initial cost actions taken, we will carry temporary costs associated with supporting the entirety of Jacobs, including the businesses to be separated. We estimate that we are carrying approximately $40 million in temporary cost throughout this transition period. This allows us the opportunity to reinforce our commitment to our clients and enhanced business resilience. We are confident that these efforts will contribute to a stronger foundation and continued excellence in serving our clients as two leading independent companies. Turning to slide 15 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted a very strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings. Operating cash flow was $219 million and free cash flow was $180 million. As a result, we were able to deliver above our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted cash flow conversion targets for the year with 104% underlying cash conversion. During fiscal year 2023, we returned 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders for a total of $480 million through both share repurchases and dividends. Though we were unable to repurchase shares in the quarter due to the CMS separation, we utilize cash flow to strategically pay down floating rate debt, ensuring a more robust financial position for the future. This disciplined approach aligns with our commitment to long-term financial stability and value creation for our shareholders. We ended the quarter with cash of $927 million and gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in just over $1.9 billion of net debt. Our Q4 net debt to 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4 times remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile, both today and as a more focused business, post our announced CMS separation. In August, we completed the offering of $600 million in senior unsecured notes due 2028 with a fixed rate of 6.35%. This allowed us to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of the end of Q4, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. We intend to opportunistically retire floating rate debt in the coming quarters. For your benefit, in the appendix of the presentation, we have included additional detail on our debt and quarterly interest expense. Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. On November 9, we paid a $0.26 dividend, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. Finally, I wanted to highlight our cost optimization plan shared on slide 16. We recognize that our cost structure is high. And we see opportunities to optimize in the coming quarters and post CMS separation. We have identified over $90 million in run rate savings, including lower corporate and allocated costs to the specific measures that we are starting to action. We expect to reduce our corporate unallocated costs from around $60 million per quarter to approximately $50 million per quarter, including full elimination of stranded costs post separation. We are streamlining our operating model with an eye towards positioning us for growth and cost efficiency, while staying focused on our clients. While we will not yet comment on long-term growth and margin expectations beyond our 2025 strategic plan, we believe we can deliver over 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from fiscal 2023 as reported margins to fiscal 2025 for standalone Jacobs. This results in an expected adjusted EBITDA margins for standalone Jacobs of at least 13.8% in fiscal year 2025. This is a bold undertaken as it is our longer-term aspiration to deliver best-in-class industry margins. In closing, Bob and I are committed to 3 things over the next few quarters. First, driving efficiencies in our business and maximizing our profitability as demonstrated by the margin targets. Second, position in our business with the financial resources needed for multiyear free cash flow growth. Third, strengthening discipline and deploying our shareholder capital. Thank you. And I will turn the call over to Bob. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Claudia. Turning to slide 16. As we discussed throughout our remarks, we remain committed to accelerating robust growth opportunities ahead for all businesses. Given today's global macro uncertainty, that strength is more relevant than ever as we plan for the future as two independent companies. It's crucial to emphasize that the underlying fundamentals of our business have never been stronger. Turning to fiscal year \u201824 outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.6 billion with an adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.20, representing a 9% and 10% and growth at the midpoint, respectively. This outlook incorporates the full-year contributions of the businesses to be separate. We expect a fiscal year \u201824 effective tax rate of 22%. As Claudia previously mentioned, we will carry temporarily elevated overhead costs needed to support CMS during the separation, including IT and corporate support. This, coupled with a historical seasonality, will have an approximately 10% negative effect year-over-year on adjusted EPS in Q1. We believe these costs are necessary to continue to support our clients as we progress through this transition period. This temporary cost is non-recurring and shall not be viewed as a reflection of a stand-alone company earnings power. We are well positioned to accelerate profitable growth in the years to come as we seek to compound per share value for our shareholders. We continue to be energized and excited about the future for Jacobs and CMS, and remain confident in our plan for long-term value creation. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry, your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning everyone and congratulations on all the strong work here. Can I just ask in terms of the margin expansion targets. Can we just flesh that out a little bit and just talk a little bit more about the timing, how back-end loaded is that '24 versus '25, and if we just unpack the pieces a little bit more in terms of just the buckets of the 300 basis points relative sizes, that would be helpful. Thank you. Claudia Jaramillo : Hi, Jerry, so I would like to -- you have some of the details on this slide. And so let me just go over the details of this slide. So you have first a component of the stranded cost. So that one will happen after the separation. So that's roughly $50 million that you see there. So then you have one that we started to taking action, which is really the operating model, and that will obviously accelerate after the separation, but we've already taken action on that. So you'll see some of that over time in \u201824 and accelerated after the separation. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you have the overhead or the unallocated corporate that we normally see -- you normally see it as a separate line. And I talked about the $60 million down to $50 million. We will carry some temporary costs to support CMS as we prepare it for the independent company or the combined company. And that one as well, you'll accelerate in 2025. So in summary, you'll see a little bit in '24 accelerating after the separation. If I want to give you the nature of what is that, is really the -- a lot of the support is IT, the support layers and just in general, a simpler management structure and support. Jerry Revich : Okay, super. And then the core underlying People & Places cadence that's better than that. Can you just expand on how that looks versus what you folks laid out to us in the 2025 plan? How -- what's progressing faster or slower than expectations relative to the segment margin ramp that you laid out just over a year ago? Bob Pragada : Yes. What we laid out over a year ago, Jerry, continues. With regards to the P&PS margin expectations in that strategic time period, that hasn't changed. Jerry Revich : Okay, thanks, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Chad, your line is open. Chad Dillard : Hi, good morning, guys. So I just wanted to continue on the margin question. I was hoping you could bridge the 300 basis points, how much comes from CMS? How much comes from, I guess, the decision to include Divergent Solutions the cost out? And is there anything else that we should be thinking about when bridging today versus 2025? Claudia Jaramillo : So Chad, the 13.8% is the stand-alone Jacobs, so it excludes CMS and Cyber & Intelligence. And then the nature of those costs is the three buckets that I mentioned before, which are really corporate unlocated going from the $60 million run rate to $50 million run rate post separation, and then the operating model, which is $50 million in total run rate and then full elimination of stranded costs up to the separation. Bob Pragada : Chad, if you were to take it in two buckets, Chad -- if you're taking two buckets, half is coming from the operating model of a cost structure that's more in line with the type of business that we will have and half is coming from margin expansion and margin mix. It's a higher margin, higher growth business. So think about it simplistically that way. Chad Dillard : Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a question for you on backlog growth. I appreciate that gross margin in backlog is growing by 8%. But I was hoping maybe you could frame backlog growth, excluding the capacity revenues. Just really trying to understand what were some of the puts versus the takes, strength versus weakness that you're seeing underlying in People & Places? And then maybe you can talk about just the size of the pipeline. Bob Pragada : Yes. I don't actually think, Chad, it's a weakness. Actually, I think it's really strong in our P&PS business right now. It's really on project life cycle. We measure that revenue growth based on where we are in the project life cycle, right? And so when we're deep into whether it be advanced facilities jobs or large infrastructure programs, we're going to be burning and booking and burning a lot higher revenue kind of models. But as our business continues to profile more into a consultancy world, we're executing higher value services over the project and program life cycle. So you'll have lower revenue, higher margin opportunities come into backlog, and it just depends on when that program life cycle is. So we've talked about it before, which one is accelerating at a faster rate. I'd kind of tie that to where are we in the cycle of some of the spends. Chad Dillard : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Micheal, your line is open. Michael Dudas : Hi, good morning, Claudia. Claudia Jaramillo : Good morning. Bob Pragada : Good morning, Mike. Michael Dudas : Bob, maybe you could share maybe a touch of the pipeline of backlog. As you're entering 2024 in P&PS, you touched on water in your prepared remarks. What are some of the other areas that you see some interesting opportunities for new project backlog growth? And how much of -- you mentioned about the change in mix of the type of service that you're going to be providing to your client base. How quickly or how noticeable will that be maybe on the project management consultancy side as we run through the revenue model over the next maybe two to three years? Bob Pragada : So two parts. One, Mike, you're asking about kind of what are some of the other end market secular trends that we're seeing? And then the second part of the question is around how do we see kind of revenue models as our consultancy business continues to grow -- consultancy type business. Is that fair? Michael Dudas : Yes, to drive that, the better mix that you're talking about over your\u2026 Bob Pragada : Sure, sure. The other verticals, I mentioned of our top 30 wins, nine are in water. If you take water and advanced facilities, it's -- half of the top 31s were in both of those sectors, six big advanced facilities markets, too. So we continue to see strong activity within the advanced facilities world, probably driven more so now as we bottomed out from an end market standpoint as far as sales goes within the semiconductor industry. Keep in mind, our clients continue to spend through there. But now with the GLP-1 drugs going on in life sciences and all the strength that we see with our clients we've had for years, advanced facilities is going to continue to be strong. And then the others, I'd highlight is energy transition. I highlighted a specific job, but the whole grid modernization of everything that we're seeing, and we're kind of in that consultancy component of that, and that's a strong piece, which is a segue to the second part. I would say that, that continued profile of our portfolio within now, call it, independent Jacobs, is we're kind of in the early innings of that. And so it's going to be a balance. But I'd say over the course of the next two or three, four years, it's going to drive that margin expansion even beyond what Claudia talked about post '25 with a cash conversion component to that that's very high. Michael Dudas : Perfect, I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy, your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone, again. Bob Pragada : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : So just sorting through Q4 results, I know there's a lot of noise because of the announced deal, but EPS and upcoming in below the low end of your previous guidance, could you give us more color into what exactly happened in the quarter that was below your expectations? And you mentioned the $40 million of temporary costs that you're carrying and how that's impacting your results. Should we simply be adding that $40 million back to your $1.53 billion to $1.6 billion EBITDA for '24 to get what guidance would have been if you weren't doing the RMT? Claudia Jaramillo : Yes. So Andy, so let's start with the first one, which is the big one and explains roughly half of the gap is the tax piece. And I had -- I included some of them in my remarks. So if I take, it's $0.06, so it's more the -- when you have a one-off allowance, and this is something that happens with your deferred tax. And -- so then the next one is going to be basically overhead costs or unallocated is one, we call it corporate unallocated. That's the other big piece. And then the share count, and I mentioned why we could do stock repurchases in the fourth quarter given -- based on the transaction. So that's at a high level what that means. Then I added some of the commentary that is on the temporary cost that we're carrying as we prepare CMS and the Cyber & Intelligence unit to operate independently. So that's the other piece of the puzzle, if you want. Andy Kaplowitz : Claudia, is it right to say that you could -- again, if you weren't doing the RMT, you would add that $40 million debt to EBITDA? Or is that not right to think like that? Claudia Jaramillo : Absolutely. And that's what Bob mentioned that towards the end, that's really our earnings power should exclude that -- those temporary costs. We're very client-centric. It's our clients' mission, and we want to make sure we have quite a bit of value tied to this transaction and the upside that we included in this additional value that we're going to get in the transaction and the new entity. We won the two entities to be very successful. It's temporary. And is to make sure we're preparing to have a very leader that we want and that we continue to be. Andy Kaplowitz : Great, and then Bob\u2026 Bob Pragada : So Andy just to clarify. So the EBITDA guidance that I gave at the end we're carrying it in that guidance. Andy Kaplowitz : Yes, that's clear. And then, Bob, just P&PS, net revenue up 11% year I think you said you have good confidence in mid- to high single-digit organic revenue growth. Could you elaborate on the confidence do you see P&PS backlog growing at that rate in FY '24? And then how are you thinking about the balance between higher interest rates impacting projects and geopolitical risks with all the fiscal stimulus, that you mentioned and so on. Bob Pragada : Yes. I think on the backlog piece of the question, Andy, my answer is yes, I think that mid- to high single-digit growth will continue. Remember, we've got a really nice diversity within P&PS. So if we think about some of the political risk or what's happening with interest rates, which might be affecting some of our private sector clients, there's not a full immunity, but our private sector clients continue to spend just because of the -- whether they be technology-based or global supply chain based, I say technology-based science-based drivers or supply chain drivers that has continued, and that's really been driving the performance. As far as IIJA or a larger infrastructure around energy transition outside the U.S., we have not seen that effect. In fact, our pipeline continues to grow at mid to high-single-digit percentages, and this is on a base that's very high. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open. Bert Subin : Hey, good morning Bob and Claudia. Thank you for the time. Bob Pragada : Hey, Bert. Claudia Jaramillo : Hi. Bert Subin : Bob maybe just taking that, I think that was more of a backlog question. You said in your prepared remarks, the outlook remains very healthy. Can you just walk us through how you're thinking about the organic growth profile for the company in this coming year? Just for Remainco, you think the previous range for FY '24 for P&PS was a 6% to 9% organic CAGR, with PA Consulting at 12% to 15%, do those remain intact? And on the advanced facility side, pretty positive comments there. Do you think that can keep growing double digits? Bob Pragada : Yes. So the first part of the question, Bert, my answer is yes. I think on advanced facilities, I would say the underlying growth is strong. A lot of these larger programs, whether they be in the semiconductor space or in the life sciences space, are -- there are several, in fact, from an account standpoint, it's probably the highest that it's been. It continues to stay at a very high level. We're seeing now kind of the next wave of -- I mentioned GLP-1, but also other novel therapies run, oncology and some of the neuroscience projects that we're seeing. So the numbers will stay -- as far as numbers of opportunities will stay high. Where they are in the project life cycle will kind of balance -- imagine there's two curves. One is kind of coming down as far as the way that we saw. The others coming up, which kind of leads to a 12 to 13 -- I'm sorry, 12 to 18 month kind of reset there. Gather everything that I just said, your numbers work. Bert Subin : Got it. Okay. And maybe just a level deeper into the P&PS side. You mentioned some positive remarks on water and on international opportunities. Can you just sort of give us the viewpoint on how you're thinking about, I guess, the regional disparity in FY '24? As FX starts to become less of a factor, do you think what you're seeing in Europe and other parts of the world can rival sort of the growth we're expecting from IIJA in the U.S.? Bob Pragada : I don't know if it will get to that level. But I think it will be robust. And I think Claudia mentioned it, our European business, despite these macro headwinds that it faced has done well. And so I think water transportation, energy transition that's driving the U.S., probably more pronounced around energy transition in Europe. Middle East is across all of our sectors -- P&PS sectors in the Middle East. And then in Southeast Asia and Australia and New Zealand, those have remained strong. Our business in APAC this year grew at significant double digits. And so a smaller base in the rest of the world. So I'd say all in all, the geographic diversity that we have in our business really, really is strong and helps us. Bert Subin : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven, your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the mix element of the 300 basis point margin bridge. I think, Bob, when you were talking about the half before that's mix, like how much of that is related to just not having the lower margin in CMS in there versus achieving better margins in P&PS? I guess I'm wondering when all is said and done with your cost optimization, will your segment-level margins be better? Or will that come out of some other initiatives over time? Claudia Jaramillo : Yes. So Steven, let me just make sure I understand. So I'll recap what Bob said, and then I'll address the segment margins. So the first one is the going up to 13.8%, roughly half is just the mix. And by mix, I mean, just what remains with us. The other half is the cost optimization, the streamlining of the operating model. And that is really a function of the remaining businesses removing costs and also the addition of our digital enablement and all that. So that and other works, the segments remain with us or the businesses that stay with us are going to increase their individual margins. Does that answer your question? Steven Fisher : Yes, it does. So as part of the cost optimization, there is segment level efficiency initiatives as opposed to just sort of the corporate level element. Yes, that's helpful. Claudia Jaramillo : Both operations that's what the operating model, that's where it shows overall as a company. Yes. Steven Fisher : Okay. Great. And just trying to think about your debt position in about 12 months from now. I'm not sure if I missed if you frame this out or not, but $1.9 billion of net debt now, $1 billion of dividend coming back from the separation to pay down debt. Free cash flow looks like it would be about another $1 billion before whatever cash restructuring expenses you're calling out. I don't know how much that is. But are you assuming close to sort of a net cash position exiting 2024? Claudia Jaramillo : Yes. So all our decisions are guided by a few principles. The first one is maintaining an investment-grade rating. Very important for us to maintain the strategic flexibility that we want. So those decisions are guided by our conversations with the rating agencies, especially with this transaction. And the other one is our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. So as we go to the transaction, I think one of the elements is also the element of distribution to our shareholders, and that's one of the reasons I highlighted so much we returned this quarter -- this year, and that is an important guiding principle for us is on a risk-adjusted basis to make the best decisions for our shareholders. And so I think that's an important element in the equation. Steven Fisher : Thank you very much. Claudia Jaramillo : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Hey, good morning, guys. Bob Pragada : Hey, Gautam. Good morning. Claudia Jaramillo : Hi, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could characterize the risk profile, some of the projects you've been booking in the backlog given the margins seem to be higher. Are these mostly fixed cost, what allows the profits to be higher? Just the mix of fixed price? Is there any more -- just how would you characterize. Thank you. Bob Pragada : Yes. No, Gautam, it's a great question because it's where we're playing within the client business. I mean we're talking about a level of scientific and technical offering that is at the highest part of the business of our clients' business. And so whether it be in our pure-play PA Consulting work or in our science-based technical offering in the infrastructure and advanced facility space, that garners a higher level commercial model, part one. Part two is around the digital enablement, right? We're actually offering outcome-based solutions rather than the historical, I'm going to get margin from a commercial model that's either fixed or reimbursable and trade on a productivity gain. We're able to get those types of margins with -- we'll get them in a reimbursable scenario or we'll get them in a fixed-price services scenario just because of the level of impact that we're having in our clients' business. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just one quick follow-up. You guys have talked about your PFAS technology. I was just curious if you've had any commercial traction yet? And if not, when do you anticipate booking some of that PFAS-related work? Bob Pragada : Yes, it has. It has in the PFAS work, to segregate it out as an end market, we haven't. Where we're seeing the PFAS gain is in our water center. These wins that I'm referencing as well as some of the larger framework agreements that we have for water clients, whether they be federal, state or local around the world, that comes into play. We're actually making PFAS type of consultancy arrangements around that, too. The real PFAS for PFAS sake across the industry comes when you get type of super fund type of application in these containments being highlighted on public dockets. So we're -- we see growth, but I would look at that growth probably from a perspective of how it affects our end market sectors. And then when you get kind of in the 25%, 26%, 27% range and you start to get some compliance related items that are even further driving those end market sectors it gets bigger. Gautam Khanna : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sabahat Khan : Great, thanks and good morning. I guess I just want to get a little bit of perspective on maybe just the medium term even if it's directionally. As you look at the 13.8% in fiscal \u201825, and maybe just think about your mix by end market and region. If we just think moving on from that, is there opportunity whether to maybe look within P&PS for maybe lower margin businesses? Or where you expand geographically? I'm just thinking about the levers kind of going forward you see for the P&PS margins beyond just cost optimization to sort of get to that level in a few years? Bob Pragada : Okay, you go ahead. Claudia Jaramillo : Yes. So I'd say this is something that we do -- we're doing currently, and we do all the time. So I would say two big levers are the -- our global delivery platform is one, very important, and we have one of the best platforms, if not the best, and it's been for several years. That's the first one. The other one is the digital enablement. And you see at some of the projects that we highlighted today are you see a clear differentiation that we have compared to our competitors, where we -- the digital enablement and the outcome based that Bob mentioned before, drives those more profitable projects. Bob Pragada : Yes. And just to add one more thing, Sabahat, on the kind of the -- what we need. We don't -- we feel really strongly that our portfolio in the end markets that we're in is strong. Claudia talked about our two biggest enablers. I'll add a third, which is our consultancy enablement as well. But it's not like we need to go search for new geographies or buy skill sets in an end market sector. It's really the expansion through the digital and consultancy-based enablement, coupled with access to global talent, which -- I'll be in high agreements that we're one of the best in how we deliver on that. Sabahat Khan : Okay. Great. And then as you think about your guidance for kind of next year, kind of the numbers embedded in your three-year plan, you laid out the 6% to 9% for P&PS. And even as you look out sort of maybe another year beyond that, what mix of price versus volume do you anticipate given some of the funding that's in the system right now? And how should we think about that mix over the next couple of years, particularly in the kind of infra space? Bob Pragada : Yes. I think that that's going to be tied to this enablement component. It's not -- this is honed in because it's kind of a different -- probably a different answer for different components of that infrastructure in advanced facility space, but this is honed in on infrastructure. Our clients are capped with how much they can spend for the infrastructure needs. So what we do is we come in with an offering where we're gaining margin with the enablement of outcomes-based solutions. So there's a price component that -- but with a higher margin what we're driving with our digital enablement. So we see that driving to the bottom line as we do all the things that Claudia talked about is creating a more simplified and streamlined organization. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy your line is open. Andy Wittmann : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess it would just be kind of helpful to understand the timing on the $275 million of costs associated with all these actions. It sounds like there's going to be some here ahead of the transaction, but some probably translate to after the transaction. Claudia, can you just talk about the timing of those cash items and recognition of those on the income statement? Claudia Jaramillo : So Andy, this is very closely linked to the execution of the separation. So there will be more towards the end, you will have more because of elimination of -- we talked about the stranded costs and the advisers and all that, but very much throughout if you're going to see it because of the advisory fees and all that I mentioned before. So that's just aligned with the time line of the separation. Andy Wittmann : Okay. And then I guess -- I don't to do next. I guess I guess on the 1Q guide, I guess I just want to get a little bit more comfortable with that. I don't think you're saying that the corporate unallocated cost run rate is going to be higher in 1Q. It sounds like you're saying it's going to be about the same. I just wanted to confirm that. Then when you talk about the seasonality, I guess, there's always seasonality in 1Q. What's different about this year's seasonality? Is it just the fact that the items that were called out in last year's footnote that present a tough comp that weren't excluded? And I guess maybe related to that, if there are costs that are related to restructuring and separation, why aren't those being excluded in the first quarter? Claudia Jaramillo : No, I think we talked about -- well, there is a seasonality of the business. So yes, I'd say yes to that one. And then the ones that I mentioned of the $40 million, just at a high level, the cost that we're carrying to support the separation of CMS. So it's really linked to the transaction or the preparing CMS to operate in the new environment. So those, I would say -- that one amplifies the impact. But I didn't say it would be higher on the $60 million is more what we carry in extra throughout or across the company to support CMS. CMS and Cyber & Intelligence. Andy Wittmann : Alright, thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no more questions. And now I would like to turn the call back over to the team. Bob Pragada : Yes. Thank you, everyone. We're excited about the future, and we look forward to providing more updates as we progress our exciting plan forward. Thank you, everyone. Claudia Jaramillo : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Evans, VP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jonathan Evans : Thank you, Audra. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics.  We have also introduced a new supplement that consolidates certain information, including our non-GAAP financial tables. Additionally, beginning with this quarter, the company will no longer apply an adjustment to adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EPS, which previously resulted in the application of the expected annual tax rate to all quarterly periods. Prior comparable periods are also being presented on this basis.  Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Claudia Jaramillo. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and summarizing highlights from our first quarter results. Claudia will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow.  With that, I'll turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Jonathan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure and accelerating profitable growth and margin expansion across our lines of business. Our team continues to demonstrate great resilience and dedication as we delivered better-than-expected underlying results in Q1, while also working to the added task of standing up 2 independent companies. At the corporate level, we are diligently working to create a leaner operating model that aligns Jacobs' position as a global leader in delivering science-based digitally-enabled solutions to our clients. And allowing us to benefit fully from the broad-based strength that we see in global infrastructure and sustainability investments. We are confident that our actions we are taking are providing the foundation for multiyear improvement in profitability and margins, and we look forward to sharing more detail in the quarters to come.  Turning to Slide 4. I want to provide a brief update on a few key milestones related to the spin-off and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions in Cyber and Intelligence businesses with momentum. We continue to progress towards closing of the transaction in the second half of fiscal year 2024, consistent with our previous expectations. Together with momentum, we are making progress on preparing our Form 10 and private letter ruling request in keeping with the established time line of the transaction. Additionally, we are progressing antitrust filings and regulatory approvals. Upon the public filing of the Form 10, we aim to offer more comprehensive information and look forward to introducing the combined leadership team to our investors and analysts later this spring.  I would also likely -- like to briefly touch on the cost optimization plan that we outlined last quarter. Our transformation to a less vulnerable and higher-value, higher-margin portfolio is well underway. We continue to find new ways to streamline our operating model. And while it is too early to positively revise our targets, we are increasingly confident in our ability to enhance our long-term profitability. As we progress towards separation and optimizing our corporate cost structure, we now are able to better align costs to the applicable business units.  As a result, we have made the decision to shift some corporate unallocated costs into the current P&PS segment, which will allow for greater long-term recovery of our corporate overhead. While this has the effect of temporarily weighing on our segment operating margins, this has no impact on our bottom line today. Rather, this will boost corporate profitability in the long run as we gradually recover cost from public sector clients. Providing upside beyond the initial 13.8% adjusted EBITDA margin target set for stand-alone Jacobs, post separation that we shared last quarter. This adds to our conviction that our transformation will drive multiyear value creation.  Turning to Slide 5. In Q1, I'm pleased to report a strong first quarter revenue driven by 9.5% gross and 7.9% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 5% year-over-year, and gross margin in backlog improved 29 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our businesses can continue their profitable growth trends. This quarter's results include a onetime noncash $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding this item, adjusted operating profit would have increased versus the prior year period. We saw a continuation of strong organic growth in P&PS with 8.4% adjusted net revenue growth. We had a Q1 operating cash flow of $418 million, up 38% year-over-year. Strong cash conversion is a hallmark of our asset-light business model and remain robust in Q1 with $401 million in free cash flow, and we expect to generate greater than 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024. The ultimate measure of our ability to create value is long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and that will continue to be our North Star.  Turning to Slide 6. Our People & Places line of business generated strong top line growth with adjusted net revenue up 8.4% year-over-year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 6% organic growth. We continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth as demonstrated by gross profit and backlog increasing 7% year-over-year.  Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS organic growth of mid- to high-single digits in FY '24. We anticipate full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.  The water market remains to be a pacesetter within the company. In particular, water scarcity continues to trend across the globe, affecting billions of people. Decades of increasing population growth and agricultural demand have significantly depleted the quantity and quality of water resources. Jacobs is a leader in developing solutions to address water scarcity, including water reuse, groundwater management and desalinization. In the Americas, California and Colorado have recently adopted regulations for direct potable reuse. And Arizona is making positive strides towards adopting similar regulations. Notably, the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, is currently building a new semiconductor facility in Arizona. We've been selected for the first phase of the design and project delivery of the campus' industrial reclaimed water plant. In addition, multiple states in the U.S. are developing regional water supply plants to balance water availability and economic growth. As an example of such work, we were awarded a $191 million project in St. Johns County, Florida for the design and project delivery of a water reclamation facility.  This facility will treat 3.25 million gallons of water daily for beneficial reuse with 13 miles of transitioning pipelines to deliver reclaimed water for residential irrigation.  In transportation, we have a long-term relationship with Brightline West and have been awarded the design of the 218-mile high-speed rail linking Las Vegas to Southern California. Brightline West through a partnership with Nevada successfully secured $3 billion in grants from the Federal Railroad Administration as part of the IIJA funding.  In Life Sciences, we're supporting Lilly, with permitting and conceptual design for their injectable manufacturing facility in Alzey, Germany, to support an increased demand for their medicines, including their diabetes and obesity portfolio.  We continue to secure additional large engagements in the Middle East. For example, we've been appointed to provide preliminary and detail design and supervision services for utility and road infrastructure, including major road upgrades for Wadi Safar and Diriyah Gate 2 in Saudi Arabia.  In CMS, we performed very well in Q1, continuing the profitability trend demonstrated in FY '23. CMS' Q1 revenue was up 5% over year and operating profit increased 14% behind 63 basis points of margin expansion. Its pipeline and growth outlook remains strong with major award prospects in FY '24 and a light recompete schedule. The CMS team is executing well and has great momentum as they prepare to be an independent company.  PA Consulting continues to take share as demonstrated by an 8.5% revenue growth in what continues to be a choppy macro environment, particularly in the U.K. Margins were light due to some softness in December. However, we continue to expect approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year and have confidence in our ability to manage variable costs to achieve that goal.  Together with PA, we celebrated new wins with the office of gas and electricity markets in the U.K. for program management services and regulatory practices that will advance the safe and secure supply of hydrogen.  Our Divergent Solutions operating unit delivered a solid quarter with 5% adjusted net revenue growth. Profits were impacted by an approximately $15 million onetime in connection with the merger. Underlying performance in the business was strong and excluded this write-down. Adjusted operating margins would have been approximately 700 basis points higher and exceeded our expectations for the quarter.  In summary, we remain well positioned to grow while serving our clients with excellence and delivering science-based digitally-enabled solutions for a more connected and sustainable world. And we continue generating strong free cash flow conversion, which will enable us to return capital to shareholders as we chart our new path forward as 2 independent companies.  Now I'll turn the call over to Claudia to review our financial results in further detail. Claudia Jaramillo : Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q1 results, which came in above our expectations. Our results illustrate our ability to deliver on our long-standing financial objectives, while at the same time, generating strong free cash flow and returning a significant portion of our cash to shareholders.  So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7. First quarter gross revenue grew 9.5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 7%. GAAP operating profit was $204 million for the quarter and included $51 million of amortization for acquired intangibles and $60 million of other transaction, separation related restructuring and other costs. This includes $51 million associated with the separation of CMS. Our adjusted operating margin was 9.8%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reported segment review.  GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.37 per share. And included a $0.27 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.37 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.02, up 28% year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS included a $0.49 benefit related to a discrete tax item and a $0.09 headwind related to the noncash inventory write-down.  Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $328 million and was down 3.1% year-over-year, representing 10% of our adjusted net working capital. Excluding the inventory write-down, adjusted EBITDA would be roughly flat year-over-year. The effective tax rate of 4.2% benefited from $61.6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the permanent reinvestment of capital gains associated with an overseas subsidiary. This tax benefit was incorporated in our annual guidance and we continue to forecast the 22% annual effective tax rate to fiscal year 2024.  We will no longer be adjusting our non-GAAP EPS to align with our full year effective tax rate expectations. With the entirety of the deferred tax benefit in Q1, we now expect quarterly effective tax rate to approximate 26% to 27% for each quarter of the remainder of the fiscal year.  Finally, backlog was up 5% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was just over 1.12x, with our gross profit in backlog increasing 6.1% year-over-year. Regarding the performance of our [indiscernible] in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8.  Starting with People & Places Solutions. Q1 adjusted net revenue was up 8.4% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit was down slightly, resulting in adjusted operating margins of 13.7%. However, excluding the impact of cost allocation changes previously mentioned, adjusted operating profit would have resulted in approximately 7% year-over-year growth. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business and anticipate full year P&PS adjusted operating margins to increase year-over-year, inclusive of the previously mentioned increase in allocation of overhead costs.  Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q1 revenue increased 5% year-over-year with backlog up 9%, continuing a consistent trend of high-single-digit growth over multiple quarters. We also continue to find avenues through operational improvement with CMS operating margins rising by 63 basis points year-over-year. Shifting to Divergent Solutions. In Q1, our adjusted net revenue increased by 4.7% year-over-year. Underlying execution was strong. Adjusted operating profit was $8 million, including the $15 million inventory write-down. Excluding the one-off write-down, performance was above expectations. Now let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q1 saw an 8.5% year-over-year revenue increase. PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline. However, the U.K.'s ongoing election cycle introduces macro risks that we are closely monitoring. We remain confident in our ability to navigate these factors by managing variable costs and are targeting approximately 20% adjusted operating margins for the full year. In total, it was a strong quarter for each of our segments from an execution standpoint.  Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q1. This quarter's cost excluded previously mentioned costs that are now being allocated to the P&PS segment. As we continue to enhance operational efficiencies and optimize our operating model, we expect this line item to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually post debt pressure.  Turning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We posted another quarter of strong cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. As Bob mentioned, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $401 million. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver our anticipated 100% reported and adjusted free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings.  Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent returns to our shareholders. We still have $775 million remaining under last year's repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders in aligning with our overarching goal of compounding free cash flow per share.  We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.14 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion. Our Q1 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.2x is a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. As of the end of Q1, approximately 35% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.1%. Finally, with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized an 11.5% increase to $0.29 per quarter, and our quarterly dividend will be paid on March 22. With this, we have increased our dividends each year since 2018, driving a nearly 12% dividend CAGR over that period.  Now I will turn it back to Bob. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Claudia. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to be energized as interest in our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains robust as clients engage Jacobs to solve their most complex challenges. Internally, we remain focused on execution and continuing to deliver against our operational and financial objectives. We reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.60 billion, with adjusted EPS of $7.70 to $8.20, representing 9% and 10% growth at midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.02 and as Claudia shared, a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of this fiscal year. Though we expect a heavier than normal cost structure until separation, particularly in [indiscernible], we anticipate accelerating EPS growth in the second half of the fiscal year.  In closing, we've maintained focus on standing up both independent Jacobs and CMS for success while streamlining and optimizing our operating model and positioning both companies for long-term value creation.  Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Andy Wittmann at Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Oh, great. I guess for those who are unfamiliar, including myself to some extent here, on the SG&A reallocation into the segment, I think what you're saying there is if -- in these reimbursable public sector customers that you have, if you can show -- if it's in the segment, you can get paid basically for those costs. I think that's the mechanism. I just wanted to clarify that. And maybe, Claudia, could you talk about what the dollar amount on an annual basis is on the reallocation from the SG&A line into the segment? . Robert Pragada : Yes, Andy, it's a great question. It's actually a nice lead-in. So your assessment of that recoverability is correct. And if you just kind of just moment -- for a moment, kind of pre planning for the separation and outpost. Pre, we had a lot of shared costs. And so the direct applicability through the segment was not as clear. And since we started this, we had a great opportunity to now have direct line of sight to where these are being applied. Hit it right in the beginning of the audit cycle, the government audit cycle in Q1 and now have the full year of applying those costs.  So that's -- that's correct. Now on the full year amount, it would be the $17 million that we identified this year -- I'm sorry, this quarter multiplied by 4. But remember, over each quarter that goes down because of the recoverability effect. Did that make sense? Andrew Wittmann : Yes, I guess it does. The -- I mean the -- so I guess, with -- in the corporate unallocated reported at $59 million for the quarter, I guess what you're saying is unadjusted, that number would have been $17 million higher. In other words, that $59 million benefits from the $17 million that was moved? Robert Pragada : That's correct. Andrew Wittmann : Can you just talk about -- underlying that business -- or underlying the underlying costs for the corporate unallocated. Were there any other costs that are notable in terms of separation or other things through the SG&A line right now? Certainly, there's been these efficiency initiatives, Bob, that you've talked a lot about. But is there anything else we should know about that wasn't excluded from that corporate unallocated line? Robert Pragada : No. No, the $9 million of transition costs took it to $59 million and then the $17 million that we were able to, from a positive standpoint, move into P&PS and get recoverability on it was it. I will say, Andy, we are making progress on kind of our overall cost optimization or reductions that we started at the beginning of the year, to where we'll be right on plan of what we identified last quarter. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Dudas at Vertical Research Partners. Michael Dudas : Maybe you can share a little bit more on PP&S relative to the pipeline as it stands today. You talked a little bit in your prepared remarks about margin improvement in backlog. How does that track as we go through fiscal year 2024? Is the -- are you getting better share on higher-margin projects, maybe early consulting advisory relative to design work in some of these projects? And what areas do you anticipate some of the better revenue and booking growth in the P&PS segment as we move through '24? Robert Pragada : Yes. Mike, it's a great question. So the short answer is yes. We are starting to see that margin increase according to the profile and the mix. And I'd probably index more towards the water market right now on the mix. Just to give you a statistic, year-on-year growth in our bookings in water have gone up 30%. The other kind of notable one is what we call cities and places, but it's kind of our built environment business, it's been really driven by the Middle East. That year-on-year has been about 40%. And what's kind of positive about both of those -- and I never thought that I'd say this before, but from a cash standpoint and a margin standpoint, we're hitting company-wide type of margin targets in the Middle East, which is a positive. And then the water sector has traditionally been our higher-margin component of our business. So kind of 2 trends there. Michael Dudas : Perfect. And what about for bookings and outlook as we move through 2024? Are those the areas you concentrated or are there other areas, given life science, [indiscernible] et cetera? Robert Pragada : Yes. So moving forward, we're starting to see some pretty exciting developments happening within the life sciences world. That -- as we've talked about it before, it's been red hot for several years. I'd say, the last couple of quarters, we've seen -- it hasn't declined, but it hasn't been accelerating the way it was in the past. Just in the last 6 weeks, we've had some really deep conversations but these are Tier 1 clients we've had forever, that hopefully we'll be reporting some really good news next quarter on those jobs.  I did mention the Lilly job in Germany. That portfolio, specifically around GLP-1 has continued to be strong. Novo just announced the acquisition of Catalent. Those Catalent facilities are going to need to be retrofitted and we were already in the middle of Novo's work. So that's a real positive too.  So I'd look at life sciences getting back. And then the chip manufacturing world has been kind of at the -- as our design work continued from an external semi market standpoint, we're now on the upswing of a new cycle. And so we're seeing more work around the tool OEM. So a lot of the R&D work in order to support these manufacturing facilities on higher-powered chips really driven by AI has been a nice early bookings. So kind of concept work that's happening there. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : So Bob, just following up on Mike's question. You mentioned water overall, the Middle East driving your overall People & Places business, which is great. But are there any areas that you are worried about on that side. You mentioned the U.K. for PA, but not really for People & Places. And your backlog was up nicely in the quarter. Does it just continue to sequentially rise from here? Robert Pragada : Yes, I'd say the answer to the last part, Andy, is yes. And from a margin -- from a P&L margin perspective, we feel comfortable that our year-on-year increase that I mentioned in the script, is real. And so year-on-year margin increased year-on-year. If there were areas where I'd say soft might be too strong, but if there are areas that we've got a high level of attention on, it is the U.K. We've been able to stay flat in the U.K., which is a positive. But we did have the national infrastructure and construction report just published here, I think it was Friday. And the U.K. government committing to the same level of spend, GBP 775 billion over the course of the next 10 years, with some consideration for inflation. So that's an area that we're continuing to put some attention on to make sure that we continue to grow, but overall positive. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And then maybe just on divergent solutions. I know a piece of it is going to go with the RMT, but maybe a little more color on the inventory write-down. Divergence just as you know, like underlying margin is good, but it's kind of been all over the place a little bit over the last several quarters. So what does Divergent look like as you go forward, let's say, post RMT for Jacobs? Robert Pragada : Yes. So let me just clarify one thing, Andy. The inventory write-down has to do with the Cyber & Intelligence business, and that actually is in the perimeter and will be going. And it's really a part of the separation financials and inventory that we had to disposition. So that's not in the piece that will continue with independent Jacobs. . We see more of it and we're working on this operating model right now. Transportation, water and what we're doing in the built environment around digital enablement, being a strong horizontal cross cutter through now the entirety of the business. So simplifying our reporting as well as taking all the successes that we had within the transportation and water digitization and digital enablement. And integrating them into now what will be independent Jacobs. And so much more to follow on that. Operator : Next, we'll move to Steven Fisher at UBS. . Steven Fisher : Bob, you mentioned that you're on track with the cost expectations you identified at the beginning of the year. So does that mean the $40 million of temporary costs and $275 million of restructuring are still the numbers to keep in mind. And if so, how much of that has been incurred to date? Is that the $17 million plus the $9 million? Or should the $40 million be lower now that you're going to be getting reimbursed for some of that. Robert Pragada : Yes. Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. That's a good clarification. So the first part of your question is yes, those $275 million and the $40 million are still very much in play. I'd say on the $40 million, that's not the -- the $9 million was what was incurred in the first quarter. And so the balance would be over the course of the next 3 quarters, and we're indexing probably more in the first half than the second half. So hopefully, that clarifies that. But yes, we're still on track within the numbers that we highlighted in the previous quarter. The $17 million is not included in that. The $17 million is our costs that are with us. They're recoverable. That's why we moved them into the segment. Claudia Jaramillo : And Steve, I'll add to the $275 million, we're also on track. And for that, it's a $51 million that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Steven Fisher : Okay. That's helpful. And then the 14.6% margin for P&PS, is that on the same basis as the 13.7% in Q1? I assume it is. And if so, and then how quickly do we get above that 14.6% to kind of deliver it for the full year given the lighter side in Q1? Robert Pragada : Yes. Steve, the answer to the first question is yes. And I'd say within the next few quarters. Steven Fisher : Okay. So in other words, Q2, we should still be expecting it to be below that? Or... Robert Pragada : No, no, no, no. It will sequentially increase over the next few quarters to where Q4 will be above where we were last year. Steven Fisher : Okay. I'm just. Robert Pragada : For the year. Yes. Steven Fisher : For this year? Robert Pragada : For this year. This year will be higher than the last year, year-on-year total. Steven Fisher : Right. This year, you're guiding to 14.6%, right? Do I have that right? Robert Pragada : Better than 14.6%. So last year was 14.6%. And then this year will be better than 14.6% full year. Steven Fisher : And if you're 14.7% for the quarter, you got to start being better than 14.6%. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out how quickly we get better than 14.6%. Is that... Claudia Jaramillo : It will be a gradual increase. Robert Pragada : And we'll see that within our reported financials. That's why that -- Steve, that's why I said a few quarters. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : This is Adam on for Jerry today. Can you talk about -- can you talk a bit more about what drove the 280 plus margin decline in PA Consulting even with revenues higher sequentially? And then what drives visibility on the margin ramp through the balance of the year? Robert Pragada : Sure. So what drives -- I'm going to answer the second part first, Adam. The pipeline as well as the -- we call it stock of work in PA, but its backlog, is driving the optimism there as well as the team really does have better arms around the variable cost structure of the entity. Similar to Jacobs, it's a people business, asset-light and services-oriented. The drop was probably driven a little bit by some volatility with our clients in December. And the discretionary spend of -- and it was kind of more in the U.K. business and around what was going on within U.K. government, defense and security as well as the public sector work. And so that was -- that kind of -- if it stops on a dime, we can't make those variable cost actions. And so we ended up seeing that in the quarter. That has since kind of returned and then we're managing our variable costs ahead of it, similar to what we did in mid last year. Unidentified Analyst : And then on the top line, solid growth this quarter, high-single digits, but the comps get a little harder from here. How are you thinking about the organic growth outlook in the balance of the year amid some of the things going on in the U.K. market? Robert Pragada : Yes. I think we're still in that kind of mid-single digits to mid-high singles. [indiscernible] for 3 years. 3 years has been double-digit growth. And so we're still growing. I think we're probably kind of in that mid-single-digit growth now. Operator : And next, we'll move to Chad Dillard at Bernstein. Charles Dillard : So I wanted to spend a little more time on just like what you're seeing from a booking standpoint, in People & Places. So first place is just like on the semiconductor side. So it sounds like there's a number of grants to be announced by the U.S. in March. To what extent do you think that could potentially unlock with more activity from a design standpoint. And then just like what are you seeing from like a domestic versus international perspective, just for semi design? Robert Pragada : Yes. So let me answer the first one, Chad, just writing some notes on. On the grants that are coming out, I would probably -- similar to what I said to Mike Dudas is that those grants are being utilized predominantly in the R&D side, right? Because these larger facilities need to get to full production and so the larger IDM or the integrated device manufacturers are probably thinking more about the semiconductor buy cycle, right, and timing their output or the start-up of those large plants. So those grants then go to where technology advancements are happening, and that's happening at the tool OEMs. And so actually those -- that's kind of driving our bookings right now as well, those tool OEMs. The great thing here about Jacobs is we're inside the technology of the tool and understand the facility requirements for them. So we got a nice position there, and that's what's kind of driving the bookings within the semi piece.  Right now, I'd say that predominantly, it's domestic. We are seeing some activity in Europe around the EU Chips Act. But really, the business is probably more indexed towards the domestic piece. I would say that the country that we're really watching and are in the midst and was just there in December is the growth of foreign direct investment in India.  And as chip manufacturing potentially pivots from China in India, so into India. And so we're kind of on the front end of that as well, both large-scale Indian clients as well as foreign companies that are non-Indian clients coming into India. Charles Dillard : Got it. That's super helpful. And then just going back to the cost reallocation from [indiscernible] allocated to People & Places. Just wanted to get a sense for like how long it will take before you actually can hit the P&L. Do you have to go through like a full bid cycle. So in other words, do you have to like fully turn over the backlog before you see those benefits? Robert Pragada : No, it's gradual. It's gradual. So those [indiscernible] starts the next quarter, I'd say from a full kind of actualization of those costs that goes in, it's about a 12 to 24-month cycle. But just to reiterate, Chad, we're reiterating our year-on-year margin improvement even with the gradual recoverability of that overhead. Operator : We'll go next to Sabahat Khan at RBC. Sabahat Khan : Just a follow-up on the PA conversation earlier. Obviously, we see the bookings number. But I guess, as you're talking to your clients in that space, are you seeing a bit of a pipeline build up there. That business is obviously a bit more macro impacted than the P&PS business but just wondering where sort of the conversations are that aren't in the backlog right now for that business line? Robert Pragada : Sure. I'd say that, so the 2 areas within PA that we're getting 1 actually is kind of ubiquitous in today's world as well as within the PA world. And then I'll go to an end market sector, is the use of AI and AI enablement in our clients' business as a driver of business transformation. And so to kind of toggle here, it's good for PA, it's good for Jacobs, in that the AI enablement is the start of the conversation. I think some clients now this kind of goes to how quickly does that get into an engagement, get into backlog, we realize in P&L. That's kind of where we are right now as far as where we are in the cycle. So AI is a big driver. But the timing and speed of how our clients are embracing it is driving some of the booking cycle.  The second from an end market standpoint is Life Sciences. And so PA has been able to take not just AI, but other knowledge and look at the transformation of the whole clinical study program, especially as that's kind of gotten more patient-centric with different types of therapies for each patient. PA has rightly been right in the middle of all of that. And so that kind of got a tail on it as well. And then the last one that is really kind of starting to develop in our pipeline at PA is around the use of AI in early-stage drug discovery piece, and it's real, real early stage. I mean clearly, the Tier 1s are way out ahead. But PA does it from more of a standpoint of how that's going to transform kind of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 clients. So some good stuff. I'd say this the timing right now of how quickly those get embraced while clients are thinking about their own business is causing some of that near-term softness. Sabahat Khan : Great. And then I guess on the P&PS side, there's been some discussion about when some of the larger funding packages really got going. But -- maybe if you could provide a little bit of color around your top line guidance for P&PS. And what assumption is in there from kind of contribution from the IIJA or the IRA. And -- or how much of it is from kind of just base level business and how maybe the government funding is tracking relative to initial expectations? Robert Pragada : Sure. Yes, I'd say that, that guidance that we've been pretty true to and I kind of -- I mentioned a statistic there that 6% to 9% or mid- to high-single-digit growth and for the last 5 quarters, we've been right there on the high end of that range is where we're seeing the IIJA component of that is we just saw some statistics that we're -- from a time line standpoint, halfway through, but on some of the larger rail and highway specifically, we're 25% outlaid -- 15% obligated and 25% outlaid on the actual money. So it hasn't been a big piece of the growth. But the positive news is that it looks like that 5-year cycle is definitely going to get extended. Operator : Our next question comes from Bert Subin at Stifel. Bert Subin : Bob, just to follow up on that point. If we look beyond '24 and maybe into '25 and past that, it sounds like your visibility is generally improving not just in advanced facilities but in large parts of P&PS. As you think about potentially toggling you're above what your medium-term view is for the segment, what would drive that? Is that more a function of winning some specific larger projects? Or is it the flow of funding under some of these programs? Robert Pragada : Yes, Bert. And are you saying independent of advanced facilities to the other kind of non-advanced facility sectors or to inclusive of. Bert Subin : No. I think inclusive of, I guess, from what you were saying, Bob, in your earlier comments, it sounds like you feel like you're more on that upslope and you're seeing sort of the path of some of that CapEx will be beneficial for you. So including that and thinking about what you just mentioned about IIJA and some of the other programs, it seems like your visibility is quite good. If you were to say, several years from now, look at you and you were growing at 9% or faster than your 6% to 9% growth range. I'm just curious if that's more a function of winning some of those larger projects that are out there? Or is it just the funding needs to flow sort of on time? Robert Pragada : I would say it's probably more of winning those projects in the market that I would index towards is water. The pipeline growth in water, and I mentioned it last quarter, Bert, and it actually has continued this quarter. It's not as big as transportation, but if transportation continues at the same kind of clip even with the IIJA comment, but water continues at the rate that it is right now, and we're having this conversation 6 to 8 quarters from now, water and then water and environmental for those 2 are kind of interdependent on each other. I'd say, is the one where we're seeing not only the projects being announced but the funding be applied, and a lot of that is being driven around water scarcity.  And look at what's going on in California right now, it's either we got too much and we got to figure out where to put it or we don't have enough and we got to figure out how to find it and treat it. And so I'm oversimplifying, but that's probably what I'd say. Bert Subin : Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Maybe just a cost side question. If we look at that bridge that you guys put in the deck going from 10.8% to 13.8%, can you just help us think through how much of that is cost cutting related and how much of that is just improved mix? Sounds like you're pretty bullish on the margin opportunity in P&PS. So is that a function of just you're getting better projects? Or is it more cost cutting? Or is it sort of 50-50? Robert Pragada : I'd say it's balanced. Probably 50-50. There's a 50% mix, but 50% is a leaner organization with now and we've started as of Q1, a level of recoverability and optimization of our cost structure rather than the straight variability of, if you're busy, you spend and if you're not, you cut, right? We want to get more of in the steady state. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference over to Bob Pragada for closing remarks. Robert Pragada : Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. A lot of exciting things happening in the business right now, and we look forward to giving you further updates in quarters to come. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Engineering Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ayan Banerjee, Senior Vice President, Finance, Treasury, Investor Relations, Corporate Development. Ayan, you may begin your conference. Ayan Banerjee : Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures, and operating metrics. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; and Interim CFO, Kevin Berryman. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities, then summarizing highlights from our second quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Ayan. Good day everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I want to welcome Kevin Berryman, previously our President and Chief Financial Officer back, following his appointment as interim CFO. Kevin brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role, having served as our CFO for over nine years. During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in navigating significant transformations and driving growth across our organization and most recently, has demonstrated exceptional leadership in overseeing the ongoing separation of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber Intelligence businesses as well as its planned strategic merger with Amentum. As we move forward, we have initiated to search for a permanent CFO with the assistance of an executive search firm. We are working towards concluding this search expeditiously and are grateful that Kevin has agreed to remain at Jacobs through the close of the separation transaction to provide overlap with our next CFO and ensure a smooth transition. Now, moving to Slide 4. I want to emphasize our solid progress on the cost optimization plan. We continue to prioritize simplifying our business model, optimizing our cost structure, expanding margins, and accelerating profitable growth across our lines of business. Our strategic shift towards a less complex, higher value, and higher margin portfolio remains on track. We are actively identifying opportunities to streamline our operating model and enhance efficiency, while continuing to deliver world-class value-added scientific-based, digitally-enabled solutions to create a more connected and sustainable world. We have made significant progress on our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber Intelligence separation planning. We're pleased to report that we have now achieved a significant milestone by receiving all approvals and clearances under competition and foreign direct investment laws that are conditioned to the separation transaction. We are steadily advancing our Form 10 filing targeted for early summer. We expect to fulfill the remaining closing conditions and complete the transaction in the second half of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Turning to Slide 5 and Q2. I'm pleased to report solid second quarter consolidated revenue, driven by 5% growth and 3% adjusted net revenue growth that is entirely organic. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year and gross margin in backlog increased approximately 50 basis points year-over-year, boosting confidence that our business will continue to deliver profitable growth. Turning to Slide 6. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another quarter of solid top line growth as we continue to execute against our strategy of prioritizing profitable growth over absolute growth. As demonstrated by P&PS, record adjusted operating margin of 15.3% and strong adjusted operating profit growth of 15.3% year-on-year. We continue to drive organic revenue growth up 7.5% and adjusted up 5.6% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS organic revenue growth of mid to high single-digits in FY 2024. During the quarter, we have delivered several marquee wins across multiple core market sectors. In transportation, we have been selected as Amtrak's delivery partner for the $6 billion Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, America's busiest passenger railroad, one of the largest national transportation and infrastructure investments and the most significant IIJA Award to-date. The team will provide program and construction management services from contract initiation through service commissioning for two high-capacity tunnel tubes for electrified passenger trains, improving rail systems and enhancing accessibility to transform this 10-mile section of the Northeast Corridor. PA Consulting is an integral part of our program management team, demonstrating their emerging presence in transport in the U.S. and the power of our collaborative partnership. In Aviation, we continue our long-term relationship with Los Angeles World Airports to provide program management services at Los Angeles International Airport. Infrastructure improvements at LAX will enhance the city's preparedness for upcoming sporting events, including the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. Water remains a critical growth catalyst with several strategic wins across our key geographies, further bolstering our position in the sector, as evidenced by our appointment by Miami-Dade County Water and Sewer Department to design upgrades for the county's three wastewater treatment plants, benefiting nearly 2.4 million residents and hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Jacobs will incorporate Intelligent O&M, a digital one water solution from its suite of digital products to provide our confident decision-making and to achieve greater efficiencies, reducing wastewater treatment costs, and optimizing operational labor. Additionally, we were selected by United Utilities, one of the U.K.'s largest listed water companies to its strategic solutions team supporting program optimization for major capital works through the AMP8 and AMP9 cycles, which cover the period from 2025 to 2035. Furthermore, we were selected by Water Corporation, the largest water utility in Western Australia to design, build, operate, and maintain the Alkimos Seawater Desalinization Plant in Perth, Australia. The project, part of an alliance with Water Corporation and ACCIONA is expected to ultimately produce 26 billion gallons of drinking water. In recent weeks, significant regulatory steps have been taken in the environmental sector. The U.S. EPA set maximum contaminant levels for five PFAS compounds. The first major U.S. drinking water legislation in 20 years and classified two PFAS compounds as hazardous under the Superfund program, expanding our potential for environmental management and compliance services. Internationally, the EU has also progressed, banning certain PFAS compounds and moving forward with risk evaluations. These developments are expected to increase demand for our consulting, engineering, and remediation services. We've been working with and advising our clients about how these anticipated regulations will impact them since discussions began some years ago. Now, that the regulations are finalized, we're having robust conversations with our clients about their options to navigate this next chapter. PA Consultant is working with companies that have PFAS materials in their products and advising on how to remove them from their products and supply chains as well as assessing how to create alternative materials. With our expertise, strong market presence, and leading position as demonstrated by our ongoing work with the Department of Defense, U.K. government, and Australian Aviation authorities, Jacobs is ready to lead in this evolving space. In Life Sciences, our overall pipeline continues to grow at double-digit rates year-over-year, driven by long-term relationships. There are significant opportunities in the pipeline and we are well-positioned for continued growth. In CMS, Q2 revenue was up 3% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit increased 10% with approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. The CMS team is executing well, and we continue to see several positive trends for long-term growth as the team prepares for the merger with Amentum. PA Consulting delivered among an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 20.5% with solid execution and cost discipline. We continue to expect the remaining quarters in FY 2024 to exceed 20% adjusted operating margin. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator for us with some nice wins in the quarter, including the previously mentioned Frederick Douglass Tunnel and an appointment to the HM Revenue & Customs multibillion-pound framework in the U.K., intended to upgrade software systems across the government agency. Divergent Solutions delivered a solid adjusted operating margin performance at approximately 10% and adjusted operating profit growth, which would have been approximately 13% excluding a large license sale to Palantir in the comparison period. Our suite of digital products and platforms are elevating the value we can provide to our clients globally. In summary, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our core market sectors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q2 results, leading to another strong quarter. We are steadfast in our commitment to providing high-value solutions with improved margins, supported by our continued emphasis on operational excellence and execution. So, let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 7. Second quarter gross revenue grew 5% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue grew 3%. GAAP operating profit was $281 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $58 million of transaction, restructuring, and other costs, including $47 million associated with the separation transaction. We still expect our total restructuring cost to be approximately $275 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by the separation transaction. Our adjusted operating margin was 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.29 per share and included a $0.28 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.34 from transaction, restructuring, and other related costs, all of which were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.91, marking a 7% decrease compared to the previous year. When adjusting for last year's second quarter discrete tax benefit of $0.32, our current non-GAAP EPS represents an approximately 10% year-over-year increase. Looking forward, we anticipate maintaining an annual effective tax rate of 22% for the full fiscal year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $393 million and was up 10% year-over-year, representing a strong 11.3% adjusted net revenue. Finally, backlog was up 2% year-over-year. The revenue book-to-bill ratio was 0.96 times with our gross profit and backlog increasing 4% year-over-year. Excluding a one-time change in government funding strategy with regard to Space ISR programs, which I'll describe in more detail during my segment comments, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been approximately 1.06 times, with significant strength in pipeline growth and expected large wins in Q3 and Q4. Regarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 8. We are particularly pleased with our performance in People & Places Solutions. Q2 adjusted net revenue was up 5.6% year-over-year. Adjusted operating profit growth was strong at 15.3%. Reflecting our commitment to higher end profitable growth, the segment saw a record adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see solid momentum in both growth and profitability in the business. Our backlog has grown by 2% year-over-year and we've seen a 7% increase in the gross profit in our backlog. This improvement reflects our ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of our bids and project wins as we expect some critical large wins to occur in Q3. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q2 revenue increased 3.2% year-over-year with backlog up 3.9%. Our adjusted operating profit was up 10.3% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year as the business continued to find avenues of operational improvements. While a recent program loss will put some short-term pressure on the second half, our recent successes in shorter-cycle awards is expected to help mitigate the impact. Our work remains mission-critical, allowing the business to show long-term resilience against shifts in government funding and program adjustments. Let's now focus on Divergent Solutions. During Q2, we observed an 11% year-over-year decrease in adjusted net revenue and 24% decrease year-over-year in adjusted operating profit. Excluding a one-time Palantir license in the previous period, adjusted operating profit would have been up 13% year-over-year. While backlog was negatively impacted by a change in funding strategy with the DoD on space-based ISR programs, we are encouraged by the positive momentum in near-term sales, which we believe will contribute to our ongoing success. Now, let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q2 saw a slight decline of 2% in year-over-year revenue, driven by a continued challenging macro environment in the consulting industry and a solid year ago comparable. However, cost and execution discipline helped deliver a strong adjusted operating margin of 20.5%, a 270 basis point increase from the previous sequential quarter. As we emphasized during our last earnings call, our industry position is uniquely differentiated and our work is both purposeful and critical. As a result, PA continues to deliver ongoing positive momentum in bookings and pipeline growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong adjusted operating profit margins, targeting above 20% for the second half of the year. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $59 million in Q2. We continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model and driving costs down. We expect this line item post separation to trend towards $50 million per quarter or $200 million annually. Turning to Slide 9 to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. After delivering a strong free cash flow in Q1, our quarterly free cash flow was negative $71 million in Q2 as working capital increased the planned levels from the exceptional performance in Q1. Despite this impact in the second quarter, our reported free cash flow conversion for the first half of the year has remained at approximately 100%. And as a result, we are well-positioned to deliver on our forecast, maintaining 100% reported as well as adjusted free cash flow conversion for the full year. Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $95 million of shares during the quarter, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We still have $679 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we have said, we will remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders, while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. We ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and gross debt of $3 billion. Our Q2 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.3 times remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the strength of the balance sheet, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt having become current in Q2. We have ample options : refinancing, using proceeds from our upcoming separation transaction, and/or accessing our revolver. As of the end of Q2, approximately 37% of our debt is tied to floating rate debt, and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.2%. Finally, given our strong balance sheet and year-to-date free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29, an 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on June 21st. Bob, back over to you. Robert Pragada : Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 10. Due to our continued momentum across our business, we feel confident in our ability to reach our previously stated objectives. As a result, we are narrowing the range for fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion, and adjusted EPS to $7.80 to $8.10, representing a 9% and 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoints, respectively. This guidance incorporates Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.91 and a 26% to 27% adjusted effective tax rate each quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, this represents a 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year ago period. In closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market and we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone. Robert Pragada : Hi, good morning Andy. Kevin Berryman : Good morning Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Bob or Kevin, can you give us more color into what's going on with Jacobs' backlog and how to think about it going forward? I know that you said backlog in People & Places is up about 2% year-over-year, but can you elaborate a bit more on the larger prospects you're talking about for Q3? Do you see a nice acceleration in backlog growth in the second half in People & Places? And then maybe just a change in the space-based ISR impacting Divergent, that business is going with CMS, the deal or correct, but could you give us some more color on what happened there? Robert Pragada : Sure. So, maybe I'll start off with P&PS and then Kevin can talk about kind of the entirety. So, in P&PS, Andy, a couple of things. One is timing. We've got -- let me first off by saying that as a gross number, the P&PS backlog represents a record backlog for the segment since we formed it nearly five years ago. So, kind of point one there. As far as the growth, we've kind of got tied a little bit into some timing of some of the larger programs that drive the backlog. Our book-to-bill is still over 1, and in the second half with expected awards, some of which we've already received in the first month of the quarter, we're going to see a real acceleration in the backlog in P&PS. Kevin, you want to talk about the overall as well as Divergent? Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, I think the dynamics associated with Divergent and you're right, that part of the business is going to be part of the separation, so it's in the parameter of the separation transaction, Andy. And look, there was a change in funding strategy, whereby the technology and associated projects that we have are still considered viable and probably the best technologies to be utilizing going forward, but because of deciding how they were going to be funding it, DoD is handing over that responsibility to the intelligence community. So, while long-term, we have a reduction -- well, short-term, we have a reduction in our backlog because the DoD is handing that over, we're starting to, right now, see immediate build back up in some of those projects being now embedded into the intelligence community. While it represents certainly a delay in some of the burn of that project, our expectation is longer term, that DVS will start to see that same backlog come back into their kind of backlog over the course of the next year-plus, and consequently, we'll have to build up the burn once again. And so if you think about those two dynamics, I think those are kind of short-term dynamics when you include People & Places. And when you see the outlook for the rest of the year, we're feeling pretty good about our backlog growth and book-to-bill over the balance of the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then just People & Places margins, obviously very good performance. I know you've been sort of allocating corporate costs. Maybe how much did you end up allocating to the segment? And can you talk about whether you're actually in a better trajectory than you guided when you talked about it being better than the 14.6 that you did last year in People & Places? Robert Pragada : Yes. So, on the first part, that allocation hasn't changed since we talked about it last quarter, so that's remained consistent. And we're not going to change that philosophy. Really, this quarter, the mix that we saw specifically around Water and Life Sciences, when we think about it, those are two segments, Andy, that are growing at double-digit rates. And from a pipeline standpoint, I mean, both are nearly -- the pipelines are doubling on a year-on-year basis. So, that mix of higher-margin work that's coming in is really driving that growth. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Kevin, welcome back even though that you really didn't leave. Thanks. Kevin Berryman : Thanks Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judah Aronovitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Judah Aronovitz : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Calling in for Steve Fisher. First question is, what has changed in the background in the second half that drove your guidance change? Robert Pragada : Can you say that again? I'm sorry. Kevin Berryman : Sorry, didn't follow the question. Judah Aronovitz : Yes, sorry. I guess what's changed in the background that drove your guidance change? Like anything going on in the second half that is maybe different than your prior expectations? Kevin Berryman : No. Look, I think at the end of the day, we feel as if we're being prudent in our guidance, and it still represents a 13% year-over-year kind of increase in EPS. So, I think at the end, we're sitting here saying, that's a good ending result. We're being prudent in the establishment of that. And of course, it's offsetting some of the things that we know are already in our numbers, the inventory write-offs that we had in the first quarter. So, I think it's quite actually a positive. Judah Aronovitz : Okay, that's helpful. And my second question is about project selectivity. How is that playing out in your business and what kind of projects are you saying no to, and how often are you saying no? thank you. Robert Pragada : Yes. Project selectivity is -- we've always had that. And that has become kind of a primary focus for us as the opportunities have increased. Talk a little bit about Water and Life Sciences, in our Transportation business right now, our win rates have been the highest, you could say, in the highest in the market. And they've been the highest that we've experienced, and a lot of that comes from because it's subjective evaluation from what we put our effort and our money behind on trending. Probably the biggest component of that is around long-term client relationships. We're not out looking for work. We've been with our clients for decades. And if you think about 3,700 clients around the world and over the course of the last 20 years, that's a 2% client turnover. And so when we're with a client, we're there for the long-term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning Bob and Kevin, and welcome back as well. Robert Pragada : Hi Mike. Kevin Berryman : Thanks Mike. Michael Dudas : Bob, you mentioned in your prepared remarks life science and an expanded pipeline. And maybe generally in Life Science, semi data centers, some of the more facilities work, the conversion timing and level relative to those businesses? I certainly haven't a diversity help. So maybe you can share a little bit about how that plays through and maybe through the second half, which might incorporate some of those projects you're talking about and still the momentum from the client work that you're seeing into 2025. Robert Pragada : Sure. So maybe I'll start with in sciences and then talk about semi kind of the electronics world right now. I mentioned this before, Mike, within our life sciences world, you've heard a lot about GLP-1 and everything is going around the obesity drug. If you look at the two biggest ones that are in that space, our work that we do for them represents nearly over 50% of the capital that they put in place. So that work continues to be a big driver. But what's also happening is two other dynamics. One is around oncology. There are quite a few advances that are happening around oncology. And so timing on those was maybe a little slower than we wanted over the course of the last few quarters. But going into the second half, those jobs are right in front of us, and we're well positioned for those. The last dynamic around Life Sciences is just sheer capacity. Here, the CEOs of life sciences companies and biotech companies talk about capacity as the biggest choke point. The contract manufacturing world is on the rise as well. So we'll have some good news here in the second half and actually in Q3 around what's going on in that contract manufacturing space. Semiconductor, a lot of stuff in the news right now about the ubiquitous world of chip manufacturing and how AI is driving not just chip manufacturing but also data centers. We're seeing that. The chips money has now been delivered to the market, and some of the largest players have benefited from that. So we're seeing projects that we've already been involved with talk about Phase 2 of those. And so we'll have more to say as those become public in the second half, but it's really the entirety of the ecosystem of the chip manufacturing and semiconductor world. Starting from the R&D facility through manufacturing and now you'll hear a lot more about test and assembly and those test and assembly facilities coming to the US. So, we're excited about what's going on. And then in data centers, the power usage of these are creating opportunities for us with regards to power and cooling, the water requirements on now what could be 1 gigawatt data center. So, really, really positive story there. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Bob. And my follow-up is maybe for either one on PA. How do you see the macro in the second half of the year and certainly seems like internal opportunities are helping drive a bit more on the margin? And is there an opportunity to get some more maybe profit growth along with some net revenue growth into 2025 as you're looking at it today? Robert Pragada : Yes. Maybe I'll make a couple of comments on the opportunities and on backlog, and then Kevin can talk about the margins. What gets embedded in is the PA backlog was actually up 8% year-over-year. And so we're starting to see that momentum of those opportunities and those collaborative opportunities come through. So that's exciting news there. And a lot around the U.K. macro has been driving the business with at least hopefully some clarity that there'll be an election in the U.K. in the second half of the year, we're already starting to see the pipeline grow in the sales performance in the last month of the quarter kind of drove the business. So, the momentum is there. And then given we're talking about the margin. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, I think the team has done a really good job, Mike, relative to rightsizing the organization, given some of the challenges in the overall consulting industry, which obviously is impacting PA to a certain extent. But they're very well positioned, especially in the U.K. market. And so we're feeling good about their ability to be delivering that 20% plus margin in the back half of the year. And so longer term, I think that, that translates into numbers going on from there as well. And look, I think as we enter the end of the calendar year, we do have the dynamic of the U.K. election. So, we're going to have to watch that carefully to see what impacts are -- but what we have right now is pretty clear visibility on our Q3 and Q4 reported numbers in terms of the health of the PA business, not substantial growth, but certainly good solid execution in the balance of the fiscal year for us. Michael Dudas : Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. One on people in places, the margins implied in the back half of the year, Kevin, I think, are down relative to where we were in the second quarter. I know you spoke to mix. But with backlog -- with gross margins and backlog being up, I'm just wondering what's going on there? Or is there just some level of conservatism in your margin guidance? And then my second question, just on the large awards that you're expecting in the back half of the year. I'm assuming that you don't need any of these awards to make your guide for 2024. So I guess I'll start with those. Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Well, let me start on the first one. Look, I think 15.3% that we saw people in place is a record, is at a high level. And consequently, I don't think we can assume that every quarter is going to be 15.3% just because of the factors associated with cost of mix and what actually hit us during a particular quarter. I will say that as we think about our margin profile, we're feeling better about it today than we felt last quarter. So I can characterize it from that perspective. It doesn't mean we're going to hit 15.3% in Q3 and Q4, but I think we're going to end the year at numbers that are going to be pretty darn attractive. Robert Pragada : And then on the awards, Jamie, those are -- when I say are they part of the guide or not part of the guide, our guide incorporates the probability waiting for the award. But we're feeling optimistic about not just the award anticipated awards, but the pipeline. The pipeline is looking extremely robust in PPS. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sangita Jain : Yes. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I just wanted to ask about Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom seems to be scaling back on parts of the NEOM project. So I just wanted to hear what you guys are hearing and what your exposure there might look like? Robert Pragada : Sure. So maybe I'll just talk about broadly Saudi and then specifically on NEOM. Broadly, Saudi, the pipeline of work continues. And it's -- for us, it's a diverse pipeline. We don't index towards a specific type of offering. We've got value-added services that we provide to the entire life cycle of these programs. And if you look at the pipeline, the infrastructure component of it, the transportation, whether it be in aviation or in rail as well as the water opportunities that we've had have been pretty robust. So, we just announced a major expansion of the Riyadh, the new Riyadh airport that's going on that's in full force as well as the water infrastructure that we're putting in place. Our exposure on NEOM, even with the pullback on NEOM as far as the 170 kilometers, the work that's going on right now has not ours has not abated and continues to go on schedule for not just the personal canal that we're dedicating towards the job, but the growth that we see in the job as well. Sangita Jain : That's super helpful. And if I can ask, you gave us a rundown of a lot of your key end markets. Maybe just a little bit on the power and energy market and what you may be seeing there here as well as in the U.K. on power, transmission and renewables? Robert Pragada : Sure. So, overall, solid -- the work that we're seeing both in Southeast Asia, in Australia, New Zealand and in Europe. And Europe, clearly driven by the geopolitical kind of impact that it's had on energy transition that continues. The interconnectors that we are, not just in the middle of in Europe, but the additional pursuits that we have in place kind of put some tailwinds there. I'd say in the US, it's been not just a market on its own, but it's also been an enabling market, our expertise around renewables and then taking that energy expertise in taking it to areas such as data centers and the EV ecosystem with regards to transportation. That's probably been a greater level of focus in the U.S. So kind of the diversity of our skill sets is really helping that energy and power group that we have. Again, it started off from a smaller base, but it's doubled in size just in the year. Sangita Jain : Good. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard : Hi. Good morning, guys. Robert Pragada : Hi, good morning, Chad. Kevin Berryman : Good morning, Chad Chad Dillard : So, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the PFAS legislation that was just handed down. Just trying to get a sense for how to think about timing for potential awards in your backlog, like what's the design cycle for that? And then can you also talk about how Jacobs is positioned to win there? Robert Pragada : Yes. So Chad, you probably heard this before. Kind of the $200 billion that spans over the course of the next 25 years, that is across multiple end markets. And so we can see a direct time line to that over a long period of time as regulations continue to become more and more part of the law. The way PFAS -- within the DoD, DoD agencies, specifically the Navy and the Air Force as well as the Corps of Engineers, that's showing up as individual pursuits, and it's kind of in that $75 million to $100 million of annual revenue for us as an offering. What you don't see is probably the bigger piece of PFAS, which is in drinking water. And so the work that the PFAS remediation and PFAS consulting that we do within a water offering or within a -- whether it be water treatment or wastewater reclamation project, that continues to grow. So, to look at this as an incremental is going to be a little cloudy, but to see it as a catalyst for scope growth on existing work is kind of how we're looking at it. And these are, like I said on the first question, these are clients that we've had for a long time and will continue to be a critical part of our offering. Chad Dillard : That's helpful. And then just over on the infrastructure side, specifically on transportation. Can you talk about like how your pipeline is evolving? How's it changed this quarter versus maybe a year ago? Any color on that would be helpful. Robert Pragada : Sure. Pipeline growth is there, probably more indexed towards the US in what's the IIJA focus that's come through and you've seen that in some of our awards. So, I'd say the larger rail opportunities we talked about last quarter, we talked about this quarter, those continue. The highways work is continuing to grow. And then in Australia and in the Middle East as well, we're seeing continued growth in transport. I'd say that, the areas that as there's more stability that comes within the U.K., that we could see the growth coming in would be in the U.K. And then what's differentiating us amongst our -- not just our competitive pool, but creating more value for our clients is how we're enabling that with our digital platforms. So the use of StreetLight Data not just in our own work but how that's kind of almost revolutionizing our offering to clients is something that we've got it firmly embedded in the US. But we're now starting to see use cases come about both in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East and soon to come in Australia. Chad Dillard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Baird. Please go ahead. Justin Hauke : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just -- I wanted to clarify one thing on the guidance. The CMS outlook for the back half of the year, I think previously you guys were talking about kind of a mid-single-digit constant currency growth rate. It's a little bit below in the first half, but I think you were talking about some program losses that are going to pressure the second half. And so I just wanted to make sure that we understood kind of what that commentary meant and what your expectations are for the revenue growth in the back half of the year at CMS? Kevin Berryman : Yes, Justin, we did have a loss, one, one that was somewhat sizable which impacts the, I would say, the short-term and I would call short-term Q3, Q4. While we have a lot of short-cycle awards that are filling in the gap fundamentally offsetting and mitigating the impacts of that, it probably puts us in -- in the short run to be more flattish as opposed to seeing the growth of single-digits, mid-single-digits. So, I think that's the dynamic at least in Q3, Q4. I would remind you that this is the business that is going to be transferred over. But I would tell you, the team is doing an amazing job in filling in and positioning for exiting 2024, putting itself back in a place to be seeing incremental growth in 2025. Robert Pragada : And maybe just one thing to add. The operational efficiencies that the team has really delivered through that double-digit bottom-line growth for this quarter, and we mentioned it last quarter as well, with operating margins that are now the highest that we've seen in the business is another real highlight for what we're doing within CMS. Kevin Berryman : And that's a good point, Bob, because we shouldn't be seeing impacts on the margin profile, even though we're discussing this one item. But the team has done a really nice job on the margin front. Justin Hauke : Okay. Thank you for clarifying. And I guess my second one is just to ask on the corporate unallocated costs. The trending down to the $50 million, you're not expecting that line item to come down until post separation though, right? So, this kind of $58 million that you've had the last two quarters, that's kind of the run rate for the balance of the year. And then with the spin, that's when you would expect like the step function change in the first quarter of 25%. Is that still the right way to kind of think about it? Kevin Berryman : That's correct. Justin Hauke : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Kevin Berryman : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Sahej Singh : Bob, Kevin, good morning. This is Sahej on for Bert. Robert Pragada : Hi. Good morning. Kevin Berryman : Hi. Sahej Singh : It seems like a lot of good questions have been asked. So I will ask about IIJA ramp. I think we've heard commentary more broadly from the industry and then even for you guys of an expectation of IIJA funding ramp to around 2026 or 2027. Are you still seeing that trend? Are you seeing that trend faster than expected? Any color there would be helpful. Robert Pragada : No, it's kind of still trending to that. We -- the trend on the new awards and how that money flows, 2026, 2027, I think we've mentioned last quarter that, that looks like it could get extended, but that's not because it's slowing down right now, because it started later than what was anticipated. But these awards that we've not just talked about today, but also what we've telegraphed for the second half of the year. Those are really being catalyzed by IIJA. Sahej Singh : That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on the prior question related to unallocated expenses. You've given good visibility into the post spin. I think I look at it as I was quickly doing the math, you're trending at about 2% on a trailing 12-month sales, so maybe on a percentage basis trailing 12-month post spin, where are you looking to get? I think it's been elevated post your PA Consulting acquisition in 2021? Kevin Berryman : Well, look, I don't have the -- we're not targeting a percentage. We're targeting an absolute number, which we've communicated. There's a lot of moving pieces in that, which I just want to highlight, for example, we're conveying cost of the new organization. Part of our corporate infrastructure is going to be conveyed. There is going to be TSA revenue that we will receive from the transition period. So there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think it's safe to say that we're going to be targeting that number to be at that $50 net number at the end of the day as we go into 2025, got a lot of work to be able to execute against that. And look, the amount of effort that's being expended in this company right now relative to ensuring that we're creating a stand-alone entity that's going to be able to day one look to accelerate its level of growth given its effective focus on the government service side is not inconsequential. And I just want to reinforce that because it has impacts relative to the short-term ability for us to further reduce numbers at the end of the day. I can't tell you how pleased and proud I am actually of the teams, not only those that are actually dedicated to the separation and standup management office, but the rest of the organization, which is getting pulled away from their day jobs to help support the separation. So we're feeling really good about it. Sahej Singh : Thank you. And then just last one for me is you mentioned the Riyadh airport. I think I saw some news flow on Dubai potentially expanding their airport. Is that a project that you guys are actively interested in pursuing on our in conversations around? Any color there would be incrementally helpful as a tailwind into the Middle East region more specifically? Robert Pragada : Yes and yes. It's our presence in Dubai on multifaceted infrastructure work, water, transportation and within transportation and aviation is reaching. We've been there for a decade, and that will continue to be a primary area of focus for us within the Middle East. And so the answer is yes. Sahej Singh : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone. Robert Pragada : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Bob, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the data center opportunity for you folks. What does the scope of CapEx looks like for data centers for you folks compared to semi-cap equipment and your market share when we last spoke, the outlook for data center CapEx was, I don't know, probably 30% lower. So, I'm wondering, as you think about the outlook for advanced facilities could growth actually accelerate if your content on data centers is remotely similar to what it is for the semi-cap equipment? Thanks. Robert Pragada : Yes, Jerry, if you look at data centers as a percentage of -- from a deployed capital perspective of a percentage of kind of call it the electronics universe, it is just -- this is not Jacobs. It's just -- it is a minority share of the billions that get put into chip manufacturing and then the entire life cycle of the chip delivery profile to the market. So, that's kind of point one. But the rate of growth really driven by AI and the needs for these data centers is what's driving our business. So we see that growing. From a pure design perspective, these are not overall -- the facility itself is not the real complicated component. What's becoming more complicated are the power needs and the cooling needs, the water needs. So, that's what our teams are really focused in on. You've seen probably some of the bigger power management companies Eaton and Schneider and others talk about how it's driving their business that goes into the hardware that's going into data centers. But the consultancy piece, that power and water usage is going to be a bigger piece of how we kind of expand that value proposition there. Jerry Revich : And in terms of within People & Places, really good top line growth and you mentioned there's some bookings coming up. Can you just calibrate us which of your end markets were the biggest drivers of growth in the quarter and based on what's in backlog and bookings, which end markets do you expect to be above segment average growth over the next couple of quarters? Robert Pragada : Water and Life Sciences. Those two right now, even as far as rates at a point in time that represents probably over 50% of that P&PS growth. And then when we look at the pipeline moving forward, those are pipelines that are, as I mentioned before, doubling in size, and that's global. So, areas that might have some geo-economic challenges such as the U.K. If you look at the water bookings and the growth in water in those geographies, that's growing. And of course, that's been a driver, both in the U.S. as well as in Australia and the Middle East, too. So Life Sciences Europe and U.S. wire globally. Jerry Revich : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. Josh Sullivan : Hey, good morning. Robert Pragada : Hi, good morning, Josh. Josh Sullivan : Can you just comment maybe on labor availability, inflation retention on a geographic basis? Where is it still hot? Or is it getting a little better? Robert Pragada : Yes. It's not all over. And as far as wage inflation, we still -- it's there, but our ability to kind of look at value-added solutions for our clients and looking on how we can continue to deliver at a price point that drives the capital deployment from our clients. That has not really changed as we continue to innovate in that space. What's really helped us, Josh, has been our global delivery model. If we look at the engagements that we have, whether they be smaller consultancy engagements or larger programs, these jobs and these engagements with our clients have literally got people from all over our global delivery platforms. And so -- and we're going to continue with that because it's not necessarily the cost arbitrage that might be an outcome, but it's the talent arbitrage, and our talent is literally in every geography that we have today. So it has not really been a big issue for us. Josh Sullivan : Got it. And then just on the short-cycle wins you mentioned in the comments there, where specifically were those? Any structural shift in focus or is that just opportunistic? Robert Pragada : No. It's probably been focused around telecom, weapon sustainment, and then some scope growth that we see in our aerospace work as well. Josh Sullivan : Got it. Thank you for the time. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the conference back over to Bob Pragada for closing remarks. Robert Pragada : Thank you, everyone, for joining our earnings call. We really look forward to providing further updates and visiting with all of you and investors and analysts in the months to come, and look forward to engaging first hand. Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Solutions Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ayan Banerjee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Ayan, you may begin your conference. Ayan Banerjee : Thank you. Good morning. Our earnings announcement was filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will refer during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' CEO, Bob Pragada; Special Adviser to the CEO, Kevin Berryman; as well as our new CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and then summarizing highlights from our third quarter results. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics. Venk will then provide a review of our balance sheet and cash flow and provide comments around our guidance and Investor Day. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks and then we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I will turn it over to CEO, Bob Pragada. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Ayan. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2024 business performance. I'm joined today by my Special Adviser, Kevin Berryman, who acted as Interim CFO into June, and will therefore report our financials. I'm delighted to also welcome our new CFO, Venk Nathamuni, on his first earnings call for Jacobs. Venk joined us in June and will provide details on guidance. Venk brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise from his 30-plus year career, and I am excited to work in partnership with him moving forward. Kevin will continue in his role as special adviser to me to drive a successful conclusion to the separation and merger of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses with the Amentum. I'd like to extend my gratitude for Kevin for our ongoing support. Now moving to Slide 4. We continue to make progress on our strategic shift toward a simpler, higher value, higher margin portfolio and remain confident in driving margin expansion over the coming years. Turning to Slide 5. I am pleased to report significant progress on the previously announced planned spin-off of our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses. An updated Form-10 was publicly filed yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing made under Amazon Holdco, Inc. includes important business and financial information about the intended merger with Amentum to create a leading publicly traded global government services provider. Amentum will provide additional details during their Capital Markets Day on Tuesday, August 13, 2024. The transaction is now anticipated to be completed in the second half of September 2024. Turning to Slide 6 and Q3. I will now share our third quarter achievements, highlighted by strong backlog growth, consolidated margin expansion and P&PS record backlog and strong adjusted operating margin. This period saw a continuation of a mix shift to higher-margin science-based consulting and advisory services that offers significantly higher returns, contributing to an overall margin expansion, notably led by P&PS and our partnership with PA Consulting. We are seeing an accelerating demand for critical infrastructure, particularly in water, environmental and advanced facilities end markets, which are poised for substantial growth. Consolidated backlog increased 6% year-over-year bolstering confidence that our business will accelerate profitable growth as we strategically shift our portfolio to higher value, higher margin solutions. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA came in at $392 million, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period last year and representing 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. From a cash perspective, we started the second half of the year by delivering very strong operating cash flow of $483 million and free cash flow of $445 million. We continue to expect exceeding 100% reported free cash flow conversion in fiscal year 2024, underscoring the power of our business model. Turning to Slide 7. People & Places Solutions line of business reported another -- of solid top line growth, along with strong adjusted operating margins of 15.3% and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% year-on-year. We ended Q3 with a strong book-to-bill of 1.53x and record backlog. Adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and we continue to expect P&PS -- solid P&PS organic revenue growth for Q4 fiscal year 2024. I'm particularly pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins in core sectors such as water, environmental and advanced facilities, a testament to our robust market positioning, deep domain expertise and long-term trusted client relationships. We achieved double-digit growth in our water and environmental markets with two thirds of our water-related business focused in on high-value science-based consulting and advisory services, driven by aging infrastructure and emerging PFAS regulations. Water continues to be a foundational element of our portfolio, exemplified by key wins across various geographies, reinforcing our global leadership in the sector. Europe, particularly the UK, has shown resilience, posting a robust quarter in water-related awards. In Asia, we were appointed by PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency to engineer and program manage the new Kranji Water Reclamation Plant designed to enhance Northern Singapore's water treatment capacity by 120 million imperial gallons per day. Additionally, our partnership with Onondaga County, the Syracuse metropolitan area in Central New York, which began in 2008, continues as they've chosen us to provide program management services for their efforts in controlling increased combined sewer outflow and utilizes our Digital OneWater solutions. This expansion will be critical in remediating aging water infrastructure and supporting industrial growth in the geography. We're excited by the continued momentum in pipeline build in our advanced facilities portfolio, predominantly driven by life sciences, semiconductor manufacturing and AI chip driven data center expansion. Specifically in life sciences, we continue to see robust growth with our pipeline and revenue growing double digits year-over-year. Approximately two thirds of our life sciences related business is concentrated in high-value science-based consulting and advisory services. We were selected by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies to support the $1.2 billion expansion of their large-scale biologics facility -- biologics manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina, providing engineering, procurement and program management services with the first phase of construction expected to complete in 2025. We continue to see a growing pipeline in transportation and energy and power supported by ongoing government stimulus. As an example, in transportation, we were selected to provide program management services for Broward County Transportation Department's first-ever public transit expansion. This $4.4 billion 30-year initiative will transform the county's transportation infrastructure into a multimodal transit system with a new light rail connecting Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport to Port Everglades. Additionally, the quarter was highlighted by several key wins in the energy and sustainability space as demonstrated by our appointment as program manager for the ARCHES Hydrogen Consortium and master service agreement with Shell Energy in Australia. PA Consulting delivered an industry-leading adjusted operating margin of 21.8% with robust execution and cost discipline. Our partnership with PA continues to be a differentiator in our science-based consulting and advisory services. Together with PA, we were selected in the Hertfordshire County, UK to enhance the public highways network in the county with services valued at approximately $22 million annually. This collaboration focuses on sustainability and aims to deliver long-term value over an initial five-year period with potential extensions up to 14 years. In Divergent Solutions, we are encouraged by the ongoing demand for our digitally enabled infrastructure solutions that will remain with independent Jacobs post close. A testament to our capabilities is our recent selection by the City of Omaha to develop a data analytics and AI-enabled support system for its wastewater network, utilizing Jacobs Digital OneWater Solutions, Aqua DNA. CMS delivered 35 basis points of margin expansion, the highest in 10 quarters and has a strong pipeline. Additionally, we're experiencing encouraging trends that support long-term growth as we approach the merger with Amentum. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to win higher value, higher-margin solutions and deliver superior execution to meet our clients' expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review our financial results in further detail. Kevin Berryman : Thank you, Bob. We are pleased with our Q3 results, leading to another solid quarter. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter on Slide 8. Third quarter gross revenue grew 1% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue also grew 1%. GAAP operating profit was $260 million for the quarter and included $53 million of amortization from acquired intangibles and $73 million of transaction, restructuring and other costs including $62 million associated with the separation transaction. We now expect our total restructuring costs to be approximately $300 million for the fiscal year, materially driven by higher separation transaction costs associated with our anticipated close now targeted during the second half of September 2024. Our adjusted operating margin was again a strong 11.3%. I'll discuss the underlying dynamics during the reporting segment review. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $1.17 per share and included a $0.31 impact related to the amortization charge of acquired intangibles and $0.49 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, which again were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.96, marking an 11% increase compared to the previous year. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $392 million and was up 11% year-over-year, representing an 11.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. Finally, consolidated backlog was up 6% year-over-year and the revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.29x with our gross profit and backlog increasing 5.5% year-over-year. Regarding the performance of our lines of business in the quarter, let's turn to Slide 9. Starting with People & Places Solutions. Q3 adjusted net revenue was up 5% year-over-year with adjusted operating profit up 12%. Our mix shift mentioned earlier, resulted in higher margins on lower revenue growth. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% was up 95 basis points year-over-year. Our backlog grew by 10% year-over-year, while gross profit in backlog grew 9%. This quarter's critical wins underscore our strength in water, environmental and advanced facilities, reinforcing our leadership position in these key markets. These wins translated into a book-to-bill of 1.53x and a record backlog, as previously mentioned by Bob. Moving to Critical Mission Solutions. Our Q3 revenue decreased 3% year-over-year, while backlog was up 4%. Excluding the announced contract loss mentioned in the prior quarter, our revenue would have been up slightly year-over-year. Our adjusted operating profit was up 1.2% year-over-year, while CMS adjusted operating margin rose by approximately 35 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%, the highest margin in 10 quarters as the business continues to drive operational improvements and margin-enhancing client-facing projects. Shifting to Divergent Solutions. Q3 saw an 11% year-over-year dip in adjusted net revenue and a 40% year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating profit, driven by a one-time year-to-date government rate adjustment and the space-based ISR program delays that were mentioned in the prior quarter. Despite the strategic shift in funding with the DoD, we continue to see positive momentum in our space-based ISR technology adoption leading to pipeline build and expected future backlog growth. Now let's turn our attention to PA Consulting. Q3 saw a modest increase in year-over-year revenue. However, PA delivered a strong adjusted operating margin of 21.8%, reflecting a 60 basis point improvement from the previous year. Our margin results this quarter exceeded our expectations and reinforces our confidence in sustaining a strong margin profile as we continue to expect 20% plus margins in Q4. Backlog increased 4% year-over-year, and we expect improved growth as we enter fiscal year 2025. Our adjusted unallocated corporate costs were $61 million in Q3, and we continue to make progress on simplifying and optimizing our operating model to drive costs down. Finally, I am very excited to welcome Venk to the team. We've been working together closely and I -- and we have made great progress on ensuring a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn the call over to Venk. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, Kevin. Let me begin by saying I'm very excited to be part of the Jacobs team and a special thanks to Kevin for his partnership and support. I'll now provide a quick overview of our balance sheet and cash flow metrics, followed by consolidated full year guidance. Turning to Slide 10. We posted a strong quarter of cash flow generation, which is indicative of the quality of our earnings and cash conversion. We generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $445 million. Year-to-date, our free cash flow conversion was well above 100%, leading to a full year expectation of greater than 100%. Regarding capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $151 million of shares during the quarter, which was up $55 million compared to Q2, reflecting our commitment to delivering consistent return of capital to our shareholders. We have $528 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization. And as we've stated before, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders while remaining committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of $1.2 billion and gross debt of $2.9 billion and our Q3 net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.1x remains a clear indication of the continued strength of our balance sheet. Given the strength, we feel comfortable with a portion of our debt remaining current in the fiscal year. We have ample options, refinancing as well as using proceeds from the expected separation transaction for repaying the current amounts. As of the end of Q3, approximately 37% of our debt was tied to floating rates and our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. On the dividend front, we remain committed to growing our quarterly dividend. The Board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.29 and 11.5% year-over-year increase to be paid on August 2023. Now turning to Slide 11. Given the solid execution thus far, we're narrowing our consolidated adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $7.85 to $8.05, representing 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be near the lower end of the $1.54 billion to $1.585 billion range. This guidance incorporates Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.96 and approximately 27% adjusted effective tax rate for the remainder of this fiscal year. Additionally, this represents 13% EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 versus the year-ago period. Our expectation is that the ongoing positive momentum in our business will lead to increased revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 compared to our current levels. Once we close the separation transaction, we anticipate an immediate shift in our company's growth profile, positioning us solidly for higher growth and higher margins. As Bob mentioned earlier, the anticipated separation transaction close date is now in the second half of September 2024. As a result, we expect Q3 to be the last quarter in which the results of the separated businesses will be included in our continuing operations. Beginning next quarter, we expect our results for our continuing operations to reflect the new independent Jacobs. Historical results for independent Jacobs will be available following the close of the transaction. And lastly, we're excited to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Day for independent Jacobs on February 18, 2025, in Miami, Florida. We look forward to sharing our long-term strategy as well as our financial target model with the investor community during this event. Additional details will be forthcoming, and we look forward to your participation. And with that, now I'll turn the call back to Bob. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Venk. In closing, we are invigorated as demand for our science-based digitally-enabled solutions remains strong, with clients continuing to select Jacobs to address their most complex challenges. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum in the critical infrastructure market, and we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across key sectors. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen, and welcome. Thanks. Bob Pragada : Good morning, Mike. Michael Dudas : Thank you. Yes. Maybe just first to talk about your improvement in the gross margins in the P&PS backlog that you reported this quarter up 9%. Maybe a characteristic of the mix impact, is there any industries or end markets that have contributed more to that? And I guess as my follow-up, as you're looking towards fiscal 2025 and the pipeline you have and a very strong book-to-bill you had, how confident do you believe that you can show backlog and net revenue organic growth moving ahead into 2025, given where your position is today with your backlog and pipeline? Bob Pragada : Sure. Mike, maybe I'll address both. I'd say, yes, the gross profit and backlog is definitely being positively affected by two elements : one, our service mix; and second, the end market sector mix. And so on the service mix, I mentioned a couple of times, we are really seeing a fundamental shift in our profile with regards to higher-end science-based consulting and advisory services. And that's not only showing up in our results from a burn profile but also in the backlog. The profile of the backlog is right now at a point in time, heavily weighted towards water as well as in advanced facilities, predominantly life sciences. And those two have a higher margin profile as well, so both are having a positive effect on that. With regards to FY 2025, we were looking forward to potentially another strong Q4 backlog performance, booking and backlog performance leading to confidence in our revenue growth in FY 2025. So, definitely some nice tailwinds there. Michael Dudas : That's great, Bob. Thanks, sir. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning everyone. Bob Pragada : Hi, good morning, Andy. Venk Nathamuni : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : So Bob, Venk, or Kevin, can you give us a bit more color into the guidance towards the lower end of your annual EBITDA range you just said? What changed versus last quarter? Obviously, your margin has been very good. So you're seeing delays in backlog burning, which is hurting your revenue. Anything else that you could give us in terms of color? Bob Pragada : Yes. Go ahead, Venk. Venk Nathamuni : Yes. Andy, yes, thanks for the question. So I'd say a few moving parts as it relates to the EBITDA performance. So obviously, from the standpoint of EPS, we came in kind of the midpoint of the range as we guided to. Now as far as the EBITDA is concerned, we did allude to the fact that there were a couple of segments that were weaker than we expected. One was obviously the CMS, the Cytec loss that was announced in the prior quarter and then some of the DVS delays that Bob alluded to in his earnings script. But I would say at a higher level, when you look at the difference between the EBITDA performance and the EPS performance, clearly, we had a little bit of a tax benefit that helped us on the EPS front. And then obviously, as you also know, we reported a pretty significant stock buyback so that reduced the share count as well. So I'd say the difference between the EBITDA and EPS is primarily due to those two items. But what I would also point to is that if you look at the P&PS backlog, we feel pretty good about where our profile of that business is heading towards, both from a revenue growth standpoint as well as the margin standpoint. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then Bob, Venk, or Kevin, you kept the 13.8% plus FY 2025 standalone margin guidance intact for now, but obviously, your People & Places margin has been much higher than expected so far this year. So how do you think about that target at this point? Could there be considerable upside to that target? And then when you think about RemainCo sales, I know you said you expect a pretty good year next year. But any reason why you couldn't expect that sort of 6% to 9% growth for People & Places at least that you've been talking about? Bob Pragada : Yes. So maybe the first one with regards to confidence going into FY 2025, Andy. There was a reason why we put the plus. Clearly, some moving parts right now with regards to the separation. So timing was another element that we want to consider. Performance has been solid. So I would just -- I'd characterize it as some tailwinds that we've got going into FY 2025, and we'll be really clear about that as we move into -- in the next phase, but confidence overall. Andy, remind me again the second half of the question? Andy Kaplowitz : Because you've got a consulting what have you, but how do you think about sort of the visibility toward the core infrastructure growth in 2025? Bob Pragada : Yes. Sorry about that. So yes, good visibility there. During the quarter, we -- strong tailwinds in water and advanced facilities in the areas where there was a little bit of maybe some slight -- not decay, but pause, I'd say, in the UK with regards to transport and the election and then the reprioritization of some shifts in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi. Those haven't gone away. And now with the election in the UK as well as some clarity on programs moving forward in Saudi, those also service some positive tailwinds on a mix standpoint going into FY 2025. Venk Nathamuni : And Andy, if I could, I would say just in terms of just what we see ahead clearly, from a Q4 booking standpoint, there's still some good confidence about the strength of those bookings. But in terms of specifics, we'll obviously provide you fiscal 2025 guidance in the next earnings call. And then we look forward to providing a much more long-term guidance, both in terms of the revenue growth as well as our profitability profile when we have the Investor Day in February. Thank you for your questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. I'm not sure if this one would be something you would say for that Investor Day, but really just trying to think about what's the right framework for profit growth year-over-year in P&PS since Bob, you mentioned that you're going to accelerate the profitable growth. I mean, is the framework here any different than sort of the mid- to upper single-digit revenue growth and then some of this margin mix gets you to low double-digit profit growth? Or is something more like mid-teens possible given that you are accelerating these large awards and some of the mix dynamics? Bob Pragada : Yes. I think it's early, Steve. We're going to go through all of that in some details, but we're really excited about the tailwinds that we see for FY 2025, specifically in all subsectors of the infrastructure market and facilities, but we remain very positive. Steven Fisher : Okay, fair enough. And then just to follow up on the corporate expenses. Just to kind of -- can you just give us an update on how much more clarity you have to the path of hitting the target rate that you have and maybe what the next couple of quarters that you have embedded in there in that trajectory? Kevin Berryman : Well, Look, Steven, I think it's clear that we're going to have a different reporting structure as Venk highlighted once the transaction closes. So the numbers that you will see in the corporate line will start to change, and we're working through all the recurring segments and all that kind of information for the full year reporting. So you may not see exactly the same number going forward, but you will fundamentally on an apples-to-apples basis, that $60 million, we expect will trend down to $50 million over time. And they embedded into a consolidated result for the company and so you may not see it broken out separately. But that's going to help drive towards that 13.8% EBITDA margin that was just asked going forward. So we feel good about it. Some of that cost will have to be targeted after separation because we still have two businesses to run so -- or three, I should say, with PA. And so more to come on that, but we feel confident about the necessary cost reductions that allow us to get to the 13.8% EBITDA margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sabahat Khan : Great, thanks and good morning. You talked a little. You mentioned a bit of a -- the ongoings in the UK a little bit. Can you just maybe talk about just the flow of the projects you're seeing across some of the markets, maybe particularly kind of the U.S. and the UK, obviously, a lot of elections going on? Are there puts and takes globally? Just is that trending in line with what you would have anticipated at the beginning of the year? Just any color there would be great. Bob Pragada : Yes. A couple of comments. Let me start kind of with the U.S. and then work my way around. I'd say in the U.S., the flow of bid activity and pipeline across infrastructure and advanced facility, that hasn't slowed. I'd say the burn rate of some of our U.S. transport work has been a little slower from a burn standpoint, but the level of opportunities have been there. In water, I'd say globally, we have seen some real positive momentum both on bookings as well as burn and that's across all geographies. U.S., Europe to include the UK, Middle East and our Asia Pac and ANZ area. So water has been in that realm as well as advanced facilities really driven by life sciences. So I'd say that just the two areas that we saw as a part of the election in the UK pause was transport. Water kept going in the UK and then the reprioritization in Saudi with regards to some of the event-driven cities oriented work moving more towards the time-based work like the Expo or the airport or infrastructure that's going to be needed with a time element to that in 2026 leading to the Expo and the FIFA World Cup. So these are things that we're continuing to add optimism as we move into Q4 and beyond. Sabahat Khan : Great. And then if you can maybe just follow up on the commentary around the water, I broadly heard that the demand in that space has been growing. Can you maybe just talk about your win rate in that space, any particular areas within the broader water market where you might have been winning an outsized amount of work? And if I could maybe just talk about the progress you've made with AMP8 in terms of any opportunities there that you might have secured. Bob Pragada : Sure. So as far as again what's driving it, clearly, the aging infrastructure is a big piece. The other piece is around combined sewer overflows and what's happening with regards to climate and some of the natural disasters that we're seeing. So I'd say that's accelerating what's going on as well. In the drinking water component, we are seeing an increase in PFAS -- in addressing the PFAS regulations, specifically in the U.S., but also in Germany and in other locations, too. So that's all kind of driving that. Just to quantify it, Sabahat, our pipeline in the water sector is up nearly 2x as it pertains to this time last year. And we are winning a majority of the work that we're going after, hence, the real attention and focus on the growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead. Andy Wittmann : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to get a little clarification on the gross profit in backlog. I guess your total backlog was up 6% year-over-year and your gross profit in backlog was up 5.5%. So that suggests that the overall backlog has a little bit lower margin in it. I guess we've established that the P&PS segment margin is up. So I was wondering what the offset and what segments they are? And if you could talk about the mix in those and what occurred there so we can understand the complexion there a little bit better. I think that would be helpful. Bob Pragada : Andy, maybe just -- I'll let Kevin kind of clarify the nuances within the backlog, and then I'll talk about kind of the profile as it pertains to the various end markets and we can talk about that profile. Kevin Berryman : Yes. Look, so what we're seeing is we've been talking about the growth profile in People & Places top line wise and being a little bit more muted because effectively we're seeing more consulting science-based technology, technical and consulting work that's happening. In the backlog and the book-to-bill, very strong book-to-bill is some other types of projects, which include lower margin work, which will, at the same time, create accelerated good top line growth. So it will be a little bit of a reduction in mix relative to the consulting piece versus our current levels. And at the end of the day, it's going to be quite positive because we'll still see, I think, incremental margin over time in People & Places because we've proven our ability to do that. And we're going to see some accelerated growth as well associated with some of these larger, I'm going to call it, projects that involve program management and extended dollars being spent, which will include a little bit greater percentage of pass-through revenue, which has more limited margin than the high-value consulting work that we do. Bob Pragada : Yes. And Andy, maybe I'll just extend on that last thought that Kevin had. So then if you break that, you cited the consolidated numbers on the 6% and the 5.5% in gross profit. If you then translate that into P&PS, which relates to the last comment that Kevin made, that looks like more like 10% on the top line and 9% on gross profit. So you can kind of see the dynamic leaning towards P&PS is growing at a much higher rate. Andy Wittmann : Got it. Okay. Yes, that actually makes sense. So, that's helpful. I wanted to also just get an update, Bob, just on some of the actions you're taking in preparation for the split. I know you're looking at how your organization works and where the real cost centers are and the benefit centers are. Can you talk about any things that you've actioned to date that we should know about in terms of how you've changed your business model in anticipation of that forthcoming split, things that you're able to do now before you're able to actually effectuate that deal? Bob Pragada : Yes, absolutely. So we really looked at in a consolidated company, what type of corporate needs are going to be needed on more of a homogenous corporate needs are a lot more synchronized across the world. So those movements to global business centers and real streamlining of process protocols and systematic enhancements. Those have been taking place in real time. From a business standpoint, we've already started to transition into optimizing on a lot of our cross-cutting capabilities, program management, digital enablement and other strong sales, market-leading sales functions that will cut across the entirety of the company. So the geographic nuance client-facing entities with cross-cutting capabilities, that structure, it's almost like being in -- with the being the Olympic time right now, it's already in that zone where we're handing off the baton in that section, we're already off and running. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bert Subin : Hi, good morning. Bob Pragada : Hi, Bert. Good morning. Venk Nathamuni : Good morning. Bert Subin : Bob, maybe just to start with you, you had some comments on the advanced facility side. It sounds like life sciences has continued to be really strong, and you mentioned AI data centers, which I feel like is more of like a newer area for you guys in terms of that growing. I didn't hear the semi side. Can you just give some context on sort of what the mix there looks like? I mean, I know Intel reported and said they're taking down their CapEx. So like what the expectation is as we move through into maybe in the 2025 for advanced facilities and how it's performing today? Bob Pragada : Sure. So specifically on semis, Bert, we've been working on this for a while. So clearly, we do, do a lot of work for Intel, and that work is fundamentally on that CapEx program that they highlighted three or four years ago. We had substantially worked our way through that. And so the news that's come out has got a minimal effect on us. The diversification of our services that we perform for Intel, those kind of ongoing sustaining capital work that we do around tool installs and retrofits and layout dependent type work, that will continue. So -- but the good news is that our diversification into memory customers as well as other logic customers that are doing work in the U.S. and in Europe, that's continued, and we'll have, hopefully, some good news to share next quarter on that as well as some of the geographic expansion that's going on in places like India. And so we have some really positive momentum going on, on that front. So overall we're still bullish on the sector, and we'll continue to accelerate growth. Bert Subin : And then in the life sciences\u2026 Bob Pragada : And then on life sciences, yes, that's really going well right now. And it's probably a lot of discussion around GLP-1. But what we're seeing is Alzheimer's and oncology drugs still making a really big play. So the two big players that are in the GLP-1 sector, that is a big part of our work, but the new awards that are coming through, whether they be in the contract manufacturing space or in these other players that are -- have got a really nice pipeline of drugs coming into oncology as well as in Alzheimer's. Those are -- that's really driving that optimism too. Venk Nathamuni : And Bert, if I could, just having most recently come from the semiconductor sector, we do see this as a secular trend in terms of where the manufacturing footprint is and across different realms of semiconductors and logic and memory, as Bob alluded to, and there's also a geographical shift that's happening. So as we look at our portfolio, we have good confidence that we are pretty well diversified. And then just the scope of the opportunities in front of us are still pretty good. Now obviously, any given quarter, it depends on what happens to the market. But I think if you look at it from a secular standpoint, we feel pretty good about our semiconductor footprint. Bert Subin : That's very helpful. Just a clarification there. On the -- Bob, you mentioned the FUJIFILM construction would start to -- the phase 1 will start to ramp down in the first half. Is that expected to have any meaningful impact? Or is the award sort of backfilling that? Bob Pragada : That's on the existing work, Bert. What we announced goes past that. So we're already on site doing phase 1. What I -- so my comment was around phase 1. Phase 2 is now just starting. Bert Subin : Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up, I mean, there's been a lot of questions on sort of the spin-off and sort of the dynamics there, referencing unallocated corporate expense and some of the other things. And I guess, Kevin or Venk, what are some of the dynamics we should be aware of, assuming that the spin-off closes in September, and we're going into the final quarter of the calendar year? What are some things to be aware of just from a perspective on modeling that are going to change? Obviously, not looking for guidance or anything like that, but just some dynamics that maybe are not fully appreciated. Kevin Berryman : Okay. So yes, a couple of things. One, when we do the Q4 results, the full year results, I should say, since we're closing in or before the fiscal year ends, effectively, we will report on an independent Jacobs for the Q4 results and the full year results and report it on a historical basis as such as well. And all of the business that's included in the perimeter, which will be merged into the Amentum business, that will be basically assets held for sale. So you won't see that information. We have provided you guidance for the full year similar to how we've established it for the full year. So assuming that it closes at the end of the year, all of those numbers that we just quoted would effectively be met. But you're going to actually see a lower number in the results just because some of it is now going to be because it's being put into equity directly as assets held for sale and you're going to be seeing the independent Jacobs. So a lot of clarity we'll be providing to get you an understanding of what that looks like, Bert, when we do report Q4 results, but a lot of moving pieces, but kind of that's a very general view of how you're going to be seeing our financials reported in Q4. Venk Nathamuni : Yes. Yes. Sorry, Kevin, just to add to what Kevin said, in addition to what you said about our business is, obviously, Amentum is going to have their Capital Markets Day in August 13. So we'll have some more color in terms of their business. And then as it relates to ours, we'll provide guidance for all of fiscal 2025 in our November earnings call and then we'll talk about not only the revenue and growth as well as the margin profile. And then later on -- during Investor Day, we'll provide much more color about our long-term growth and operating models. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I guess most of my questions have been answered. But Bob, just thinking of Jacobs after the Amentum spin, you're going to have a good balance sheet. Your cash flow generation has been fairly impressive. And I'm just thinking about the growth and the margin that you're seeing in PP&S and PA Consulting. So just sort of wondering what your appetite will be for M&A with Jacobs after the spin-off the attractive dynamics that are out there. And then any help you can give us in sort of how we should think about -- I'm just wondering if free cash flow conversion of the RemainCo is a better story than the market anticipates. Thank you. Bob Pragada : Sure. Maybe I'll take the first one, Jamie, and then Venk can talk about going forward, what free cash flow conversion looks like. But I think initially, we've got a lot of options. And our primary focus in the quarters that followed the separation is execution and performance and really driving that long-term margin growth profile. We like the positioning that we're in, in each of the end markets as well as geographies that we sit in. So it's not like there is an imperative that we need to do M&A in order to catalyze growth. We've got a great growth trajectory organically. And so proving that out, not even proving it out, executing on the plan that we have right now, we've got a lot of confidence in. Past that period, we've got -- you said it yourself, we've got a great balance sheet and we've got a lot of options, and it's a great place to be. So much more to follow on that. On free cash flow, I'll let Venk talk about that. Venk Nathamuni : Yes. And just free cash flow in just a second, but just to reiterate the point about capital allocation, just given what we see ahead of us in terms of the pipeline and the opportunities in front of us, I think from a capital allocation standpoint, we're strong believers in organic growth as the first use of capital. Clearly, from the standpoint of the free cash flow generation and the balance sheet that we have, we do have the ability, number one, we do want to continue to provide shareholders the opportunity to get dividends, but also we do -- we'll be consistent in terms of buying our shares, repurchasing our shares. And then M&A, as Bob mentioned, is also an option. But the next few quarters, almost a singular focus on execution. Now as it comes to free cash flow conversion, Jamie, you rightly pointed out, we've been generating pretty decent free cash flow. We said we'll be at over 100% free cash flow conversion for the remainder of the year. And as you deep dive into the P&PS business, which is a big part of independent Jacobs, you can expect that free cash flow metrics to improve over time. Again, we'll quantify it as we get closer to the date, but we feel pretty good about where we are and where we're going. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sangita Jain : Thank you so much for taking my questions. I guess most of them are answered. So I'm going to limit myself to just one. Are there any discrete deliverables from your side to close the Amentum spin in the second half of September? Or is it just mostly just the paperwork that's taking time? Just wanted to get a sense of that. Kevin Berryman : All of the regulatory approvals on foreign investment and antitrust, all of those kind of things we've already worked through and all has been approved. The only remaining item is the IRS ruling on our private letter ruling that we're looking for, which confirms a view that -- our view that the transaction is tax-free to our shareholders. That's truly what's driving the timing at this point in time. We've been having great discussions with IRS, more to come, but we would expect to get that approval hopefully and over the next month or so. And effectively, that positions for that second half of September close. We've got a lot of things to do with registration for SEC distribution of shares and so on and so forth. But really, the only thing that we were looking for is the IRS ruling, and we feel confident about it. Sangita Jain : Got it. Thanks so much. Bob Pragada : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard : Hi, good morning guys. Bob Pragada : Good morning, Chad. Venk Nathamuni : Good morning. Chad Dillard : So my question has to do with the top line growth rate of the P&PS business. Just trying to understand the trajectory of that as we exit 2024 and then going into 2025. So you're starting kind of like a mid-single-digit rate in 2Q. You've got some pretty solid bookings that you brought in this quarter. And so I guess, like will that be enough for the top line to get back into like that, like 69% target range in 2025? Bob Pragada : Yes. The backlog performance -- the bookings and backlog performance, Chad, has been really, really solid. In fact, the 1.53, we had to go back to see if that was a record in itself. And so we're confident that we're going to be going into 2025 with some really solid growth projections, which we'll be very clear about when we articulate. So that's kind of on the financial and the lagging indicator, the answer is yes. On the leading indicator on the pipeline as well as where we sit in the markets where the pipeline is growing the fastest, water and advanced facilities being highlighted. That also gives us a lot of confidence, too. So short -- a long way of answering your question, the answer is yes. Chad Dillard : Got you. Okay. And then just on that PP&S segment, again, the operating margins. So I guess at least on a year-to-date basis, you're running somewhere close to like 15%. Any reason like that, why that can't continue? And then one more question for you on the 4Q bookings. I think, Bob, you mentioned that you're pretty optimistic about that pipeline for 4Q. Can you just give a little more detail? And do you think you can actually hit like greater than 1x book-to-bill in the fourth quarter? Bob Pragada : Yes. So on the -- on our optimism around the P&PS margins and then how that will translate into go-forward margins for the whole company, I think on Slide 11, we did give some guidance on greater than 14.9%. So it probably highlights the optimism that we have on our current reporting structure with regards to that element. And then on Q4, similar to last quarter, Chad, I wouldn't make those comments unless we had already booked work in the first month of the quarter. So I can't quite announce those right now, but you'll see that when we report out on Q4. Operator : We have time for one more question. And our final question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning everyone. Bob Pragada : Hi, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I wanted to ask People -- hi -- the profit growth that you folks have delivered in People & Places over the past five years has been 8% CAGR over the past over the three years, 11% CAGR. So as you folks think about the organic growth opportunity on a more focused Jacobs, can you just expand on that because the growth has already been really attractive in people in places? And so maybe give us a few threads that you'll expand on the Analyst Day on your expectations to continue to drive that level of growth? Or if you think you can accelerate off of that level of really strong performance that the business has delivered. Bob Pragada : Yes, Jerry, without giving any kind of quantifiable number on where that number is going, I'll say that this our pipeline, where we're positioning the end markets that we sit in today and in the tailwinds with regards to our bookings performance on that gives us a lot of optimism. And so in November and when we report out on the full year for independent Jacobs as well as going into February and along the way in between, we'll put a lot more clarity as well as quantify what that means. But overall, I think hopefully, you're hearing some real optimism in our voices and in our performance on getting to exceeding the performance that we had for the last five years. Jerry Revich : That's a high bar. All right. And can I ask in terms of just the moving pieces that you spoke about Bob, around the UK election, have you started to see now the best result? Have you seen an acceleration in activity levels? Or what's the history lesson on UK elections and the lag to when we start to see a booking reacceleration for your business? Bob Pragada : Yes, I'd say there's been an acceleration in the dialogue, right? And now those translating into those programs that we either paused or in anticipation of being put out to market. I think that's kind of the next phase. So over the course of the next 6 to 12 months, I think we'll see that. Interesting enough, Jerry, the water sector in the UK has not paused at all. And so that continues on. And then with PA, think about this in the UK specifically, as well as globally, PA has about a 50 :50 private sector, public sector mix in their business. The public -- the private sector in PA this quarter grew 11% year-on-year. And the public sector was kind of in this election pause. We see that kind of coming out as well, which gives us optimism not only in the Jacobs business, but in the PA business too, moving into FY 2025. Operator : And we have one more question from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please go ahead. Louie DiPalma : Thanks Bob, Kevin, and Venk. What is your forecast for infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. associated with the IIJA and the CHIPS Act? And is that contributing to your strong backlog? I know you highlighted recent wins with water and also a large multimodal transportation win. But what is your general like expectations over the next few years in terms of the IIJA? Bob Pragada : Sure. Louie, thanks for the question. IIJA, I think these are industry numbers. So 60% appropriated, 30% spent. So yes, there are -- there is work that continues to flow. Right now, I think that the hurdle is 2026. I said it before, that's probably going to continue to go past 2026 as we discussions about a second IIJA, which we'll see where that goes within the congressional floor. But we are -- it is driving that backlog performance and our conversion rate on that as well. I will say this is that on the CHIPS Act -- I'm sorry, one more comment on IIJA. IIJA, the grant money you can see, and that's some of the work that we're seeing that's just in transport, but in water as well. CHIPS Act, those jobs that have received CHIPS Act money, we've been involved with those. Remember, those were pretty much designed and already in the field and then received the funds. Just kind of next wave, we're on the front end of. And so I think that CHIPS Act money will continue to flow and represent a nice tailwind for us. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. And I will turn the conference over to Bob for closing remarks. Bob Pragada : All right. Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining the earnings call. We look forward to providing further updates and visiting with investors and analysts in the months to come. Exciting times ahead and look forward to staying very open and transparent with the market as we move forward. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call.

I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacob's Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada; and CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and highlights from our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Venk will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance, including commentary on end market trends, cash flows, balance sheet data and our FY '25 outlook. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Bert, and I'm delighted to welcome you to Jacobs at such an exciting time. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 business performance. Now moving to Slide 4. We reached a critical milestone on our strategic shift toward a simpler, higher value and higher margin portfolio during the quarter as we closed the separation transaction involving our Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence businesses, on September 27, 2024, culminating with Amentum successfully listing on the NYSE under the ticker, AMTM. This strategic shift has been well received by the market, highlighting confidence in our focused direction and reinforcing our commitment to delivering sustained value and growth for our shareholders. Upon closing the transaction, we received $911 million, which was concurrently used to repay existing debt. Additionally, as a part of the transaction, we received a 7.5% equity ownership in Amentum, which could rise to 8%. At the same time, Jacob\u2019s shareholders became 51% owners in shares of Amentum and their ownership stake could increase up to 55%. I want to take a moment to emphasize how important this transaction is for Jacobs. As a more sharply focused company operating in robust end markets with strong secular growth tailwinds, we believe Jacobs is in an excellent position to create substantial shareholder value. Our simplified structure, global delivery model and ongoing operating efficiencies, positions us nicely to build on a strong end to FY '24. This is a testament to the dedication and relentless efforts of our employees, whose hard work is paving the way forward for two exceptional companies. I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude and congratulations to each of them for their role in this pivotal transformation. Turning to Slide 5. We provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, with CMS and C&I under discontinued operations. So please note, the results we highlight are related only to continuing operations. Focusing in on the quarter. Total gross revenue increased 4% in Q4, with adjusted net revenue rising 4%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.38, and includes a positive $1.20 impact from the mark-to-market of our investment in Amentum, netted against the amortization of intangibles, as well as a $0.19 impact from transaction, restructuring and other related costs. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.37, marking a 28% increase compared to the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 came in at $289 million, which represented a 12% growth versus FY '23. Overall, we are pleased to close out the year with such a positive performance. Looking at the full year. Total gross revenue increased 6% with adjusted net revenue rising 5%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $4.79 and included a positive $0.50 impact, related primarily to the net effect of amortization of acquired intangibles and the mark-to-market of our investment in Amentum, and a negative impact of $1.07 from transaction, restructuring and other related costs, which again, were materially driven by the separation transaction. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $5.28, marking a 16% increase compared to the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA for FY '24 was $1.06 billion, representing a 9% increase versus FY '23. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.35 times as our consolidated backlog increased 23% year-on-year in Q4. Fewer metrics will be watched closely and we are encouraged by the trajectory we're delivering on, with an extremely strong 1.67 times book-to-bill for the fourth quarter. When we analyze our backlog, we are seeing this trend across gross revenue and backlog as well as gross profit and backlog, which is a good indicator as we think about our growth for FY '25 and beyond. Turning to Slide 6, and building on my backlog and book-to-bill commentary. I'm excited to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins across the business and across geographies, a testament to our market positioning, deep domain expertise, and long-term trusted client relationships. As we move forward as a simpler and more focused company, we will be providing commentary on revenue across three key end markets, water and environmental, life sciences and advanced manufacturing and critical infrastructure. These end markets roll up to infrastructure and advanced facilities, which is comprised of our historic P&PS business and the retained portion of Divergent Solutions. PA Consulting remains in its own segment and is unchanged. On Slide 14, in the appendix, we provide a graphic that depicts our new structure and end-market focus. Moving on to how our end markets are performing. Water and Environmental is demonstrating impressive growth. Water conveyance, water infrastructure, wastewater, potable reuse and efficient asset management are just some of the key drivers of our client spend. And we have been successful servicing demand across these categories with double-digit growth in Q4. Notably, during Q4, we delivered several key wins, including our appointment by the Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment to provide progressive design build services for the Donald C. Tillman Advanced Water Equalization basins, a critical part of LA's long-term plans to increase recycled water production by 2035. Significantly, this is one of the single largest bookings in the Water and Environmental end market in our company's history. In Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, we continue to see robust demand from Life Sciences clients, boosted by GLP-1 investment, and we expect this trend to continue in FY '25. In Semiconductors, we are diversifying our customer base and expanding our global reach. One example is our recent design win for a new test and assembly facility with CG Semi in India. The facility will manufacture advanced and legacy packages for industries such as automotive, consumer, industrial and 5G communications, and facilitate our strategic positioning in India where electronics manufacturing spend is expected to grow meaningfully. Global investment spending across Life Sciences, Semis and Data Centers is creating a robust backdrop for Jacobs in FY '25 and beyond. Moving on to Critical Infrastructure. During the quarter, we secured a technical project manager role with the Department of Energy Security & Net Zero in the UK. A great example of how we are leveraging our differentiated offering in energy security and transition that demonstrates the power of our partnership and greater collaboration with PA Consulting. We will provide project management and advisory services along with associated strategic support to the Hydrogen and Industrial Carbon Capture program that includes consulting, end-to-end innovation, design and analytics. We are also seeing continued traction in the Middle East as Saudi Vision 2030 significantly increases the number of opportunities across critical infrastructure. Notably, during Q4, we announced a new award to lead advisory, design and engineering for the King Salman International Airport, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Our outlook for near and long-term expansion in the region remains intact and we are seeing signals of strong demand for infrastructure projects across the globe in the early days of FY '25. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to grow the business and deliver superior execution to meet our clients' expectations. We're excited for the future as a more focused company and look forward to presenting our strategic vision for growth over the coming years at our Investor Day, in Miami, on February 18. Now, I'll turn the call over to Venk to review our financial results in further detail. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, Bob, and good day, everyone. We are pleased with our Q4 performance, which contributed to a strong year. Let me now begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slides 7 and 8. Starting on Slide 7, we show quarterly results, and I'll provide additional context and detail around our performance from continuing operations. As Bob noted, CMS and C&I have been excluded from our results as those businesses are listed under discontinued operations. We provide a reconciliation on Page 24 in the appendix, that will allow you to compare results for the enterprise, including the businesses that were separated in the fourth quarter. Notably, I want to highlight, that in total, we did outpace the $7.95 adjusted EPS midpoint for fiscal '24 that we guided to with Q3 results. However, from here forth, we will only be discussing continuing operations. Fourth quarter gross revenue grew 4% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes the impact of pass-through revenue, also grew 4%. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $289 million, growing 12% year-over-year to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.6%, which is an increase of approximately 100 basis points from last year. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.37, marking a 28% increase compared to the previous year. Please note that during the quarter, GAAP EPS benefited from a $187 million pre-tax gain associated with the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in Amentum with no benefit to adjusted EPS. Additionally, PA Consulting contributed $0.10 of EPS dilution to GAAP EPS from periodic fair value change impacts on our redeemable non-controlling interest balances, and this impact was added back to adjusted EPS in Q4. We provide a walk-through of our adjusted EPS calculation for continuing operations on Slide 23. Finally, consolidated backlog was up almost 23% year-over-year to $21.8 billion. The trailing 12-month revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.35 times, with our gross profit and backlog increasing 12% year-over-year. As Bob noted earlier, this is an encouraging data point as we look ahead to fiscal '25. The Q4 book-to-bill of 1.67 times, though partly a function of higher pass-through revenue, is still very positive and helped us end the year on a high note. Moving on to Slide 8, I'll recap fiscal '24 results. Fiscal '24 total gross revenue increased 6% year-over-year, with adjusted net revenue rising 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% as a function of higher revenue and just over 40 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 16% year-on-year. We're pleased to end fiscal '24 in a strong position with solid organic revenue growth, double-digit EPS growth and a backlog that sets us up for continued growth in fiscal '25 and beyond. Regarding the performance of our end markets in the quarter, let's now turn to Slide 9. As Bob noted earlier, we're reporting our business as Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, and PA Consulting, and we will discuss revenue trends in our three key end markets. This should provide helpful context to supplement our overall results. We'll focus on adjusted net revenue in our discussion as we believe this is a better indicator of business trends as it excludes pass-through revenues. However, we do list gross revenue growth across each end market for your reference. In Water and Environmental, growth was solid, with adjusted net revenue increasing 13% versus the same quarter last year. Water and Environmental demand has been strong and we expect that to continue in fiscal '25 based on our current backlog and pipeline. Encouragingly, demand is being driven by multiple geographies, with North America, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, all growing double digits in the quarter. Our Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing end market revenue grew 3% in Q4, with strength partially offset by an unfavorable revenue adjustment related to an EV battery manufacturer customer bankruptcy in Europe. Our outlook for this end market is for Life Sciences to be the primary driver of revenue growth in fiscal '25 as capital investment from our Life Sciences customers remains robust. We're also seeing our customer base broaden in Semis and the AI data center opportunity is expanding. As we look into fiscal '25 and beyond, we anticipate top-line growth in this end market, not only from rising industry investment, but also differentiation through our cross-cutting Water and Energy capabilities. In Critical Infrastructure, adjusted net revenue increased 1%, with North America showing steady growth, while certain international markets have lagged. We expect to see improvement across critical infrastructure in fiscal '25, with our backlog and pipeline underpinning a strong recovery as transportation project demand is rising. Putting this all together, we have line of sight to maintaining strong revenue growth in Water and Environmental and increasing our growth rates in Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, as well as Critical Infrastructure end markets in the coming year relative to Q4. Now moving on to Slide 10, I will provide a quick overview of our segment financials. We saw strong trends in Q4 for Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities operating profit, which increased 12% year-over-year in total and 12% on a constant currency basis. In fiscal '24, operating profit increased 9% year-over-year and 9% on a constant currency basis. Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities results were aided by both revenue growth and margin expansion. Moving on to PA Consulting, results reflect modest top-line growth, but good execution on the bottom-line. Q4 operating profit increased 4% year-over-year and fiscal '24 operating profit increased 1%. Both were slightly negative on a constant currency basis. However, we are encouraged by recent bookings and anticipate that growth will trend higher in fiscal '25. Moving on to Slide 11, we provide an overview of cash generation and balance sheet data. For fiscal '24, free cash flow from continuing operations was strong at $718 million and enabled us to repurchase $403 million in shares and pay $143 million in cash dividends. We also paid down debt and ended the year with roughly $1.1 billion in net debt, which represented a net leverage ratio of 1.0 times on LTM adjusted EBITDA. This is at the low end of our 1.0 times to 1.5 times target. Our balance sheet strength will enable continued investment in the business as well as returns to shareholders through share repurchases and long-term dividend growth. We currently have $472 million in remaining authorization under our repurchase program, and recently declared a dividend of $0.29, a 12% increase year-over-year. And finally, please turn to Slide 12 for our fiscal '25 outlook. We expect adjusted net revenue to increase mid to high-single digits year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 13.8% to 14%, adjusted EPS to range from $5.80 to $6.20, and reported free cash flow conversion to be more than 100%. We will have cash outflows related to restructuring of $75 million to $95 million in fiscal 2025, with that impact declining through fiscal '25. The midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS would indicate about 14% growth year-over-year, and the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA would indicate approximately 15% growth year-over-year, highlighting our strong outlook for business performance this year. We provide relevant assumptions on the right side of the page to help you with your modeling. One item to be mindful of is our projected tax rate of approximately 26%. Our fiscal '25 tax rate is expected to be several points higher than in fiscal '24 and fiscal '23, and is a function of multiple discrete tax benefits in those historical periods that are not expected to recur. Despite the higher tax rate, we will still anticipate strong adjusted EPS growth in fiscal '25. I'd note, from a trend perspective, we expect to start fiscal '25 with Q1 revenue adjusted EBITDA margin and earnings below Q4 of fiscal '24, reflecting typical seasonality. However, as we progress through fiscal '25, we expect to see sequential growth in our financial results through Q4. Overall, we're excited about the future of Jacobs and are entering fiscal '25 in a strong position financially, with positive underlying momentum in the business. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Venk. In closing, as a more focused Enterprise, we are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the momentum, in the Water and Environmental, Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, and Critical Infrastructure end markets. And we remain confident in our ability to grow market share and fulfill the needs of our clients across our business, over time. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on a very active and successful spin and the recap. Bob Pragada : Thanks, Mike. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, Mike. Michael Dudas : So impressive, you standalone backlog growth, and heading into 2025. Maybe you can talk about the pipeline you see maybe amongst the three major end markets, growth in pipeline year-over-year, and how much of your 2025 net revenues and EBITDA do you currently have kind of in backlog or in sight, and what's required to achieve your midpoint year targets? Bob Pragada : Sure. So Michael, on the first question, pipeline growth has been really, really strong. If you look at the kind of the big verticals, Water and Environmental up double-digits on a pipeline basis. Advanced Facilities really driven by Life Sciences, we're seeing double-digit growth in that pipeline. And in Critical Infrastructure, which is really driven by transportation. We're seeing a nice comeback on the pipeline, specifically in our European to include the UK and Australia and New Zealand end markets. Middle East continues to grow too. So if you kind of aggregate those, the pipeline looks really, really strong. On the second, don't want to, go too far on the actual number, but I'd say, historically, we would see a certain percentage of -- our next fiscal year revenue in backlog. That percentage is a higher percentage this year. Now, on a 1.67 times book-to-bill, that's not all in one year, that's multiyear booking, but the kind of contracted component for FY '25 is a very strong number. Michael Dudas : That's helpful. My follow-up is, Bob, maybe you can share views from your client base and how Jacobs positioning relative to the election and some of the machinations we're hearing out of the federal government, how that could translate to your FAGUS (ph) business in the U.S.? Bob Pragada : Sure. So, maybe two parts to that question. We kind of see it overall as a net neutral. If we -- if you look at those end markets that were -- now as the new Jacobs honed in on, these are jobs that were either tied to some level of state and local element, which are continuing, kind of think Water and Environmental. And the transportation jobs that we're in the middle of, at a national level in the U.S., have got long tails on them, and we still see the pipeline really strong. So infrastructure wise, we're feeling it's a net neutral. Just as a note, lately been seeing some softness within the federal market. In now our portfolio, about 10% of our business is in that federal market. However, it's -- of that 10%, a majority of that is in DoD and DoD infrastructure, specifically, which we see that pipeline continuing on. Advanced Facilities, continued strong. That industrial reshoring, onshoring, as well as, what's happening in the world of science and technology, specifically in the U.S., we're feeling confident about it. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning, and I'll add my congratulations on the completion of the deals. And thanks for all the color on the growth rates within the segments. It's a pretty wide range of growth rates between Water versus the Life Sciences versus the Critical Infrastructure, 1,000 basis points or more, it seems like. And I know you said you expect the slower ones to accelerate. Can you just maybe frame for us, kind of how big a gap you're expecting or how much you can close that gap between them? And just, kind of curious, was there that big a gap or a drag from that EV cancellation in the quarter? And was there any sort of weather impact as one of your peers cited? Thanks. Bob Pragada : Yeah. So let me answer the last part, Steve, first, and just kind of breaking down those three main areas. And your next question -- your first question. It was a gap, that EV cancellation. So on the AF or the Advanced Facilities component, we do see closing that gap. It would have been closed already, but the future looks very bright there, and represented by our backlog. Water and Environmental, we see continued growth. And on transportation, specifically Critical Infrastructure, what we're seeing in our pipeline as well as Q1. So to be reporting wins in transportation specifically, outside the U.S., is really that gap was outside the U.S. That's already, we've already seen that in real time. Certainty in the budget in the UK is giving us confidence there as well as some really strong wins that we've had in Australia and New Zealand coming out. So we don't really see that gap being a big one. Steven Fisher : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. How should we think about the progress now on some of the corporate costs that you have embedded in the segment reporting in '25 versus '24? And relative to the restructuring costs, it sounds like, that will kind of continue on through the year. Do you think fourth quarter will still have some of that in there, or it will be done by the time fourth quarter starts? Thank you. Bob Pragada : Go, Venk. Venk Nathamuni : Yeah. Thank you, Steve. So a couple of questions. So one on the, the overall cost structure. As you can tell, we made a pretty significant progress in fiscal '24 in terms of our operating margin and EBITDA margin expansion. And I would say there's still room there in terms of improving the margins over time, and that's why we guided to 100 basis point increase year-on-year for fiscal '25. And if you look at the various parts of it, clearly, from the standpoint of operational efficiency, we still have room there. We've had a -- we'll have a full year of what you call annualization of operating efficiencies, because lot of it happened, towards the second half of fiscal '24. You'll see a lot of that manifest in its entirety in fiscal '25. And then, overall, cost controls is something that we are focused on. And last but not least, we are continuing to improve our mix of our business as well as how we implement these projects from a global connectivity standpoint. So, multiple facets to this margin story over time. And then your second question about restructuring. So as you pointed out, we did have restructuring in fiscal '24. Clearly, as you know, we have a commitment to Amentum to continue to do our transition services, that will last maybe another two, three quarters. So, we should see a pretty dramatic decline in our restructuring, going from fiscal '24 to fiscal '25, and we've quantified it in the range of $75 million to $95 million. Obviously, we'll try to do our best to make sure that marks the end of our restructuring in a meaningful way. Yeah. And then, the other part of the restructuring is obviously having, some ownership of liability with the PA Consulting business as well. Steven Fisher : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Wittmann : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I guess I wanted to build on an earlier question, again, and just kind of talk about the backlog as it relates to the outlook. I mean, your backlog is up 22.5% year-over-year, which is great. But your revenue guidance is up, mid to high-single digits. That seems like a really wide gap. And so I heard some of the comments about, some longer projects. But is there stuff in the backlog that's not moving? Is some of the backlog, these bigger chunkier bookings like you're doing for maybe Advanced Technology and Life Sciences, you're doing construction management scope, is that kind of -- does that flow through as lower margin? There's a lot going on there, but I think the discrepancy between the backlog growth and the revenue guidance is worth digging into a little bit deeper. So if you could comment on that, I think would be helpful. Thank you. Bob Pragada : Sure. And thanks, Andy. So a couple of things. Yeah. It is the most significant book-to-bill that we've had, probably in the history of the company, and really, really proud of that. The Life Sciences and the Water bookings that we've had are large, and they're multiyear. And so, they're not any -- and they're not -- they're not degrading (ph) to margins. These are at and in certain cases above our kind of corporate margins that we've demonstrated here in the last few quarters. So it's the multi-year component of that, that is driving the revenue guidance. And we also gave, room on the mid to high-single digits to kind of compensate for the bell shaped curve on a project lifecycle too. So, like we -- we're feeling really good. These are some of the largest bookings that we've had, and I think I mentioned in the script, in the history of the company, which kind of goes through the testament of our market positioning right now. Andrew Wittmann : Got it. It's kind of a question I want to ask. Also, I mean, the restructuring, obviously, this was kind of expected, you've got the Amentum transition services and all the first year things that go with the spin off. But Bob, as you look at '26, do you feel like '26 is the year that we get pretty clean results? It sounds like even at the end of this year, it's pretty clean. So -- but I thought maybe I'd have you comment on '26 as -- kind of similar. Bob Pragada : No, absolutely. Andrew Wittmann : I think it's an important question. Bob Pragada : It's a very important question, and thanks for asking it. I'd say second half, you're going to see a significant decay. And '26, short answer, yes. Yes, being clean, yeah. Andrew Wittmann : Yeah. Got it. Thanks, guys. That's all I have for today. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you. Bob Pragada : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sabahat Khan : Hey. Great. Thanks, and good morning. Just about to your earlier comment around some of the buffer that you've built into the 5%, or sorry, call it, the mid to high-single digit organic growth rate to allow for some of these longer life projects. This seems to be in line with the guidance you provided pre-election. I guess, would you say that range also builds in some buffer for maybe administration change or just kind of seeing how things evolve in early part of the year? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about the low end versus the high end given some of the moving pieces, particularly on the U.S. side? Thanks. Bob Pragada : Yeah, Saba. My answer was really -- was based on our clients activity. And going back to, any type of potential delays that happened as a result of the election, those would -- we don't feel like those would pertain to these jobs that are going forward at the state and local level, supporting some pretty large events that are happening in Los Angeles and in other venues around the world, specifically on the Water and Transportation side. And then, on the Advanced Facility side, these are commitments that our clients have made to the end markets on some pretty, pretty critical therapies that the world needs. So these are tied to global trends that are probably a little segregated from what might happen with regards to churn in the Beltway. So those were two, separate. Venk Nathamuni : And Saba, if I could add, the range that we've provided, from our guidance perspective, we try to guide for what we think is the most likely outcome. And obviously, as Bob alluded to, it depends on the profile of the customer burn and so forth. And so that's what's imputed in our guidance. And that's why we provided the range to -- in the mid to high-single digits for revenue growth. Sabahat Khan : All right. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the markets outside of the U.S., as we look at maybe the UK, the Middle East. It looks like some changing priority in the Middle East, but it sounds like from your commentary that's going well. Can you maybe just talk about kind of the -- kind of your focus on those regions? What drives you kind of to continue to be exposed there? It looks like there's a lot of dollars there, particularly in the Middle East, but a bit of an evolution in how they're going about their development for the next few years? And also if you can just comment on, post the recent election in the UK, how you see the spending priorities reflected in the recent infrastructure or sort of the recent budget, and how they align with what you're doing in that market? Just want to get a bit more perspective on those two larger regions for you outside of the U.S. Thanks. Bob Pragada : Sure. So, let me kind of breakdown the question here. On the two geographies, is -- and actually -- look this -- this comment is going to apply to every single one of our geographies. We are in the locales that we're in to service those local clients. And so, just on that element, with regards to the UK and the Middle East, those are strong markets. And yes, there's -- there are economic ebbs and flows in those markets. But our client base, especially now with our kind of our focus portfolio, these are long-term kind of trends. So any kind of near-term oscillations, if you look at it on the long-term, they're solid. And in the UK, in the Middle East, we're seeing some nice tailwinds that they're coming back and might not be as strong as 10 years ago or before. But compared to recent times, we're seeing some of that come through. How do we gauge that? We gauge that through our pipeline, and we're seeing our pipeline grow. And so, those -- kind of on that. Water in the UK never slowed down. So really the upside that we're talking about is more honed in on transportation as well as some of our Advanced Facilities world. But the key is that us staying in those geographies is really more about our talent, and that talent ends up addressing both the local market, but also there's some really, really key talent that we have in UK, Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, that are being deployed around the world. So that talent piece is really, really key in how we think about our global model. On the elections, we -- again, we don't think that that is going to affect, what we're talking about as far as the strength in the end markets. And so, we stand behind the numbers we put out. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead. Natalia Bach : Hi. Good morning. This is Natalia Bach on behalf of Andy Kaplowitz. Bob Pragada : Hi. Good morning. Natalia Bach : Good morning. First question I'd like to ask, in PA Consulting, exit margins reflect continued improvement. As we think about fiscal year '25, do you expect that trend to continue? And then can you provide more color on your visibility towards revenue growth expectations for the segment? You have relatively easier comps and backlog seems to be picking up. Any detail would be helpful. Bob Pragada : Sure. Why don't I answer the first one and then Venk will address kind of the confidence in revenue growth coming in the year. As far as the margins go, we continue to see -- during -- even during, the run-up to the election in the UK as well as other areas that PA has a presence, the margins have stayed true and the team has done a really good job at continuing to focus in on higher value as well as strength of the offering that they have for their clients. So we don't -- we see that margin profile continuing, moving forward. Venk, you want to talk about the revenue growth? Venk Nathamuni : Yeah, absolutely. So in terms of just revenue growth for the PA Consulting business, we -- we've had good insight into their pipeline, especially over the last several quarters. And we're feeling pretty good about the inflection point in PA's business in terms of the growth really coming together in fiscal '25. Now, when we provided the high level guidance for our overall revenue growth of mid to high-single digits, that certainly imputes PA Consulting also, providing that growth acceleration from the prior year. So, all of that is taken into account as we give our overall guidance for all of, PA Consulting plus Jacobs, and we feel that there is certainly an inflection point in fiscal '25 with regards to the growth from PA Consulting. Bob Pragada : And their PA -- then their -- and their backlog grew at the same rate as ours did. Venk Nathamuni : That's right. Yeah. Natalia Bach : Got it. Helpful. And then, just one more follow-up question for me. It appears the near-term -- focus with respect to capital deployment seems to be toward debt paydown and share repurchases. But as you now sit with your new portfolio, are there any areas in your portfolio where potential M&A could fill the gap? Venk Nathamuni : Yeah. No, great question. So first of all, and I'd like to reiterate that, as I mentioned in the script, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders in form of buybacks and dividends, and we return almost 60% of free cash flow in fiscal '24. So, we're continuing to commit to a significant portion of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders. On top of it, as you pointed out, we have been paying down debt. We did get about $911 million in Amentum proceeds on day one of the transaction, which we then used to pay down debt. And we do still have a 7.5% to 8% retained stake that we hope to monetize in the first half of calendar '25. And then beyond that, as I look at the capital allocation priorities for us, we -- there's a lot of excitement about organic growth opportunities in the business, so number one priority will continue to be investing in the organic growth of the business. Number two, as I said before, is returning, cash to shareholders in form of both dividends and buybacks, and we're committed to that. And then, finally, from an M&A perspective, certainly, that is an accelerant for us in the long term. We'll talk a lot more about it during Investor Day, but suffice it to say that we have lots of optionality with the balance sheet position that we have, the significant free cash flow that we generate, and our ability to return that to shareholders as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sangita Jain : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So if I could just take the growth outlook to a higher level, can you help us understand if you're thinking higher growth, internationally versus domestic, given the elections? I know we've discussed elections a few times already on this call. Bob Pragada : No, Sangita. That's the way it came across if that wasn't the case. We had some flattening growth outside the U.S. in our infrastructure end markets. We're talking about that inflecting forward. Within the U.S., those numbers have been positive -- for the last fiscal year. Sangita Jain : And how about your outlook for the upcoming year? Do you think the U.S. will still grow faster or how do you see it? Bob Pragada : We do. And we're seeing that in our pipeline right now growing as well as our book-to-bill and the double-digit growth that we've had in backlog. Sangita Jain : Okay. Then if I can follow-up on your talent pool, let's just say, we don't really know the policy priorities of the new administration yet, etc., but let's just say public spending in the U.S. does slow down, how fungible is your talent pool should you have to reallocate resources? Bob Pragada : Yeah. I don't know if I would use the word fungible, but they're very deployable, and work on -- work all over the world, both in the U.S., outside the U.S., and from outside the U.S., in. It's really important to understand, the mix of our people in the U.S. and outside the U.S. does not map to our U.S. versus non-U.S. revenue stream. And so that is a very balanced look on how we utilize our people around the world. Sangita Jain : Got it. Appreciate that. Thank you. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you. Operator : Your next\u2026 Bob Pragada : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Chad Dillard : Hey. Good morning, guys. Bob Pragada : Yeah. Good morning, Chad. Chad Dillard : So my question is on the algorithm for adjusted operating margins for the Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities business. So, I guess, like maybe if you could break it out in two ways. So first of all, I'm just trying to figure out, the three sub segments, like your -- it sounds like the Water business is growing faster, Life Sciences business is growing faster. To what extent is that accretive to margins? And then I guess, on the second part, you guys talked about, cost savings, like how do we think about like the year-on-year boost in margins from that? Venk Nathamuni : Yeah, Chad, thanks for those questions. So, I'd say the, look, first on the end markets, the way we model our business is to obviously go after the best opportunities that we have across those different end markets and continue to focus on top-line growth, but also in this way that optimizes margin so that it meets our corporate average, right? So, in any given quarter, any given in the first half or second half of the year, we can certainly have ups and downs with regards to the margin profiles. But what we try to optimize for is the good balance between, continued revenue growth as well as -- gross margins and operating margins improving over time. And that's what we've quantified in terms of our expectation for fiscal '25. So, I wouldn't say one business is any different from another from the standpoint of the optimization. But certainly, we want to continue to focus on profitable revenue growth such that both our revenue as well as the margins expand over time. So that's more work. And then going to your second question about cost savings, as I alluded to in response to a previous question, we have made significant strides in terms of improving the operating efficiency, but you had just six months of that take effect in fiscal '24. So we'll have the annualization of operating efficiencies take full effect in fiscal '25, and that's part of the margin expansion story for us. But it's not just that. I mean, in addition to it, as I mentioned before, we are optimizing our go-to-market, we're optimizing, our global connectivity, and so forth. So we do see a multi-year trend in terms of, focusing on improving our profitability over time, not just on the cost side, but certainly from a business mix standpoint as well as from an efficiency standpoint. Chad Dillard : Great. That's helpful. And then the second question has to do with your revenue guidance for the full year, that mid to high-single digits. So, I guess to get to that higher end of that range, like what needs to go right, either from like a geographic standpoint or from, like, in market standpoint, like, what would you need to see there? Bob Pragada : It would be if the -- if we see an acceleration in the jobs we're on. That heavy, heavy focus now from the backlog growth coming from our Water as well as Life Sciences sector is, those could be accelerated and we could find ourselves, on the higher end of that range. So, we're watching that very closely. Chad Dillard : Great. Thanks all. Bob Pragada : Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Hi, yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. Can I ask for the legacy People and Places business? You folks have delivered steady margin expansion, you're now running scope margins in the low-teens. As you think about the margin upside that you discussed over the course of this call, what do you think is a reasonable target or a bogey where you can drive that business over time? Are we talking about tens of basis points improvements? Or are the initiatives that you spoke about earlier, can we see a more significant margin upside in that line of business? Venk Nathamuni : Yeah, Jerry. Thank you for the question. And yes, certainly, we feel good about the margin expansion for fiscal '25 that I alluded to both in the prepared remarks as well as in response to a couple of questions. And as we look-ahead beyond fiscal '25, certainly, we'll provide you a lot more clarity when it comes to Investor Day, not just in terms of our revenue growth and, end market mix as well, but also in terms of capital allocation and margin expansion story. So, suffice it to say that we do feel good about our margin expansion in fiscal '25, and beyond that, we'll cover in more detail. Jerry Revich : Okay. And let me ask you, I know it's early -- very early post Amentum, but obviously, the business leaders have been focused on the new Jacobs for, quite some time now, over a year. Can you just talk about, at the operating level, what kind of difference in performance that you're seeing or any developments that are notable as a result of the change in focus or the more narrowed change in focus, so far? Bob Pragada : Yeah. Jerry, it's a great question. I'd say that the operating model is in full effect right now. You're right, we got out ahead of that during the course of the year. I think the biggest change has been getting back to where we came from where we were externally focused on our clients' business. And that has really come to the core of how we think about the world. And instead of being internally focused on, some of the transactions that we were doing, whether they'd be over the course of the last couple of years or leading up to this quarter. So that's been the real change, understanding our clients' business and we're seeing it in our sales performance in Q3 and Q4 of last year. So, we're excited because those actions and those behaviors are turning into a 22% backlog growth at a 1.67 times book-to-bill. And that's kind of -- the proof is in the numbers. So, we're excited. Jerry Revich : Thank you. Bob Pragada : Thank you. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you. Operator : And I will now turn the conference back over to Bob Pragada for closing remarks. Bob Pragada : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Look forward to providing further updates and visiting with investors and analysts in the coming weeks and months. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Jacobs Solutions' Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call and webcast. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to Bert Subin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Bert, you may begin. Bert Subin : Thank you, Krista, and good morning, everyone. Our earnings announcement and 10-Q were filed this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference during the call. I would like to refer you to Slide 2 of the presentation material for information about our forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and operating metrics. Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. Speaking on today's call will be Jacobs' Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada; CFO, Venk Nathamuni. Bob will begin by providing an overview of recent activities and highlights from our first quarter results. Venk will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance, including commentary on end-market trends, cash flows and balance sheet data. Finally, Bob will provide closing remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chair and CEO, Bob Pragada. Bob Pragada : Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2025 business performance. Starting on Slide 4. I want to highlight that we are excited to be hosting our 2025 Investor Day on February 18 in Miami. Our simplified structure global delivery model and end-to-end expertise position us extremely well to build on a great start to FY '25. We see a bright future ahead as we are creating value for our shareholders over the long term. And at our Investor Day, we plan to lay out our vision for Jacobs' next exciting chapter. We look forward to providing you with more details in just two weeks. Turning to Slide 5. Total gross revenue increased over 4% in Q1 with adjusted net revenue rising over 5%. GAAP EPS was negative $0.10 and includes a negative $1.16 impact from the mark-to-market loss in our investment in Amentum. Excluding this and other items, Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.33, an 8% decrease compared to the previous year. The year-on-year decline in adjusted EPS was a result of a favorable tax item last year that resulted in a $0.49 per share benefit in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 was $282 million, which represented a 24% year-on-year increase. We are pleased with the strong underlying business performance, and we are seeing very good traction on adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.3x as our consolidated backlog increased 19% year-over-year in Q1. We are encouraged by the trajectory we're delivering on, following two extremely strong quarters for new awards in the second half of 2024. Gross profit in backlog increased 12% year-over-year in the first quarter, reflecting back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth. Turning to Slide 6. I'm excited to report that during the quarter, we continued to deliver substantial wins across the business and across geographies, a testament for our market positioning, deep domain expertise and long-term trusted client relationships. We saw solid revenue growth year-over-year, mainly in our Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities segment. We are demonstrating impressive revenue growth globally in Water and Environmental with all major geographies showing strength in Q1. Notably, during Q1, we were selected to operate, maintain and provide capital projects program support for the water treatment system managed by JXN Water. This 10-year contract will continue to improve water service and water equity and has already provided 180,000 residents in and around Jackson, Mississippi with more reliable drinking water. In Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing, we continue to deliver strong results in Life Sciences with double-digit net revenue growth in Q1. Our backlog in Life Sciences has been rising over the last 12 months, giving us a good line of sight over the coming quarters. Further, market activity remains very robust with our involvement spanning key areas such as GLP-1, monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and cutting-edge R&D programs for leading biopharmaceutical companies. Turning to Critical Infrastructure. During the quarter, we achieved significant milestones on two transformative projects. First, we were selected as part of the preferred alliance for the landmark River Torrens to Darlington project in South Australia. This $15.4 billion initiative by the South Australian government will deliver a 10.5-kilometer nonstop motorway completing the 78-kilometer north-south corridor. The TDD project is poised to drive economic growth and development across Adelaide and South Australia. Additionally, we've been chosen by Ireland's National Transport Authority to deliver the BusConnects Dublin program. This ambitious 10-year initiative will enhance public transit by developing 230 kilometers of bus priority corridors and 200 kilometers of cycling and pedestrian paths. The project not only promotes sustainable growth and climate resilience, but also strengthens connectivity in and around Dublin. We are encouraged by the increased demand for large-scale international projects and critical infrastructure to complement the momentum we've been seeing in the U.S. In summary, we are pleased with our continued progress this quarter as we execute on our strategic priorities to deliver sustainable and profitable growth. We're excited for the future and look forward to presenting our strategic vision for Jacobs over the coming years at our upcoming Investor Day. Now I'll turn the call over to Venk to review our financial results in further detail. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you, Bob. Let me begin by summarizing a few of the financial highlights on Slide 7 and I'll then provide additional context and detail around our strong quarterly performance. First quarter gross revenue grew 4% year-over-year and adjusted net revenue, which excludes the impact of pass-through revenue, grew by 5% year-over-year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $282 million, growing 24% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin during Q1 came in strong at 13.5%, which is an increase of approximately 200 basis points year-over-year. First quarter adjusted EPS was $1.33, an 8% decrease versus the previous year, primarily due to an unfavorable tax comparison. As Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, last year, we benefited from a discrete tax item that did not recur in 2025. Please also note, GAAP EPS was impacted by a $145 million unrealized pretax loss associated with the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in Amentum, which had no impact on adjusted EPS. Finally, consolidated backlog was up approximately 19% year-over-year and remains near record levels at $21.8 billion. Q1 book-to-bill of 1.0x was solid. Our trailing 12-month revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3x with gross profit and backlog increasing 12% year-over-year during Q1, highlighting our strong trailing 12-month sales performance. Going forward, we will focus our attention on trailing 12-month performance in our book-to-bill ratios as we believe this is a better indicator of future growth. Regarding our performance by end market, in infrastructure and Advanced Facilities, let's turn to Slide 8. Demand for our Water and Environmental Services remains strong across all major geographies, with adjusted net revenue increasing 11% compared to the same quarter last year. This momentum is expected to continue beyond fiscal '25 and is supported by our robust backlog and pipeline. We grew adjusted net revenue in our Life Sciences and Advanced Manufacturing end market by over 1% in Q1 as Life Sciences strength was largely offset by softness in Advanced Manufacturing. We expect Life Sciences growth to remain robust for the foreseeable future as we continue to ramp on new projects. Additionally, we've seen a significant uptick in our Life Sciences pipeline. On the Advanced Manufacturing side, we expect growth to improve in the second half of the year as new projects start to ramp. This combination leads us to forecast similar growth in Q2 relative to Q1, followed by a pickup in the second half of the year. In Critical Infrastructure, adjusted net revenue increased 5% year-over-year with North America outpacing total growth for the end market. We're pleased with the sequential improvement in Critical Infrastructure growth and our backlog and pipeline, particularly in transportation, underpin an encouraging outlook. Moving on to Slide 9, I will provide a quick overview of our segment financials. In Q1, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities operating profit increased by 26% in total and 25% on a constant currency basis versus last year. PA Consulting results reflect roughly flat revenue performance year-on-year, but very good execution on the bottom line. Q1 operating profit increased 22.6% year-over-year and 19.6% on a constant currency basis. We remain encouraged by recent bookings and anticipate revenue growth for PA Consulting will improve in fiscal '25 as the year progresses. Moving on to Slide 10, we provide an overview of cash generation and balance sheet data. For Q1, free cash flow was healthy at $97 million, and we repurchased $202 million in shares, a sequential increase of $145 million. This combination resulted in our net leverage ratio remaining relatively flat at 1.1x on an LTM-adjusted EBITDA basis as of Q1. I'd note this remains below the midpoint of our 1.0 to 1.5x net leverage target. As we look ahead, we expect free cash flow for the full year to be similar to our previous expectation, but with a more back-half-weighted cadence. This is a function of higher cash tax payments in Q1 and Q2, which we expect to step down in Q3. Our balance sheet strength will enable continued investment in the business as well as returns to shareholders via share repurchases and long-term dividend growth. At the end of Q1, we had $271 million in remaining authorization. Notably, we're pleased that our Board of Directors just approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, which is the largest in company history. Our commitment to return capital to shareholders is evidenced by a $0.32 per share dividend, representing 10% year-over-year growth as well as our meaningful increase in share repurchase activity in the first quarter. We plan to continue repurchasing our shares at what we consider be an aggressive pace in Q2. Additionally, in line with my comments from last quarter, we continue to expect to disposition our stake in Amentum in the first half of calendar '25, further aiding our financial position. Finally, please turn to Slide 11. We reiterate our fiscal '25 outlook for adjusted net revenue to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin to range from 13.8% to 14% and reported free cash flow conversion to be more than 100%. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance range from $5.80 to $6.20 to a new range of $5.85 to $6.20 to reflect good first quarter performance as well our lower share count expectations. The midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS would indicate over 14% growth year-over-year and the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA indicates approximately 15% growth year-over-year, highlighting our continued positive outlook for the business this year. To assist with your modeling, I will quickly highlight a few items related to fiscal '25. We anticipate revenue will rise sequentially through year-end with a more pronounced step-up between Q2 and Q3. Regarding margins, we ended up seeing a greater-than-expected benefit from the Christmas holiday timing that shifted some profitability forward. As a result, we now anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be below that of Q1. However, we continue to have good line of sight to reaching our 13.8% to 14% margin guidance for the full year and expect to see a nice step up in margins as we head into the second half of the year. Lastly, we are monitoring FX movement, particularly conversation rates for the British pound. We took a somewhat conservative view to our FX in our original forecast. And as a result, we aren't seeing a significant incremental headwind today. However, should the dollar strengthen from here, that would have an adverse translation effect on revenue and operating income. In summary, we continue to be excited about the future of Jacobs and expect fiscal '25 to be a strong foundation on which we can build. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob. Bob Pragada : Thank you, Venk. In closing, with a positive start to FY '25, we are strategically positioned to leverage revenue growth momentum across the business. We returned capital to shareholders at a historically elevated pace in the first quarter and plan to keep doing so in the second quarter demonstrating the combined power of our strong financial position and highly cash-generative business model. With our sharpened focus and capabilities, we are confident in our ability to expand market share and meet the evolving needs of our clients across all facets of our business. We look forward to engaging with you further at Investor Day, February 18. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks and good morning. Maybe just to kick it off with a broad question that we've been getting on the whole space. The numbers look obviously in line. Guidance is reiterated. But maybe if you can just talk about what you're hearing from your customers, what's reflected in your backlog in terms of the sentiment, and that's particularly focused on sort of the U.S., both government as well as commercial customers? Just trying to get an understanding of, what the customers are saying to you amidst all these headlines? Thanks. Bob Pragada : Sure. So Sabahat, it's something that we stay very, very close to. Right now, the sentiment of our customers continues to be positive. The political narrative obviously has - is pretty robust right now. And so we - it's not that we are ignoring it, we're considering it, but we're staying close to what our customers are saying. And we're seeing that, and we made a couple of comments around it. And the continued focus on the pipeline. And we're seeing double-digit pipeline growth across our end market sectors and the cadence of our awards is demonstrated in our backlog growth continues to be there. So, we're actually not seeing dramatic shifts in our customer behavior, as a result of the political narrative. Sabahat Khan : Okay. Great. And then maybe you could just talk about in terms of your margin guidance for this year. What are some of the initiatives that you've been able to execute on thus far from the time of the spin closing till now? And what are some of the initiatives that may be more focused on in the back half? Just trying to understand what's contributing to the margin improvement this year and within the context of some of the initiatives you outlined at the time of spin? Thank you. Bob Pragada : So Venk, go ahead. Venk Nathamuni : Yes. Sabahat, thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of just the margin performance, as you pointed out, we came out with solid performance in Q1 with our EBITDA margin at 13.5%. I'd say what contributed to it was primarily three or four major items. Number one is the ongoing consideration of our cost controls, and cost leverage that we've talked about in prior quarters. And then as the revenue picks up, we certainly see some operating leverage in the model. And then a couple of other things, where we're focused on internal execution is the mix, as we go through the asset life cycle, and engage earlier in the life cycle with our customers, that gives us a better margin profile. And then finally, we're also working on our global delivery model such that we can execute the functions across the globe. And say, so it's a combination of all those things that help us to get, to where we are today. Just from a Q1 to Q2 timing standpoint, I highlighted the holiday timing, which will result in a slightly lower, call it, low 13s EBITDA margin for Q2, but we feel we have a good line of sight, to getting to the 13.8% to 14% for the full year. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Bob Pragada : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : So Water and Environmental growing double-digits, I think you said you have visibility even into '26 in those end markets. Obviously, it's early in the new U.S. administration's tenure, but they have a big deregulation focus. I would surmise you don't think that is going to impact that business at all, but maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing in the confidence level, and that continued growth in that segment? Bob Pragada : Sure. Yes. It's - so we don't. So short answer, Andy, is we don't see a slowdown just, because of the needs, whether it be urbanization or age infrastructure, especially and as well as the effects of climate. So we're not seeing that. If - and again, it's a global growth story that we have seen within the water sector across all geographies. I will say this, some of the deregulation is actually, it's serving as a catalyst to accelerate some of these jobs that we have had either in our backlog, or that are in the pipeline. So, so far, whether it be regulations that you would think that would stop jobs, we have not seen that. Andy Kaplowitz : It's helpful\u2026? Venk Nathamuni : Andy, if I could just - so Andy, if I could just add to that. One of the things we talked about in the last couple of quarters, as you look at some of the large projects that we've executed that actually gives us a lot of visibility into the outer years as well. So that's what gives us confidence in our Water and Environmental solutions. Andy Kaplowitz : Great. And then maybe in the advanced manufacturing area, kind of weak right now. I think you said you see some projects maybe ramping up in the second half of the year. So maybe talk about visibility around that, because Life Sciences is quite strong right now, Advanced Manufacturing must be quite weak. So where do you get the incremental growth from, and visibility toward the bookings starting to ramp up in that segment? Bob Pragada : Yes. Let me kind of break it down, Andy. If you break down that whole sector, Life Sciences, we talked about. And in Advanced Manufacturing, we are kind of seeing a flattish performance right now in our semi business, which is actually not bad as jobs have kind of restarted, and our portfolio has diversified both from a client standpoint and a geography standpoint. So the pipeline continues to be good there. Data centers continue to be a real positive for us. I mean we are double-digit growth in our data center business. And it's now to the size where you could actually see it, it's still 40, 50 basis points, but it's actually contributing to the overall growth of the company. The area that we say has been soft, and we see - and the pipeline is growing, and that's why we have confidence in the second half is in kind of the Industrial Manufacturing depth. You saw that in the ISM data, and it's now kind of spiking back up. So we're starting to see those jobs, and especially the reshoring efforts that would be coming back to the U.S., we would be a beneficiary for that. So we're being a bit cautious on how that flows through the pipeline into our backlog, but we see some green shoots there. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Wittmann : Oh great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted a clarification to help understand the quarter a little bit better. For probably this one's for Venk. I was looking to some of your bridges, and it looks like you're taking out $3.6 million of revenue from the transition services agreement. And you're adding back $7.9 million of cost. So I guess kind of a two-part question on this one. Is that right, right now, are you losing on a GAAP basis, $4 million on the TSA? And then I guess, more - maybe the more important question is, once the TSA is over, how confident are you that you're going to be able to address that $8 million of cost in the quarter, but it's not an adjusted margin headwind a year from now? Venk Nathamuni : Yes, Andy, thanks for the question. Yes, great question. So as it relates to the TSA, clearly, we get the TSA income that's offset by the TSA expenses that we incur, and it's still a profitable engagement for us. But as you look ahead to the end of the year, clearly, we do see opportunity for us to optimize those costs, and we'll provide more color on it, but suffice it to say that, that is an opportunity for us to improve our profitability once the TSA ends and not a headwind. Andrew Wittmann : And not a headwind? Venk Nathamuni : And not a headwind. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. Great. I guess for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask on the backlog. I think I heard that you said that on a go-forward basis, you're going to refer more often, to the trailing 12-month backlog as you said it's a better reflection of what's going. I think that's probably fair and true. But can you also just talk about what you're seeing in the pipeline? You said a lot of positive things about the health of your end markets, but is the focus on TTM, a reflection of like the next couple of quarters of awards that, maybe are a little bit softer, even though maybe for the year, it's strong? I'm just - maybe I'm parsing this too closely, but I wanted to understand the change? Bob Pragada : No, it's a fair question. So it's not a reflection of things weakening. We had some larger wins. And these - some of the larger wins, especially in life sciences in water, tend to blip those up. You remember, we had a 1.7 times book-to-bill in one quarter, another 1.6 in another quarter. And those are those big hitters that come through, which tend to smooth out when you look at the profile of the types of jobs that we're winning. So that's why we felt like the trailing 12 months was more reflective. What we wanted to demonstrate from a strength standpoint, is the actual growth year-to-year in the backlog. And hence, the 19% number is the number, and it's been double-digit for several quarters in a row. And it's probably more reflective of the profile of our work from consulting and advisory, program management, design in some of our larger alternative delivery jobs. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sangita Jain : Thank you so much for taking my questions. So if I can ask on PA Consulting, obviously, the margins have held up really strong, but the revenue ramp is still lacking. So maybe you can talk about how you're seeing revenue growth build, through the year and where that may be coming from? Bob Pragada : Yes. So let me answer the second part first. The revenue ramp, we can definitely see it, and we're seeing that in our pipeline and we're seeing it in the backlog. Some of the slowness in getting the top line back to growth mode, has been the speed by, which the U.K. government has come back on some of the procurements, mostly in the public sector. We've won a few larger jobs for major U.K. public entities that, we're just waiting for the actual finalization and starting. And then once those start, we'll see that pop back in the top line. In other parts of the business, for example, the U.S. we're seeing strong double-digit top line growth. It's a smaller part of the business. So overall, some real positives in how the business is coming back, we're back in a hiring mode right now, too. I think the real positive here is that while that's going on, utilization has gone up, margins have continued to expand. And the business has got a nice healthy balance, to it moving forward. So we're positive about the future with PA. Sangita Jain : Got it. And as a follow-up, can I ask about capital allocation. So you initiated a new share buyback, you're planning to sell Amentum shares in the first calendar first half. So just wondering, if you're seeing any dislocations in the U.S. market from the macro, and policy headwinds that would encourage you to maybe look at M&A? Venk Nathamuni : Yes. Sangita, great question. As you rightly pointed out, we did increase our authorization for the share buybacks. And in the last quarter, we did $202 million of purchases, and we expect to continue to be repurchasing our shares that are, what we consider to be an aggressive pace. Now having said that, our priorities for capital allocation is number one in organic growth. That continues to be what we focus on from the standpoint of executing, on what we think are clearly lots of circular megatrends. We will continue to return cash. And M&A is certainly an option. It's not an immediate focus for us, doesn't mean that we don't do something. But we will characterize our entire strategy as we will lay out at Investor Day in a couple of weeks. But suffice it to say, organic growth is top priority, continue to return cash in the form of buybacks and dividends, and then M&A is certainly an accelerator for us. Sangita Jain : Great. Appreciate the response. Thank you. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is [Federico] speaking for Chad. I would like to focus on how much U.S. federal government exposure that Jacobs have post spin? And is there any risk to contract payment [from DOGE? How do you ring face that risk]? Bob Pragada : Yes. So we don't have - I think the question - sorry, you're a little broken up there. I think the question was around our exposure to potential federal spending and the DOGE efforts that are going on right now. We don't have exposure to DOGE in its fullest form, less than 10% of our business is tied to a federal agency. And probably 80% of that is in the defense infrastructure world where these would be buildings, infrastructure work that we do for the U.S. DoD and others. And those have continued during some of the political narratives. So we have not seen those effects, and we're staying very close to our customers, as I mentioned before, moving forward. So hopefully, that helps. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you very much Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, gentlemen. Bob Pragada : Good morning, Mike. Michael Dudas : Obviously, you have some positive trends out of U.K. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about your European business, what's going on in the Middle East, there should be some pretty good green shoots going on over there? And the Australian project is pretty broad. I assume there's more growth coming from that region as well? Bob Pragada : It's fair. Maybe I'll take them in kind of a flipped order there, Mike, when you're talking about Europe, Middle East, Australia. Maybe I'll start with the Middle East. In fact, I was just there a few weeks ago and really strong pipeline, of work that we continue to see. We've been very selective in the work that we've been going after, but especially in Saudi, that aspirational narrative envision. I can see it on the ground happening in real time, and we're in the middle of all of it. So hopefully, some exciting additional wins on the radar here, there. So feeling good about that, predominantly in the water and the infrastructure space, as well as in some of the cities and places work that kind of, brings all of our skills and capabilities together. In Europe, I'd say that our energy and power business really supporting the transition Everything from the interconnect work that we continue to do, as well as the grid modernization work and time to renewables, that continues. As well as advanced facilities, specifically around life sciences and semi work that we're starting to see, the latter parts of the chip, EU chips money that was going through. So overall - and in Scandinavia transportation. We've had a couple of nice awards that were going on there. So as the economies have been in a bit of a balance, we've continued to see nice incremental growth in Continental Europe outside of the U.K. Australia, nice turn. In fact, it was one of our, from a geographic standpoint, growth areas for the quarter, driven obviously by transportation. But we're continuing to see nice continued growth in the water sector. In addition to the big desal plant we announced a couple of quarters ago, continued water growth in Australia. So overall, a positive narrative. Michael Dudas : Appreciate that. And Venk maybe as we look through 2025 on cash, operating cash flow, some of the puts and takes, working capital changes, et cetera. The comfort level of ramping as we move through the year, to achieve the conversion targets that you're putting forth? Venk Nathamuni : Yes. Thanks, Mike. So I'd say just from the standpoint of our capital allocation, as I mentioned before, the organic growth is the primary objective here. And so with that in mind, in terms of just the margin profile, as we said, off to a very strong start to the year with 13.5% EBITDA margin. We see a little bit of a dip in Q2 just, because of timing reasons on the holiday that I mentioned, on the prepared remarks. And then we should see a nice pick up in Q3 and Q4. And then as it relates to free cash flow and conversion, we're still on target to get to the 100% plus free cash flow conversion. A couple of one-time items to think about in Q1 and Q2. In Q1, we had some one-off cash tax payment associated with the divestiture of the CMS business. And then in Q2, is when we do a traditional estimated tax payments. So when you take that into account, the first couple of quarters, we'll see a little bit below, but overall for the full year, still pretty comfortable with the 100% plus free cash flow conversion. Michael Dudas : Thanks guys. See you in Miami. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Judah Aronovitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Judah Aronovitz : Hi, good morning. This is Judah Aronovitz on for Steven Fisher. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, I think you talked about a second half reacceleration in international infrastructure markets. So it sounds like there's some good momentum there. And if that's still kind of the expectation, what's giving you the confidence in that reacceleration? Is that work in backlog already? Or are you expecting some more bookings? Thanks. Bob Pragada : Yes. I think when we made that comment, Judah, we talked about kind of the consistent growth in the water market across geographies, and that was in our international markets as well. So yes, that has continued in driving that growth in the second half. The other piece is in what we call our cities and places work, which is around some of the GigaCity and larger programs that we see. Middle East gets highlighted quite a bit, and it should be. But we're starting to see that effort in the U.K. as well as in Australia and Southeast Asia as well. So overall, I'd say it's a pretty much diversified blend of our end markets showing promise in the international space. Judah Aronovitz : Thanks. That's it from me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Bubes : This is Adam on for Jerry. In program management, that's a service line that engineering news record shows you having a really strong market position, and its service line we're hearing is benefiting from a rising mix of large projects. How big is that business for you today? What's the growth trajectory look like? And is there an opportunity to expand further there going forward? Bob Pragada : Yes. I'd say, Adam, it's a strong capability. We don't see that as a vertical. We see it as a cross-cutting capability across our end markets, as well as our geographies. So it's a great, great skill set that we have. And from a growth standpoint, it is - it's in line and higher. It's driving that growth trajectory for the company. And it's something that if you think about any one of our end markets, that program management capability allows us to play across the entirety of the asset life cycle, from Business Advisory all the way through to delivery of the program, driving business transformation for our clients. Adam Bubes : And then can you just put into context the benefit from your initiatives, to engage with clients at the early phases of the project in terms of that benefit to margins? How much do margins on those more advisory consulting lines differ from the portfolio average? Venk Nathamuni : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'd say, at a high level, what it allows us to initially is to be involved with the customer at an earlier stage of the process. So it gives us a lot of visibility into their long-term thinking, and help shape their long-term thinking. That's one of the big benefits that gives us additional scope across the entire project lifetime, if you will. And then the added benefit is obviously, as we move up the value chain, we're able to get higher margins than corporate average. But clearly, it varies from engagement-to-engagement. So it's hard to quantify exactly what that is. It will depend on the nature of the project and the nature of the end market and so forth. But suffice it to say, on average, it's higher than the corporate gross margins. Adam Bubes : Great, thanks so much. Venk Nathamuni : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Wilson with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Kevin Wilson : Hi, good morning. Calling on behalf of Jamie Cook. Thanks for the time. My question is on tariffs. Of course, the state of play sort of changes every day there. I think you have relatively small exposure to the markets that are initially the target, Canada, Mexico, China, just in terms of where your projects are actually happening. But I'm curious, bigger picture as a U.S. based firm, to what extent are you thinking about the risk to projects in the pipeline, or your win rates or your competitive positioning in international broadly just in light of more aggressive U.S. foreign policy in the form of tariffs or otherwise? Thanks. Bob Pragada : Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. We actually - we're not going to speculate on what is - what it could mean, because right now, what we do is we're staying close to our clients, what it means for their business. And let's take the Canadian one, for example. As the narrative is getting way out ahead, what this does represent for us is an opportunity to be a key and trusted adviser for our clients, in how that might have an effect on their supply chains. And actually, our clients have been coming to us asking for that type of advice. So we're not seeing it as a huge threat. Rather, we see it as an opportunity to assist our clients while that political narrative continues to oscillate in different directions. Kevin Wilson : Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is just on restructuring costs. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm wondering if you could provide an update on your expectations for the year. I think last quarter, you guided to $75 million to $95 million there, just the Q1 number at a lower run rate than that. So just updated expectations on level and cadence for restructuring for the rest of the year? Thanks. Venk Nathamuni : Yes, Kevin, great question. As you rightly pointed out, last time we guided for $75 million to $95 million. We're still sticking with that guidance and on track to be in line with that. I'd just say from a timing standpoint, obviously, it depends on invoicing and such. But suffice it to say, we don't see a major spike in any given quarter. It should be fairly steady through the rest of the fiscal year for us, and well within that range. Kevin Wilson : Understood. Thank you. Venk Nathamuni : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Bob Pragada for closing comments. Bob Pragada : Well, thank you everyone, for joining our earnings call. We look forward to sharing our long-term strategy, and speaking with all of our investors and analysts during our upcoming Investor Day. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
