With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Sheehan. Kevin? Kevin Sheehan - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Andrea and good morning everyone. The first quarter of 2014 was one that we at Norwegian have looked forward to ever since my executive team and I began laying the foundation for reestablishing our share in the marketplace. Back in 2010 where we placed the order for our two breakaway class vessels, we looked ahead to this quarter knowing it would mark the beginning of a fundamental shift in our earnings from not one, but two of the largest, most innovative, most efficient and most profitable ships in our fleet. The resulting 23% increase in capacity in the quarter translated into a fourfold increase in adjusted EPS, a 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a commensurate 200 basis point expansion in margin. Along with strong results, the highlight of the quarter was without a doubt the introduction of the Norwegian Getaway into our fleet. Our latest ship joined the fleet in January as the second vessel in our Breakaway class. Our new build team work diligently to have the ship ready a full month ahead of schedule. The additional preparation time resulted in incredibly smooth launch with a crew that before a single guest that stepped onboard was ready to deliver a level of service commensurate with a ship that had been sailing for months and today leads the fleet in guest satisfaction. This additional investment in crew time was extremely valuable as Norwegian Getaway embarked on one of the busiest and most successful set of inaugural sailings in our history. These events included European inaugural ceremonies in Rotterdam and South Hampton and the Bud Light Hotel in New York, where extremely important in gaining exposure for our new ship. I have been told many times how Norwegian has such an outsized reach and reputation for our size. We do this by consistently finding new and innovative ways to gain exposure for our brand. We did this in South Hampton by having travel partners bring aboard some of their best clients who had either never cruised on Norwegian or perhaps never cruised at all. These clients were able to get a taste of our Freestyle Cruising offering of freedom and flexibility, which either exposed experienced cruisers to our unique proposition or set the expectation for non-cruisers of an enhanced experience versus a traditional cruise. We also gained exposure by chartering Norwegian Getaway as the event venue for the Bud Light Hotel during Super Bowl XLVIII, an event that garnered 1 billion impressions worldwide. If there was such a metric as return on exposure in the cruise industry, this event would have set the bar. This kind of out of the box thinking expands to our partnership strategy, where we have aligned Norwegian with equally well-established like minded brands such as the Radio City Rockettes, the Miami Dolphins, the New York Nicks. These partnerships also extend to our ships to help deliver an even better guest experience. Our guest programming received an instant boost after the launching of our partnership with Nickelodeon with the initial launch on the Norwegian Epic in 2010 while our most recent partnership with Michael Mondavi Family Estate will elevate our wine \u2013 our fine wine offerings throughout the fleet with the help of California\u2019s first family of wine makings. We have also taken advantage of expanding brands that we have cultivated in-house. Moderno Churrascaria began as a venue on the Norwegian Epic where it was the first Brazilian style steakhouse at sea. The concept proved extremely popular from the start, which made it a natural choice to introduce to our other ships. Another example is the recently announced expansion of the popular O\u2019Sheehan\u2019s bar and grill throughout the fleet with conversions beginning in May. Whether on Norwegian Epic with the concept debuted or on the Norwegian Breakaway or Getaway, O\u2019Sheehan\u2019s is constantly a hub of activity and a relaxed meeting place for guests of all ages. Adding the concept to the new vessels will provide the same central meeting place experience while offering guests additional complimentary dining option onboard. While Norwegian has been a leading industry innovator since our founding in 1966, we took our biggest and boldest step in the year 2000 with the introduction of Freestyle cruising. While some may find the idea of doing away with single main dining room, assigned dining times and nightly dress codes in favor of various dining venues with no set times or dress codes a new concept. We at Norwegian have been doing it for close to 15 years. Our entire fleet is purpose built for Freestyle cruising and we offer a variety of dining venues to choose from allowing our guests the freedom and flexibility to tailor their vacation experience to their liking. Since our debut we have been honing this Freestyle cruising concept, not just by expanding the number of dining venues, but also by extending choice to the entertainment experience, eliminating the traditional large theater format in favor of a variety of intermittent entertainment venues throughout the ship. This ultimate expression of Freestyle cruising can be found on Norwegian Breakaway and Getaway whose performance in the pricing, onboard revenue and efficiency fronts to an improvement in the core fleet to help deliver the strong results in the quarter and accelerate our best in class operating metrics. While Wendy will go through these metrics in more detail, I would steal a little bit of her thunder to reiterate this quarter included an almost four-fold increase in adjusted EPS and approximately 4% increase in net yield that is running over very strong comps in 2013 of 3.3% and a 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA with a 200 basis point expansion in margin. These results are impressive regardless of the industry, but they are more so given the quarter and the environment that turn more promotional than we had anticipated. As we have repeatedly stated, we are focused on driving for our rightful pricing and entered the quarter driving for price, in this instance at the expense of some occupancy. As the quarter progressed, we made adjustments in pricing where needed to get to the finish line. And in the end we are pleased with how the quarter turned out. Our first quarter net yield increase was driven by higher ticket pricing, a great accomplishment given the first quarter of 2013 has a dual advantage of building on strong bookings leading into Wave and avoiding the direct impact from industry disruptions that began in the later part of the Wave season of 2013. Strong bookings going to the Wave prior to the industry disruption was also the story in 2012. Now, after two years of unusually strong booking positions going into Wave, it was only natural that 2014 returned to a more normal pattern. This normalization was in no doubt exacerbated by the most brutal winters on record, one that included unusual weather phenomenon like the polar vortex that had the dampening effect on consumer spending throughout the economy. To contend with these headwinds has required an increased level of promotion compared to prior years, which has resulted in adjustment to our view of the net yield for the remainder of the year. But as I have stated time and again, our main financial objectives at Norwegian are to deliver consistent quarterly earnings growth and to drive up the return to our shareholders. We have demonstrated our adherence to these objectives quarter in and quarter out. Our expectation for a 60% earnings growth in the year, once again demonstrates our commitment to these objectives, which are based on our young, modern fleet, the passion of our crew to deliver a great vacation experience and our strategy to obtain a rightful price for our differentiated product offering. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that our incredible assets, passionate crew and disciplined strategies will allow us to taking advantage of the early signs of improvement in the marketplace going forward. Now, let me turn the call over to Wendy to review the results of the quarter along with our guidance in a little more detail. Wendy Beck - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning everyone. The following commentary, unless otherwise noted, compares first quarter 2014 and 2013 on an as reported basis. As Kevin stated earlier, strong results from the quarter were boosted by the earnings power delivered by our newest vessel as well as strength in the core fleet, the combination of which led to an increase in top line revenue by 26%. Now, revenue in the period increased 27.8% to $499.3 million from $390.7 million on a 23.2% increase in capacity days coupled with a 3.8% increase in net yields. Capacity days increased as a result of a full quarter of sailings from Norwegian Breakaway, which entered the fleet in April 2013, along with a partial quarter of sailings from our newest ship, Norwegian Getaway, partially offset by a drydock for Norwegian Spirit. Looking at net yield, the improvement of 3.8% or 3.9% on a constant currency basis came primarily from an increase in net ticket yield of 4.9% coupled with a 1.3% increase in net onboard yields. Turning to cost, adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day excluding fuel increased 3.7% or 3.4% on a constant currency basis. As a result of the few factors including launch and inaugural cost for Norwegian Getaway which included inaugural event in Rotterdam, South Hampton, New York, and Miami that brought significant exposure to the ship on both sides of the Atlantic. There were also incremental drydock expenses in the period. You will recall that the first quarter of last year included the first few days of a drydock For Pride of America that extended into Q2. This year Norwegian Spirit underwent an almost three-week drydock which was fully in the period resulting in incremental expense for those additional days. In addition after carrying out planned projects, we took the opportunity to invest an additional $2 million in system upgrades onboard, which were not contained in our previous guidance. Lastly, there were some additional expenses related to enhanced security during the Norwegian Jade charter in Sochi during the Winter Olympics. Fuel expense for the quarter benefited from both lower prices and consumption. Fuel price per metric ton net of hedges in the period decreased to $643 million from $673 million in 2013. In addition, fuel consumption per capacity day decreased 6.8% excluding the month long dockside charter in Sochi for Norwegian Jade and charter events for Norwegian Getaway, which contributed another 0.7%. The benefits from our capital structure optimization initiatives carried out in 2013 are apparent in our interest expense line item. Interest expense net in the first quarter of 2014 was $31.2 million compared to $37.2 million in 2013 after adjusting for $90.5 million in charges related to the prepayment of certain credit facilities and the redemption of our high rate senior notes. The reduction in our weighted average cost of debt in the quarter to 3.8% from 5.4% in 2013 more than offset the incremental debt related to the financing for Norwegian Breakaway and Getaway. Looking ahead with all else being equal, our weighted average cost of debt should only improve as Norwegian Escape and Bliss enter the fleet with financing in extremely attractive interest rates. The quarter also included an income tax benefit of $9.4 million compared to an expense of $2.2 million in the prior year. The income tax benefit in 2014 is primarily related to a change in our corporate entity structure that was completed in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the tax provision reflected in interest expense deduction based on a method supported by the information available at the time. During the first quarter of 2014, we received additional information, which allowed us to elect an alternative acceptable tax method resulting in the tax benefit of which $6.7 million is excluded in our adjusted EPS. The impact of increased capacity, stronger net yield and lower interest expense partially offset by higher net cruise costs for capacity day resulted in strong bottom line improvement in the quarter including an increase in adjusted earnings per share to $0.23 from $0.06, a 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 200 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Looking further out in 2014, we have provided guidance along with associated sensitivities for the second quarter and full year 2014 in our earnings release. Unless otherwise noted, the following guidance metrics are both on an as reported and constant currency basis. It is important to keep the following commentary in mind while reviewing guidance for the second quarter. We are rolling our strong net yield comps from 2013 as a result of two factors. First, while industry disruptions last year eventually necessitated pricing actions to close out voyages, our initial view underestimated the duration of the impacts from the disruption, and we maintained a higher pricing position for a longer period. Second, with Norwegian Breakaway\u2019s debut view in the second quarter of last year, we are rolling over the extremely favorable yields that a first in class ship typically delivers on its first handful of voyages. That said, even when rolling over strong comps and working in a promotional environment, we are anticipating a net yield increase between 3% and 3.5%. We forecast net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day to decrease between 2% to 3%, while adjusted EPS in the quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. For the full year 2014, net yield is forecast to increase between 3% and 3.5%, while we anticipate net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day to decline 1% to 2%. In addition, current projected fuel prices along with consumption efficiencies including better than expected fuel performance from the recent Getaways will benefit the bottom line. As a result we are reiterating adjusted EPS guidance for the full year of $2.20 to $2.35. Now looking at the deployment for the second quarter, 38% of our capacity is in the Caribbean, with 23% in Europe, 11% in Bermuda, and 10% in Alaska. The balance of our deployment is in other itineraries including Hawaii and repositioning voyages. Highlighting some markets in our deployment, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy as consistent deployment and commitment for the European markets in the form of improved pricing and occupancy as we go into the third consecutive year of our four ship seasonal deployment from Europe. Also of notice, Alaska, particularly our (open jaws) seven day voyages on Norwegian Sun, you will recall that we introduced this unique new itinerary last year and as expected it took some time for both travel partners and guests to absorb the new offering. The product has found its footing and is showing stronger pricing and booked position versus last year demonstrating that our strategy of keeping consistent offerings while it may include some time for awareness to grow during their introduction, results in these products being successfully absorbed by the marketplace and contributing to overall yield growth. Before turning the call back to Kevin, I would just like to recap. We posted strong net yield performance for the first quarter versus tougher year-over-year comps. Net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day grew slightly more than anticipated due to opportunistic work completed on the drydock for Norwegian Spirit. Fuel benefited from lower prices as well as improved consumption while interest benefited from the various initiatives to optimize our capital structure. The final result is earnings growth of almost 300% on an adjusted basis. Looking ahead, we are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which translates to 60% earnings growth and reinforces our objective of delivering the consistent orderly earnings growth that we have become known for. With that, I will turn over the call to Kevin for some closing comments. Kevin? Kevin Sheehan - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks Wendy. With both Norwegian Breakaway and Getaway in the fleet together for the first time it is worth noting that this quarter\u2019s capacity increase marks the largest single quarter capacity increase in our current new build program. It is quite a task to absorb a 23% increase in capacity in the single quarter, but our results demonstrate that this mission was successfully accomplished. Looking ahead to later years, we have announced our itineraries for the winter season of 2015 and 2016. One of the highlights of the season is Norwegian Epic\u2019s move to the \u2013 from seasonal to year round sailings in Europe from Barcelona. This move demonstrates our commitment to enhancing our presence in Europe allowing us to reap more of the benefits of this market by deploying one of the world\u2019s largest and most innovative premium ships to the region year round. In addition, this year round deployment removes almost a month of low yielding Transatlantic voyages per year further enhancing overall yields. Another benefit of Norwegian Epic\u2019s move to Europe is that it allows for Norwegian Escape to enter the Miami market in November of 2015 with minimal incremental capacity in the Caribbean. The addition of Norwegian Escape to the fleet provides the opportunity grow our global footprint. This expansion includes a return of seasonal voyages in South America along with the addition of Port Canaveral as the new seasonal homeport. We have a lot to look forward to at Norwegian in the coming years as this exciting new deployment not only adds fuel to the growth that will come from the addition of the state-of-the-art Breakaway plus class of our fleet. Before going into Q&A, I\u2019d like to discuss the recent approvals from our board, which authorizes a three-year $500 million share repurchase program. This program allows us to be opportunistic to repurchase shares at attractive levels and return value to our shareholders. With that, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sheehan. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning or good afternoon for all of you on \u2013 from management. A couple of issues. One, could you just talk more about the timing of share buyback? And also can you also, Kevin, maybe just speak to something, which is a broader issue and although I think we are seeing it in this quarter or in this guidance is the ability for Norwegian to offset some of the broader industry trends. When do you think NCLH can start to standout relative to the competition on pricing, in particular. It seems at least to us like Disney can do this. So, that\u2019s the second question. And the first one is just timing of share buyback and how to think about it. Kevin Sheehan : Yes. So, as you know Steve, we have been talking about the cash flow of the business. And I think what I had been saying in the past was that as we looked into the second half of the year, our cash flow was at the point where our shareholders will be saying hey, what are doing with the cash, one would expect you wouldn\u2019t want us payback 2% debt as an example. So, the stock price and where it is today accelerated that process. So, we feel that the stock is not reflective of the potential of our business and the earnings that we have achieved. So, you can expect \u2013 we\u2019ll step into this and in this quarter and then continue along and who knows what happens as we get into the next couple of years as our cash flow really starts to accelerate. And as far as your second question, I can\u2019t tell you, I really feel like we have stood out significantly from the industry. And we compete with two great competitors have \u2013 who have a lot of brands, but if you take a look at the pricing in the first quarter, we are probably from a pricing standpoint 800 or 900 basis points different than the other player. So, I am sure why you don\u2019t think that\u2019s stepping out. The industry has been impacted with a variety of things as you understand the market, but in that given environment we are producing some significant positive pricing in an environment, where the \u2013 as I said the other players have not. If you look at the ticket pricing in the first quarter, I think we do stand out quite a bit. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : I was more focused on net yield, Kevin, but I guess you\u2019ve answered that. Kevin Sheehan : Yes. I think that \u2013 when you take the ticket in the onboard and you look at the fact that we did \u2013 we did give a little bit on the load this quarter, because we are driving for prices everyone knows and we will be relentless on that, but at the end of the day we had to be cognizant of filling the ships to drive the onboard revenue as well. So, I do think when you look at our performance, it\u2019s \u2013 we have stepped up significantly over the last number of years from where we were a distant third to being best-in-class. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley - UBS: Great, thanks. Two questions. One is it seems like China is getting more important as a source market and I wonder if you could comment on any discussions that you may have about doing something jointly there? And then also just sort of any indication when their share sale kind of a timing for their share sale to be resolved? Kevin Sheehan : Okay. Yes, as far as Asia that\u2019s been on our radar. It will continue to be I would suspect that over the next year or so you will see some action from us as far as moving our footprint as we want to be a global player. But right now that the realty is with 13 ships, we are able and one being in Hawaii and one being in the three port a day itinerary, we have plenty of opportunities in the markets we know with certainty that we can perform. And as we get there, we will look to those other markets in Asia. It\u2019s an important piece of the future strategy and we are eyes wide open on that. As far as the guessing ownership, there is really no news on that, the \u2013 what they have done is just clear the requirement with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and they didn\u2019t want to go back and do with the second time etcetera, etcetera. So this way they have gone what they need to do and we\u2019ll see what happens. But they are just informally the Kevin view of things they do understand the business model they see the earnings growth that\u2019s coming, no different in the private equity guys who are just again from the Kevin view of things are seeing at the stock price is now where they would like it to be and our \u2013 I suspect taking wait and see attitude on selling their shares. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Your line is open. Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup: Great, yes, could you walk us through how the Caribbean trends are developed over the last three months and in particular since the industry lapping the tramp incident in mid February both from a booking and a pricing perspective is kind of how things have been progressing for you? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, it\u2019s a good question because we had the year-end call, the wave season started out not as stellar as we \u2013 we\u2019re hoping for as an industry I suspect that\u2019s what we refer from the other players as well. But as we got into it and we did get to that mid February point we\u2019re seeing the bookings trends and some of it is the promotional stuff that is still going on, but the sense that the booking levels have started to take hold and now we\u2019re beginning to feel that things could start to improve. We\u2019ve had significant positive bookings every week for the last 10 weeks I would say and which is put us into a very good book position and when you\u2019re in that position you then have better control of your pricing so, it\u2019s a little early to be saying with certainty but showing to feel little better about the landscape and I do think when we are all back to filling our ships consistently that brings that the whole revenue management back into play enables us to really start to move things again. So I think we just as a little bit of a soft spot in because of the Caribbean and remember the Caribbean, a couple of years ago was we look at is a great market and the whole industry did. It\u2019s the (indiscernible) theory, right we all sat in our rooms and we did our itinerary planning on our own of course and then it all \u2013 we all concluded that it make sense to go into the Caribbean and low and behold we announced pretty much the same time and it\u2019s like you show your hand and then everybody is in the Caribbean and the capacity being up 20%. It\u2019s no different than what we went through I think in Alaska last year will be to another ship in there. We had a little bit of a growing team in Alaska and now the ship that the new ship in the itinerary is booking the best of our three. So, I\u2019m confident that what we gone through as an industry in 2014 becomes hopefully the opportunity to be realized for 2015. Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup: Good, very helpful color. And then just finally a Europe which seems to be strong for all the major players, what do you seeing there and then I think next year there is going to be some additional capacity how you see, what is your expectation for next year? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, I think we\u2019re filling quite confident that Europe has gotten back to being in the right trend for the foreseeable future. I suspect based on what we have been hearing as well as what we are seeing in our company, we are doing very well from a yield standpoint in Europe. But remember that was off of the very low comps. So, the proof will be in the putting as we get into next year to continue the \u2013 I think you\u2019re going to see a couple more years of nice growth as the market continues to improve and Americans continue to get back to Europe and the once in a lifetime type vacation experiences. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty confident about Europe and we think our timing was bringing the epic back as the full year shift over there and winning the well travel holdings of we\u2019re the best ship in the industry \u2013 best ship in Europe, excuse me, we feel pretty confident with that. Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendricks with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendricks \u2013 Barclays: Hi, good afternoon. Kevin Sheehan : Hey, Felicia, how you are doing? Felicia Hendricks \u2013 Barclays: Good. Kevin, your comments that things are feeling better at the end of your prepared remarks and then in response to the prior question we\u2019re encouraging just wondering if you could help us understand things are feeling better and also in light of the strong yield just on the quarter. Can you just help frame the new net yield guidance for the year? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, so I would say the early part of the wave season and what we went through in the early part of this so, we did have good bookings to get back on the right booking curve which we\u2019ve gone through. I think is an industry so as I said now where I feel like we are in a better position as an industry to start to navigate some real pricing as we move forward. But having said that as you know the bookings for the second, third and fourth quarter are substantially for the second quarter a little bit less for the third quarter, four quarter, I think it\u2019s still an opportunity but it\u2019s too early to tell I think when we got on to the second quarter, I would look to have some positive news we\u2019re working like mad to drive our pricing as you know was the biggest focus on this company and we understand completely that the top-line is critical to get a multiple that we preserve and I think given what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the spectrum of what you\u2019ve seen in the industry I think we\u2019ve done that and I think it becomes clear as the market moves forward and this is such an underpriced industry and such an underpriced occasion experience as consumers get back to it and you feel like it was a whole range of things and it was an unusual winter that delayed people calling to make their bookings. So that is now starting to feel like it\u2019s with the bunch of weeks of very solid booking activity. I think we have a short actually start to move in the right direction. Felicia Hendricks \u2013 Barclays: Okay, that\u2019s great. And then still the revision is more driven by pricing and something you would might been seeing in on-board. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, I think we are pretty solid with our on-board as we move through the rest of the year, I mean, there is so much stuff it\u2019s going on it\u2019s the positive, I just hope everybody understands we have \u2013 if you remember on the fourth quarter call, I eluded to that we are seeing it\u2019s very encouraging sign of the fuel efficiency of the Getaway. Do you know when we go through the quarter now we\u2019re 10 weeks into it. We are projecting a $5 plus million improvement in our fuel based on now that we\u2019re in the itinerary, we\u2019re running it, we see the fuel utilization when these comment on a 6.8% improvement in fuel costs consumption per capacity day that\u2019s incredible, I hope everybody understands how powerful that is and the on-board experience as you know these ships are build the profit and is now as I said getting the right customers back on the ships and we\u2019re on that booking curve that enable us to start to get back with the right people on the ships that will drive that on-board experience. So we\u2019re pretty confident with what we\u2019re going we think the O\u2019Sheehan\u2019s concept and all of that we have in ship will just keep people out and spending money we also think it has a side benefits of getting people more variety in the complimentary dining venues. So, we really do feel like the company is on a role now and we\u2019re excited about every day is coming. Felicia Hendricks \u2013 Barclays: Great. One final one on housekeeping, can you \u2013 could you give us a color on your new deployment, what percentage of your deployment will now be in the Caribbean next year in Europe? Wendy Beck : In Europe for the full year in \u201915 will be 21% and 45% for the Caribbean on a full year basis. Felicia Hendricks \u2013 Barclays: Thank you so much. Kevin Sheehan : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Steve Wieczynski - Stifel: Yes, good morning guys. So, Kevin I guess first question you talked about reducing or sacrificing occupancy for price at this point, can you just maybe dig into that a little bit more, do you plan on using that same type of approach I mean going forward for the foreseeable future? Kevin Sheehan : No, I think the reality is and you saw it with one of our competitors of having I think had the right intention of trying to hold price. But at the end of the day remember we have to be cognizant of the fact that we have 30% of our revenue coming on board. So there is only so much you can do and within 100 basis points or whatever the range is you want to navigate as best you can, but I don\u2019t think we would ever be reckless in holding price and have a lot of empty cabins because that has a double edge sword there. Steve Wieczynski - Stifel: Okay, got it. And then second with Escape, can you talk a little bit how you guys came to the decision in terms of putting \u2013 deciding on putting Escape in home port that in Miami, I guess we get a lot of questions about having that side by side there with Getaway. And is it especially given all the concerns with the Caribbean is it fair to say that Getaway could potentially be redeployed at some point? Kevin Sheehan : No, I think what happens is the Epic is being redeployed and we moved the ship to South America. So when you look at our capacity in the Caribbean it\u2019s almost flat when we moved into \u201915 and \u201916. So it\u2019s not a big spike, it\u2019s really just putting the right assets in there, so we now have a year round Eastern Caribbean and a year round Western Caribbean ship. And remember the Pearl that\u2019s been down there is almost completely chartered for the fringe period. The Epic will see Europe I just said that there is another ship moves to South America. Steve Wieczynski - Stifel: Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open. Kevin Sheehan : Hi Harry Harry Curtis - Nomura: Hi, good morning. Just going back to the share repo, the stock is not exactly liquid, how excited are you to actually remove some liquidity from a less liquid stock. And maybe the bigger issue is at least for the stock the overhang in the stock has been 60 day lockups that\u2019s been created. And so to what degree do you communicate with your sponsors about a more significant links to the lockup, which would allow your value, the value of your company to better reflect your earnings growth? Kevin Sheehan : I can\u2019t really get into too much based on them with the lockups as you know that that\u2019s kind of like in the private equity world of what they do. But I can tell you by the (indiscernible) in our Board meeting this morning that these guys are not looking to be running for the doors. They are not happy with the stock price. They are comfortable sitting and waiting. But I don\u2019t think that they would be entertaining changing what they have done as the game plan from their standpoint over the years. But I would certainly can suggest that yes, you are right it\u2019s a good point on the liquidity. I think the only opportunity there is when the stock is weak that opportunistically we could be in the marketplace. And then as we move down to the future we could have a marriage of some blocks with the private equity guys when they are selling (indiscernible). So we are going to do what these shareholders would want us to do and we will be smart about it. But I don\u2019t want to really give away anything too detailed. Harry Curtis - Nomura: I guess what I am getting at is do you think that they really appreciate that it\u2019s the short duration of the lockup that is actually hurt \u2013 impeding the stock price from getting the value that it might normally get? Kevin Sheehan : We have done this a thousand times at both Apollo and TPG. I am not sure that they \u2013 it\u2019s almost like saying to them would you entertain doing a different type of transaction. They have a game plan the way they do it. The only thing I can suggest if they are not happy with the stock price and I am not looking to do anything from my eye contact with them at the moment they think the stock, it\u2019s got a long way to run. But I will talk to them about the 60 days lockup I just \u2013 I am not sure what they would say to that. Harry Curtis - Nomura: Fair enough, I just wanted to get that out there. Thanks. Kevin Sheehan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities : Thank you. Anything Kevin that you can give a little additional color and I appreciate what you have given so far, but your booked load factors as they stand now looking over the balance of the year the remaining three quarters of the year. And then also that in pricing by region whether you are equal or behind if you can just \u2013 you talked about Europe being strong or Alaska being strong, but just overall your book load factors and in the pricing and up down on a year-over-year basis? Kevin Sheehan : Sure. And I will be careful to be too specific given the fact that we are one brand and we are competing with two huge companies. But I would say that starting with the load situation we are significantly favorable in our load position right now. We are as well in Europe across the Baltic, all of which are significantly booked better than last year. We are on par pretty much with Hawaii. And then where we are also heavily booked is in the Canada and New England which is a good thing. So you get that done and get it out of the way. And then the Caribbean still has opportunities to improve on our booking, but that is the major focus where we are in the market up in New York and we are in the market in Miami. So we are seeing some momentum from that and so that will hopefully help for load and the pricing across Europe is very healthy double digits. Alaska is in the zone of being low single digit positive. Hawaii is doing well as it has been for years now. Canada, New England is priced well and the Caribbean is still a little bit behind where we would like it to be. Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities : Great, okay. And then along the comment I guess Harry was making, we agree with that and also heard from some clients if there would be anyway to encourage Genting to make some type of public statement either a press release or via the press one way or the other, press interview or something, just hey here is regulatory filing we have got to have it out there per Hong Kong regulations, but it is not our intent to sell everything from this 12 months period. I think that also would just give some confidence into the market. And at the end of the day maximize that value, everybody should be happy, Genting, Apollo, TPG, everyone. But I think just maybe a little bit of additional comfort from some of the larger holders might be helpful from a public statement standpoint. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, and I have jotted down both your and Harry\u2019s comment and we appreciate them. Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research. Your line is open. James Hardiman - Longbow Research : Hi, thanks for taking my call. One of my questions has been answered. I did want to ask sort of the yield question in a slightly different way. And you lowered yield guidance, it was a pretty small reduction and what I feel like I am hearing is that maybe since the last time you talked to us things got a little bit better, and then a little bit worse, and then they got a little bit better over the last handful of weeks. But can you just talk about where that yield guidance stands today I guess along two dimensions first by geography I am assuming that the reduction is primarily Caribbean where there are some offsets to that in some other regions. And I guess secondarily core fleet versus the two new ships, how you historically talked about the premiums that you get, you made of a note of underscoring the double digit premiums of Getaway and Breakaway that those still hold. How should I think about pricing on the core fleet, has that relationship held and everything has come down or how should I think about that. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, that\u2019s great question. That is actually what has happened. So remember you are in an environment and when you see it contract a little bit for the overall industry that has taken place, but the Getaway and the Breakaway within that span of business still has its double digit premium and we expect that to be. And as I had mentioned earlier on an earlier call the Epic is about to enter its fifth year and continues to command that premium. So we don\u2019t expect that to change. But what you have is the industry dynamics that you have to work your way through and it affects the entire things. Yes, what the core fleet is a little bit lower than we thought when we came into the year and that\u2019s why you see the revision, but its still has got that same relationship to the new ships. Great, and it\u2019s really the Caribbean is for the most part the situation that the yield for 2014 for the industry. James Hardiman - Longbow Research : Very helpful. And then I guess to stand on the Caribbean you talked about in your prepared remarks that given some reallocation of some deployments that your own capacity was only going to be up slightly in the Caribbean next year. I think royal said something very similar to that. How should I think about industry wide capacity in the Caribbean next year, it seems like it\u2019s going to be very reasonable. How do you guys think about pricing and I guess especially in the wake of the news that royal is moving a very significant shift over to China. How should we think about 2015 and sort of the price dynamics? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic here to be honest with you, by the way it\u2019s 45% going down to 42% next year for us and I don\u2019t know if you saw recently the news that EMC is returning to Europe a part of the year with their new ship, that was a big part of the situation that happen this year. So I\u2019m feeling that the market size in the Caribbean is getting back to where it needs to be for \u201915 and should move and it\u2019s a way it is. As I said several times as the industry has proven once in the repeatedly that it has periods where they too much stuff goes into one market and then recalibrates or you get the travel agents attention on that market and the consumer and then the business builds. So, I think it\u2019s looking to me like it\u2019s going to be a better environment in \u201915 and we have similarly continue to grow our chart business in the \u2013 in that part of the market with our Norwegian Pearl. James Hardiman - Longbow Research : Excellent, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Your line is open. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust: Hi, good afternoon. Just two quick questions here. Just clarification on the share repurchases, those are not any assumptions of share repurchase that are not included in your earnings guidance, is that correct? Kevin Sheehan : You\u2019re correct. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust: Okay, fantastic. And then just want a little clarification here, it looks like you raised, excuse me, removed about $0.08 of fuel cost from the full year guidance but your hedging is really is unchanged from the last quarter and I guess I think about that in relation to royal raised their fuel cost expectations for the year. How should I think about what\u2019s different, is it your expectation for your newer ships will just be more efficient then you had previously thought? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, okay. So let me take that. I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the realization of the hard work we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple of years. I joke with Wendy that she goes on at ad nauseam about all the initiatives we have a group of things that we\u2019ve done on fuel efficiency over the last two or three years that goes on for pages and we\u2019re seeing that benefit in the organic fleet, we are seeing the benefits of about $2.5 plus million for the remainder of the year in our fuel consumption. We\u2019re also seeing as I said the Getaway is $5 million to $6 million in better than what we had budgeted and what we expected and I gave you that early indication on the fourth quarter call and we are given our hedge position actually benefiting from the pricing for the remainder of that. So, I\u2019m sure how they are just on and we can\u2019t really be looking at there and say to why we different, but I think I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve been able to do from an appeal standpoint on all the fronts that we\u2019ve been working on and just shows that you\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s working on every single line item like we\u2019ve been doing since we got here six years ago. Andrea DeMarco : Great. So we have one \u2013 we have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Your line is open. Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research : Hi, guys, good afternoon. Congratulations Kevin on your new directorship that seems like a full plate and especially congratulations to the whole team on the 5% ticket increase, I think that was quite spectacular and hasn\u2019t been pointed out enough, I believe. Quick question on Q3, Kevin you mention that Q4 might provide an opportunity, but it seems that Q3 pricing is very stable at this point and given that a significant percentage of your capacity is in Europe which is doing so well, Q3 is going to be good quarter, does it sound like a fair statement? Kevin Sheehan : I think it\u2019s good relative to the yield guidance that we\u2019ve given where we are, where we expect to finish, I think we \u2013 could use you in our revenue management team by the way and I\u2026 Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research : I would love to work for you for free for a month, could I \u2013 I am only an hour away so it\u2019s going to be an easy commute. Kevin Sheehan : And I\u2019m very optimistic, I shouldn\u2019t say very optimistic, cautiously optimistic about the fourth quarter. We have enough time here to be as smart as possible. We are solidly booked. The environment looks pretty good. It\u2019s just a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s been three years in a row, I thought we had a good situation as we rode into the fourth quarter, only to have stuff that slows us down. So again, I am cautiously optimistic if the industry continues to not have any noise in it. I think we have a good shot as we move forward. Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research : And Kevin, my question was more about Q3, because I think it\u2019s still too early for Q4? Kevin Sheehan : Yes. No, I tried to cover that by saying that, our yield guidance accounts for all of that. Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research : So we are going to have a great Q3, right? Okay, I appreciate that. And I know you guys are tired. So, I will let you go. Thank you so much for all the color you have provided throughout the call. Kevin Sheehan - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, thanks everyone for your time and support. Just know that we are here working around the clock always to optimize the result and we look forward to our next quarter and we are available to answer any questions that you guys may have at any point. So \u2013 and I know you have just got a bunch of calls setup already. Thanks so much for your time. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). This conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I am joined today by Kevin Sheehan, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Wendy Beck, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Kevin will begin the call with opening commentary and Wendy will follow with more detail regarding the quarter. The call will return to Kevin for some final comments after which we will open up the call for your questions. As a remainder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on our Investor Relations website at www.investor.ncl.com and will be available for replay for 30 days following today\u2019s call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2014 results was issued last night and is available on our Investor Relations website. I would also like to review information about forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP information as a part of this call. Our comments today may include statements about our expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company\u2019s actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations.

A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin Sheehan. Kevin? Kevin Sheehan : Thanks, Andrea. Hi, good morning everyone. The results for the quarter demonstrate once again our commitment to delivering disciplined, measured, orderly growth as we navigate through an environment that has remained highly promotional most notably in the Caribbean. But we\u2019ve proven time and again, we work our way through these temporary market adjustments, finding new and creative ways to attract customers to our products through brand-building and adding to our ever growing community of loyal Norwegians. We\u2019ve done this by focusing our offerings on value-add promotions and leveraging our travel partner relationships to attract new guests to our brand. Our momentum continues reporting strong net yield growth and earnings over the prior year. The second quarter of 2013 garnered higher than usual price and premiums for the first sailings surrounding the introduction of a first-in-class vessel in this case, the Norwegian Breakaway which as you remembered debuted in April of last year. While the second quarter includes the redeployment of ships to premium itineraries, we are pleased with the \u201813, \u201814 winter season that included Norwegian Breakaway\u2019s first sailings to the Bahamas from New York and Norwegian getaways to notable sailings to the Eastern Caribbean from Miami. While our new builds attract much of the intention, our core fleet has performed well in this environment. As I stated before, with promotions attracting guests to our product is critical that we seize the opportunity to cultivate loyalty to our brand. We do that by offering an exceptional and differentiated three star cruising experience across our fleet which no other brand can duplicate. To that end in May, we announced a comprehensive $250 million investment program, with the aims of enhancing the guest experience and rolling out the latest offerings and technological advances to vessels throughout our fleet. We\u2019ve named the program Norwegian NEXT with NEXT signifying New Enhancements Experience and Transformations. The purpose of Norwegian NEXT is a distinguished project that bid a set of criteria with the ultimate goal of portraying stronger ties with our guests and strengthening brand loyalty. In other words, the projects under Norwegian NEXT umbrella are not incremental to the short and long term guidance that we have provided. They are projects that we either currently or soon to be in process will have a direct impact on what guest value in Norwegian. We remain on the cutting edge of innovation that not only provides our guests with an unmatched vacation experience but enables us to keep our fleet the most modern at sea. Norwegian NEXT crystallizes that focus with projects that were new experiences specifically tied to NEXT or by bringing best offerings from our game-changing new builds. Dining is one of the mainstays of a cruise vacation and Norwegian\u2019s Freestyle Cruising proposition offers the most choice in dining in the industry. All of our ships offer a series of complimentary dining venues along with restaurants that offer a more specially dining experience for a nominal charge. With up to 29 dining options running the gambit from All-American diners to authentic, Brazilian steakhouses to fine French restaurants and all with flexible dining times. Norwegian offers the most varied dining choices at sea. With Norwegian NEXT we are enhancing the dining experience with a comprehensive program that augments our already varied culinary offerings. As an example, we recently introduced new rotating menus to our complimentary dining venues with a greater selection of traditional and contemporary offerings that meet the discerning palates of today\u2019s discerning guests. The menus also have a strong regional focus and differ depending on itinerary. In addition, as has always been a picture of our three-star cruising proposition, exceeding in both our complimentary and specialty dining venues is only with whom you choose and never with strangers chosen by the cruise line and of course at your schedule. Not only are we extending the options to our current complimentary dining venues but we are also expanding the choice of venues by rolling out O\u2019Sheehan\u2019s Neighborhood Bar & Grill concept originally introduced on the Norwegian Epic, to the rest of the fleet. O\u2019Sheehan gives guests the option of an informal casual meal in a relaxed atmosphere. In addition as part of NEXT, we are expanding O\u2019Sheehan offering to include namely special such as the widely popular Prime Rib Night and to bring something special to the typical Bar & Grill experience. In addition the rollout of O\u2019Sheehan, we are taking other proven concepts and expanding them to balance off as the Moderno Churrascaria or Brazilian Steakhouse, which has been a hit since it was introduced on the Norwegian Epic. Lastly, our caf\u00e9s across the fleet will become instantly more popular now that they will carry treat from the popular Carlo\u2019s Bake Shop. Norwegian\u2019s bars and lounges are also unrivaled from the Bar City concept found on the Jewel-class vessels to the ice-bars of our more recent ships. As part of Norwegian NEXT we have elevated our beverage program with the help of our partners such as the Michael Mondavi family, who helped with the creation of our new fleet-wide wine menu and James Beard-nominated mixologist at Bar Lab who created our seasonal destination based cocktail menu. We\u2019re also escalating the training of bartenders, wine-stewards and restaurant managers to be better serve our increasingly educated and guests. Entertainment has always been a Norwegian hallmark highlighted by first-at-sea productions of Blue Man Group, Rock of Ages, Legally Blonde and Burn the Floor, complementing these Broadway Show will be productions from Norwegian Creative Studios, our 45,000 square-foot facility which allows us to custom tailor ever revolving collection of productions for individual ships and itineraries. We will also be expanding our Nickelodeon branded activities with new experiences for kids and Splash Academy, as well as additional opportunities for the whole family to share. Technology wise, we are expanding the reach and features of our mobile applications and rolling out innovations to make the pre-cruise and cruise experience even better. First, there is the fleet-wide rollout of iConcierge, the first app of its kind, which allows guests to preview and book shore excursions, view information on dining menus, and make reservations, review their folios and much more while onboard all from their smartphones. Second, is our cruise Norwegian app, which not only allows guests to research ships and destinations but with upcoming enhancements allows for more in-depth and robust pre cruise planning. Pre-cruise planning is also a focus of cruise coach, our newly developed booking engine that helps guests plan the right vacation. Additionally to assist guests while onboard we are expanding our digital signage throughout the ship. These touch-screens give much more than give guests information regarding the day\u2019s activities and events, they are interactive stations which allow guests to order specialty items, get directions, book reservations for dining, for entertainment and short excursions. Lastly, it\u2019s the extension of the Norwegian experience from sea to land. Norwegian was the first cruise-line to develop Private Island and to provide a private beach experience to its guests. Great Stirrup Cay has been a picture of the Norwegian cruises in the Caribbean for four decades and a recently $30 million investment and enhancement such as beach extensions, additional cabanas, the in-bars, sponsored by Bacardi and Patron not only make the beach experience that much more enjoyable for our guests. Work has also continued on Harvest Caye, our port destination in the Western Caribbean. While it\u2019s premature to reveal the island\u2019s features and offerings just yet, I can say that we are one of the most eco-friendly destinations in the cruise destination, one where guests would be encouraged to learn about the unique ecosystem of the island and its surrounding areas. In keeping with our commitment to minimize the impact on the environment, we\u2019re installing exhaust gas scrubbers on ships with heavy itineraries in the each zone as well as on all four of our new builds. In addition, all ships entering dry-docks are being treated with high performance friction reducing hull coating which lowers fuel usage and turns \u2013 and in turn cuts down emissions, one of the many fuel initiatives that we have continued to talk about and innovate with. We\u2019re excited about the expected results from the investment that comprise Norwegian NEXT and we\u2019ll be periodically keeping you apprise of our progress. We strongly believe these investments in our crew, our guest offerings and our other areas along with leveraging, learning from our most recent ships particularly Norwegian Getaway which leads our fleet and guest satisfaction, we draw our strong results into the future. Now, to go over the results for the quarter, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wendy. Wendy? Wendy Beck : Thanks Kevin, and good morning everyone. The following commentary, unless otherwise noted, compares second quarter 2014 and 2013 on an as reported basis. A 19.6% increase in capacity days coupled with 3.3% improvement in net yield resulted in an increase in revenue to $765.9 million from $644.4 million in 2013. The capacity increase was the result of a full quarter of the Norwegian Getaway along with a partial quarter of Norwegian Breakaway which entered the fleet in April 2013, partially offset by a planned drydock of Norwegian Jewel. Net yield increased 3.3% or 3% on a constant currency basis, resulting from improvements in onboard and other revenues, higher occupancy of 110.4% versus 107.5% in 2013. Fundamental changes in our cost of sales structure, so we have been working very hard to leverage our growing scale by expanding our casino partnership, renegotiating certain agreements such as our port agreements and credit card processing fees, lowering our air subsidies along with other initiatives, the benefits of which carry-forward the future period. Keep in mind that we rolled over strong comps from the second quarter of 2013 which included 3.7% increase in net tickets per diem as a result of strong pricing on the initial sailings of Norwegian Breakaway which were spurred by the strong demand surrounding the launch of a first-in-class ship. In addition, in 2013, we strategically held pricing post industry incidents. These tougher comps will start to yield in the fourth quarter. Turning to cost, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity a day decreased 2.3% or 2.7% on a constant currency basis. The decline in cost was a result of a few factors fewer drydocks in the period compared to prior year, 1 versus 1.5 in the second quarter of 2013. The absence of inaugural expenses in the quarter whereas the second quarter of 2013 contained inaugural expenses for Norwegian Breakaway and efficiencies as a result of having both Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway in our fleet coupled with continued efforts in our lean management program. Fuel expense for the quarter benefited from both lower prices and consumptions. Fuel prices per metric ton net of hedges in the quarter decreased to $622 versus $686 in 2013 whilst more consumption on a per capacity day basis decreased approximately 5% in the period. Interest expense net in the quarter was $31.9 million compared to $33.6 million in 2013 after adjusting for $70.1 million in charges related to the refinancing of certain credit facilities and the redemption of the remaining balance of certain senior unsecured notes that occurred last year. The decrease in interest expense net was a result of lower average interest rates and balances in the period due to the capital structure optimization. This decreases also particularly impressive given it includes the impact of debt associated with both the Norwegian Breakaway and the Getaway. Adjusted EBITDA increased 44% to $219.4 million from $152.3 million in 2013 while LTM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 26.7% from 24.6% in 2013. Overall we\u2019re pleased with the bottom line results for the quarter, which includes the doubling of earnings with adjusted EPS of $0.58 up from $0.29 in 2013 as a result of increased capacity days growth in net-yield, lower net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity days, lower fuel prices and lower interest expense. Looking at the full year, the promotional environment has continued and we anticipate the trend to carry-forward. The Caribbean remains the most promotional market while Europe, notably the Mediterranean continues to perform very well. Looking at the remainder of 2014, we have provided guidance along with associated sensitivities for the third quarter and full year 2014 in our earnings release. Unless otherwise noted, the following guidance metrics are on an as reported basis. It is important to keep in mind the following while reviewing guidance for the third quarter. First, third quarter provides tougher comps on a year-over-year basis as we strategically held pricing last year post industry incidents to give you an indication that ticket yield growth in Q3 2013 was 5%. Second, we anniversaried the addition of Norwegian Breakaway through our fleet with a strong pricing of her first summer season as a first-in-class ship. Going forward, the growth rate for net yields for Breakaway are expected to grow in-line with the core fleet. Lastly, our largest increase in Caribbean capacity is in third quarter. Our Caribbean capacity will account for 23% of our deployment mix up from 13% in 2013 from the addition of Norwegian Getaway sailing year-round from Miami. As a result of this, year-over-year differences coupled with the continuation of the strong promotional environment in the Caribbean, we expect an increase in net yields growth in third quarter in the range of $225 million to $275 million which is included in our full-year net yields guidance of 3% to 3.5%. Now turning to costs, we are taking advantage of the benefit of lower fuel prices to make the strategic investments which Kevin touched on earlier for the remainder of the year, an initiative that increased brand awareness and enhance the guest experience. These investments which include incremental marketing spend to help bolster demand in future quarters as well as initiatives under Norwegian NEXT result in an increase in adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel of 2% to 3%. Our adjusted EPS guidance for the quarter is $105 million to $110 million, which is approximately 25% higher than the prior year. Now, looking at the full year, as a result of the afore mentioned investments, we expect adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel to be flat to slightly up. With the benefits of these investments along with the easing of comps and lower capacity growth in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter, we are reiterating our net yield and full-year earnings guidance with net yields expected to grow in the range of 3% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS between $2.20 and $2.35. Overall, load for the remainder of the year is ahead of prior year. Our new ships continue to have a powerful impact on our earnings with both Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway garnering premiums versus our core ships in the same itineraries which is best viewed on a full-year basis. Looking at deployment for the third quarter, 23% of our capacity is in the Caribbean, 32% in Europe, 17% in Bermuda and 18% in Alaska. The balance of our deployment is in other itineraries including Hawaii. Looking to 2015, while the promotional environment has continued and we anticipate that trend to carry-forward into early 2015, we are cautiously optimistic as industry capacity growth in the Caribbean moderates to flat to slightly down for the year. Before turning the call back to Kevin, I would like to recap. Net yield growth in the quarter was up 3.3% versus prior year despite significantly tougher year-over-year comps and the continuation of the strong promotional environment. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day were down due to the impact of both new ships in our fleets as well as the timing of year-over-year expenses such as drydocks and inaugural expenses. And both fuel pricing and consumption improved, and interest expense benefited from the optimization of our capital structure. Bottom line results for the year, we are reiterating our net yield and adjusted EPS guidance. We remain focused on executing on our strategies and delivering consistent orderly earnings growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Kevin for some closing comments. Kevin Sheehan : Thanks Wendy. Before moving on, I just wanted to put some context around our perspective with respect to our net yield guidance for the coming quarters. In addition to Wendy\u2019s commentary, please keep in mind that our strategy to bring a year-round trip to Miami has always been based on a 12-month return. This includes the third quarter in which the most of last year, the majority of our fleet is in premium markets outside of the Caribbean. The new piece of the puzzle this year is the addition of Norwegian Getaway in the Caribbean. Her addition to the fleet resulted in the doubling of our Caribbean capacity for us to absorb in the third quarter. And her yields while strong, naturally dilutes the overall yield landscape giving the pricing in the peak season for our premium markets. The result is too strong, projected in the third quarter net yield increase which was always factored into a full-year outlook which would have been absent her introduction just to give you a little perspective, a little over 200 basis points higher for the third quarter. Our strategy though for bringing Norwegian Getaway to Miami has always been to demonstrate our commitment to our guests and our travel partners and is an investment in our brand and our future with the ship that has a five-year payback. Please keep that in mind. And as we move into the fourth quarter our capacity growth in the Caribbean has easier year-over-year comps and the benefits of our marketing initiatives positions us for yield growth in the fourth quarter that we have articulated here with a higher yield Norwegian Getaway in the bets. Our strategy to grow and strengthen our community of loyal Norwegians as evidenced in the investments being made onto to Norwegian NEXT program. In addition, we are making smart disciplined investments to grow our fleet. Norwegian Breakaway and Getaway have been two of the most well received vessels in Norwegian\u2019s history. They are mix of innovative public areas including the collection of restaurants and lounges that line the revolutionary open-air waterfront and the hub of activity that is 678 Ocean Place, along with an unparalleled line-up of entertainment options and activities, is a winning combination that not only makes these vessels excel in terms of guest satisfaction but in earnings power as well. We have naturally expanded these successful concepts in the design of our upcoming ships which includes the two ships announced earlier this month. The combined contract price for the 164,000 gross-ton 4,200 berth vessels is \u20ac1.6 billion with export credit financing in-place at attractive rates. Deliveries are scheduled to the spring of 2018 and the fall of 2019, 18 months apart. This latest order brings the total number of new builds on the contract with Meyer to four, with the first ship in this series, Norwegian Escape, scheduled for delivery in October of \u201815. The cost of these two new vessels is somewhat higher versus our previous orders for a variety of reasons. First, it\u2019s a simple story of supply and demand as shipyards currently have more business on the books than at the time of our previous orders which had allowed us to negotiate extremely attractive pricing, best-in-class at that time. Second, is the value of the Euro which is approximately $1.32 at the time of the prior order and as it appears to where we are today. And most importantly, the new features and enhancements of these ships which we will announce in the future also contributed to the higher costs. We believe these enhancements will continue to improve our brand positioning and expect to pay back on the 18 and 19 deliveries to be 5.5 years, modestly higher than the five years of the other new builds. Every team member at Norwegian is working hard for their respective stakeholders, be it our guests, travel agents or our shareholders to reach our ultimate goal of being the cruise line of choice with a growth rate that is unmatched in this industry. This is demonstrated in our industry-leading return on invested capital which is our IPO, we have communicated to double by the end of 2017 to 14% in addition to our previously communicated doubling of earnings per share in that same period. I thank you for your continued support. And we look forward to continue to bring you the results you have come to expect from us at Norwegian. With that, we\u2019d like to turn the call over for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sheehan. Our first question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura Group. You may begin. Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura Group : Hello and good morning. I just have a couple quick questions. First, a little clarification on ticket pricing in the second quarter, by our calculation it was down roughly 4% to 5% and my question is, is that a level that is baked into your third-quarter assumptions and if you would give us your sense of what the promotional environment looks like, vis-\u00e0-vis ticket pricing through the first quarter of \u201815? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And the excitement to me is that while we\u2019ve started to see some real traction on booking levels. And I would say for the last at least 12-weeks, we\u2019ve had substantial growth year-over-year in our booking activity, probably close to 20% or more. And what that initiative has enabled us to do as you can imagine the revenue management tools that we have, having a better loaded position and we go into the remainder of the third quarter and the fourth quarter solidly loaded above the prior year, which enables us to be more capable of moving the pricing and protecting the pricing as we get closer to the sailing. So I think we have more confidence than I\u2019ve had for a while as I look into the outlook. I think you guys know that we\u2019ve had a very unusual environment for the beginning of this year. I feel like we are, it\u2019s cautiously optimistic we\u2019re starting to feel better. We still have more to see before we can say, we\u2019ve won the whole things, the Caribbean environment, still a little bit promotional. But a little bit less in my view than what it has been, but we\u2019ll probably continue it for a while as we regurgitate the market size as been the case in other market over the years. And what happens is the consumer sees the market, the travel agents points more to the market, marketing campaigns move to the market and all of a sudden the market is right-sized. And then we have to watch-out for what\u2019s the next market that we have. This is a certainly more than what I have experienced since I came to the company as a concentration particularly with the ship that came out of nowhere from MSC, a brand new ship. But we feel now that we have a better position and we\u2019re selling our ships out consistently. So it\u2019s a good feeling. And we too feel better about our pricing. And I think the touching on the pricing and the cost of sale and we\u2019ve done some phenomenal work throughout the last, well, actually we\u2019ve always been doing it but it\u2019s more evident now when we have the two big ships and we have the other orders that we can walk into a room and negotiate some pretty solid deals. So, the run rates that you see are the run rates that we expect prospectively, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a one-time wonder. So, we feel pretty confident with that as well. Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura Group : A quick follow-up question then on the cost side. It was down per berth in the second quarter, it goes back up in the third. It looks like, based on the implied guidance for the second quarter, it actually comes down, I\u2019m sorry, for the fourth quarter, it comes down for the fourth quarter. Rarely do you see such volatility in cost per berth and what are the primary drivers behind that and how long you expect this volatility to last? Kevin Sheehan : Yes. I mean, this is a Kevin Sheehan thing, and I store the opportunity with this, when we launched the Breakaway it was a solid ship, solid results and good guest satisfaction. But when we took and suddenly changed a few things on Getaway, we launched a ship that\u2019s got phenomenal guest satisfaction. You cannot walk on that ship and not get everybody to grab you and say, I can\u2019t believe this ship and this experience. So, given some of the stuff that happened as you see the fuel is coming in, we\u2019d certainly in a different place, in the industry on our fuel cost. So it enables us to say, let\u2019s step back, we have this opportunity, let\u2019s invest in making sure that all of the learning from Getaway are pushed out to the other ships. And I got to tell you, I\u2019m very excited about it. We have a team of people that are pushing these out in every ship across the itineraries and I expect to see a nice bump in our guest satisfaction. And it\u2019s really a third quarter, it moderates quite a bit in the fourth quarter but we figured let\u2019s make sure we take advantage now or the iron is hot to get over this stuff out into the fleet. And that\u2019s kind of what you\u2019ve been hearing in our script in the earlier part of the call. Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura Group : Okay. So that really relates to the food offerings. Is there anything else that you might share with us that we as consumers would understand how it would impact our guest experience? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, it\u2019s not only the food offerings it\u2019s how we interact with the guests. We\u2019ve invested a little bit more in what we have on the ships from a human resource person that is dedicated on this ship. We\u2019ve added some trainers, we want to make sure that we are continuously reinvesting in our teams and giving them relevant timely training. And we\u2019ve just finished our survey. And one of the things that we learnt and we are in the top 25% of connects of leading companies. So that was great news. But the one area that we felt that it shows that we could learn from it is some of the over side of the crew and how do we develop them, how do we show them their career paths, how do we embrace them so some of that is training that we are undertaking right now. And also, we\u2019re putting some incremental dollars into investing in some smart marketing that we believe will be different. And you\u2019ll see some of the initiatives we\u2019ll be announcing in coming days. So, we\u2019re excited about all the prospects and the learnings and believe that this will position us, the pain inflicted on this industry over the last couple of years including what we\u2019ve seen before this year. I believe it\u2019s going to be the huge opportunity for the industry if we continue to keep our heads down, run the business smartly, the value proposition is incredibly important. And as the consumers come back and they will, you\u2019re going to see that the ability to start to navigate from a pricing standpoint. Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura Group : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. You may begin. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Hi, good morning, thanks. Wendy, you gave some very brief color on 2015 which was helpful. Thank you. I was just wondering how much visibility do have or what is the booking curve look like? I was just wondering if you could give us any more details beyond what you said in your prepared remarks. Kevin Sheehan : Do you want me to take it? Wendy Beck : Go ahead. Kevin Sheehan : So, we get a weekly \u2013 I look at pricing and I look at the booking three times a day, just so you know that in a model for everybody every single day. But as we lookout into 2015, we are better loaded at this point than we were last year and the year before. So I think that\u2019s a good situation so early in the year where we\u2019ve got another five months. And the pricing also looks encouraging. Although it\u2019s early so you hate to say, oh my god, pricing looks good. But so far, it\u2019s starting to look like we could be on the beginning of a fundamental shift. And Wendy, do you want to add anything to that or? Wendy Beck : Yes, I think we\u2019re feeling good overall about \u201815, most of the pressure we\u2019re looking at is in Q1 as we talk about with the Caribbean capacity still. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, the Caribbean capacity and you had phenomenal lease successful charter in the first quarter in the Bud Light Hotel. So, we are lapping a few of those things. So we just need to really carefully articulate the 15 quarter-by-quarter so that you guys understand how the pricing power will be in 2015, which we believe for the year would be solid. Wendy Beck : It\u2019s looking good. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: That\u2019s really helpful. Just to be clear, because I wasn\u2019t specific when you talked about being better loaded last year and the year before, we\u2019re talking about the Caribbean, right? Kevin Sheehan : That actually is across the board. So that is the comforting thing. I don\u2019t know if we took on too much with the two new ships so close together and we kind of miss \u2013 I think a little bit of what has happened is a little and I blame me, a little bit of the miss, understatement of what we needed to do. But we\u2019ve got it now, we\u2019ve got the business, we\u2019ve got the marketing and the sales, the entire organization is rallied around this bigger company. And the good comforting thing now is that as we grow in the future, we had 18 months between Getaway and the Escape. And we were 18 months between Escape and the ship after that. So, we\u2019ve allowed ourselves so much extra time to make sure we navigate through these things very carefully and having learned a little bit from taking two ships within 7 months kind of thing. And that\u2019s my fault, we had a May of 2014 delivery and then I started to get anxious about wanting to get the spring vacation and then it was President\u2019s week and then we had the opportunity to do the Bud Light Hotel. So you can understand how we pushed it up a bit. But at the end of the day that\u2019s behind us and now we\u2019ve got those learnings to help us lookout into the future. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Great. But with the Caribbean capacity kind of flattish next year for the industry and notwithstanding the challenges you have in the first quarter, would you expect the rest of the year, are you seeing improved business for the next rest of year specifically immigrating? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, I hate to say too much about it because it\u2019s a little early. But we are feeling better about the Caribbean. And the first quarter is a little bit complicated. But once you get past that the pricing looks very good for us in all of our itineraries including Caribbean. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Okay, thanks. And then I just wanted to circle back to a question that Harry was trying to get to, because, when you look at the cost savings that you guys had in the transportation onboard and other cost lines, you had done a great job, some of the cost that you have there put the company at competitive disadvantage, specifically your port fees, which you are not passing through those to the consumer so that the positive. And then, but if you adjusted those costs and you normalize them then it would have looked like your net yield were down, which I think everybody gets. But going forward I would\u2019ve thought there would\u2019ve been a bit of a tailwind to your net yield and you reiterated. So I was just wondering mathematically if you could help me through that. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, I think you have to just step back and it would be what is, the yield guidance for the next quarter is take that number and the, as what we talked about for the third quarter which is 200 basis points. So, we would have been about 4.5% had it not been, you have to look at the fleet and then add in the new ship that happens to be something as we\u2019ve said from the beginning you have to look at it on a 12-month basis. But the summer season is not the premium time for that ship in Miami to the Caribbean but over the 12 months it make upward. But in that third quarter, it pulls down our pricing in the premium itineraries because of its weight coming into the fleet. So, I would say look at it that way because you\u2019re still showing for and changed pricing in the third quarter so, if it wasn\u2019t for that entry into the market. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Okay. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. You may begin. Steve Wieczynski \u2013 Stifel: Yes, good morning guys. If I could add on to Felicia\u2019s question a little bit. So when you look at that yield in the second quarter, you have what really drove it was a little bit higher occupancy and that commission line was a good bit lower. I guess the question is going to be, it doesn\u2019t some like that was commissioned driven, it was other things and can you maybe touch on what those were and then is? With this kind of level that we saw this second quarter pretty sustainable going forward? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. And it is, we touched on hopefully is that this is sustainable things that we\u2019ve gone this is not a one off that you see as revert back in the following quarter. And the big macro thing, so some of the opportunities we\u2019ve got, because of we are gaining scale. And using that leverage and these four ships and say, you want us to be part of it. And you could have seen that with some of the stuff that we had done in the past. Without all these big new ships, Wendy, maybe take him through a little bit more specifically. Wendy Beck : Sure. We have very aggressively gone after all of our port agreements and looks at it with more of a worldwide land. And combining all of the services in the port and looking at how can, we lower those costs. And then, in turn pass those on to our consumers. Kevin Sheehan : By the way, we hired the guys that we\u2019re in the Port of New York, and he\u2019s an excellent hire. He was offered positions with several other companies but wanted to come work with us. But he\u2019s been a very big plus for us because he knows the nuances. He knows all the relationships throughout the entire court. And he\u2019s been a very, very good hire for us. Wendy Beck : I also would add that we\u2019ve continued to expand our casino players by expanding different channels. Those are typically lower cost channels for us but it gives the customer the opportunity to upgrade their cabins which, puts more revenue up in the top line with little to know cost of sale. So we benefited from that and expanded relationships. The other thing that I had touched on in my commentary was the fact that we did a lot of air packages in the prior year. And we have moved away from doing the air packages in 2014. And credit card processing that\u2019s the other one is we aggressively went and renegotiated our credit card agreement which was way overdue which also benefits our costs of sales line. Kevin Sheehan : So, if you go back in time, when we first came in here, our credit card agreement was very expensive and it was naturally expensive because of the size of the business and the history of the business. And they also had financial holds on our cash because of the situation of the company. So, we\u2019ve evolved from that case to a case where we now can drive to the best pricing by going to other players who say, this is a first class organization, do you want our business. So, we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of that as well. I hate to get into too much of this detail, because as you know, it becomes fodder for everybody else in the industry. Steve Wieczynski \u2013 Stifel: Okay, got you. And then, second question, Kevin, and I\u2019m not sure what you can say or can\u2019t say, but you bought back from some stock in the quarter and that was a little bit unexpected. I guess, so early but you still have these two largest shareholders still own 35% or 40% of the company and there really hasn\u2019t been much of an update in terms of what they potentially will do over time and I think that\u2019s something continues to lean on your stock. Is there anything that you can help us maybe try to put a little bit more clarity on that at this point? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, sure. And remember when we announced the program we did say was we had two pronged approach, one was to take out inventory in the market, when we thought it was opportunistic. And the other was if there was a selling event that we could piggyback on that so that we weren\u2019t leading it and we were giving them ability. But if they were doing it, we could just kind of comment last minute and piggyback. So hopefully that\u2019s still the case. Now the thing is, the stock performance these guys are, they know where the business is going and so they\u2019re saying we\u2019re not going to sell at these levels, which is unfortunate in one respect because that keeps that consequence of not knowing when they\u2019re selling out there. But there are proponents of the business in the future of our organization. So there, I can\u2019t get a clear answer from anybody of course. But each player, you saw it even with TPG, they didn\u2019t even sell in the last time that we did have an offering because they weren\u2019t happy with the stock price. So, I think what you will see is, over time when the stock will take care of itself over time because of the power of our earnings and our management team, of course we\u2019re frustrated with the stock price but we\u2019re in this for the long-term, I\u2019ve never even thought about selling the share at these levels personally ominous to drive the value that I know it\u2019s coming in, in the out years. So, it\u2019s a frustration to the stock prices the way that we can\u2019t control that. We\u2019re doing our best to deliver on our results. We hope that people will, as they\u2019re public now is almost 50% of the shareholder base. But that at some point, three different players become just big holders in everybody\u2019s view. And I wish I could tell you more and you never are going to get a clear answer from any of them, which is of course logical. Steve Wieczynski \u2013 Stifel: Right. Okay. Thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robin Farley of UBS. You may begin. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: Great. I wonder if you could give us the rough air-sea mix in Q2 versus the prior year. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, no, we\u2019re not going to provide that detail. That would be very proprietary. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: Okay. And then I think your opening comments you mentioned\u2026 Kevin Sheehan : We could give you some, maybe what we could do is give you some dollar change or something, I mean, I don\u2019t want to not be responsive but we don\u2019t want to get too clear since we only are one brand as you know. So, after the call we can give you a little bit of color. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: I mean, is not something that\u2019s been, a lot of things in the company there hasn\u2019t been a huge fluctuation air-sea mix. I remember a couple of years ago it used to actually be talked about pretty openly because since it\u2019s really more of a pass through for the operators it\u2019s not something you normally try to yield manage, I guess, but? Kevin Sheehan : But at certain times, in Hawaii as an example when air cost and we can go and negotiate air cost that we may try to do a bigger percentage of our business through that program. So this nuance is that it happens depending on the outlook. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: Okay. And then just you commented on the volume in the last 12 weeks being up 20% and I wonder if you can comment at all on what pricing has been in this period in the last two weeks? In other words, you mentioned that the Caribbean has been promotional so perhaps the volume is been driven by that but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any color on pricing? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, I mean, one thing I could tell you is, the guys have been moving the pricing, especially wherever the sailings look like they are being sold at a reasonable pace. The one thing I could do is mandate and we\u2019ll see how this works. We of course, if we have to we\u2019ll roll it back. But I two weeks ago mandated a 3% price increase on every sale and on every ship on meadow. And so it\u2019s been rolling for a couple of weeks. We\u2019re still seeing good volumes. So I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to keep that into the market and then continue to navigate. We just need to start to take conviction in our product and move our pricing. And I can fight with the revenue management guys forever but at some point you have to say guys, let\u2019s do it and let\u2019s believe in ourselves and let\u2019s see what happens. And that\u2019s where we are right now. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: Great. And then lastly if you could comment, sort of characterize a little bit Europe and Alaska in Q3? I know some others have said Europe, European yields are up double digits in Q3 but not everybody is saying that so I don\u2019t know where you come out on that. Thanks. Wendy Beck : So, for Alaska this year, our most robust market obviously has been Europe and that\u2019s the one that I touched on. But Alaska is doing well. This is the second year that we had the three ships in there the Sun being the newest one, looks significantly better than it did, it\u2019s first year noble year last year and to Alaska. But overall we\u2019re pleased with how Alaska has shaped up this year. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: And can you put any kind of quantification around Europe in terms of the increase, just like a ballpark? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, I think in the second quarter it\u2019s double-digit I think. When you look across the four ships that we have in Europe in the third quarter the pricing is up above 10%. And remember I know everybody is talking about this like its Nirvana but this is also a horrible 2013 for the industry as everybody knows. So it\u2019s a recovery, to me it\u2019s a big opportunity and \u201815 if the world starts to get a little bit more normalized. Wendy Beck : Yes, the thing that I would add there is that we\u2019re one of the cruise lines that actually has two ships year round. So we also benefit from that in Q4 with significant pricing and load increases on rigorous selling. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo : Thank you, just a couple here. Regarding, it\u2019s been talked about before and in the past the premiums that you\u2019re getting the degree thereof on Breakaway and Getaway versus the rest of the fleet in the Caribbean. This is backward looking, obviously, but could we anticipate some of that narrowing that we\u2019ve seen of late be due to base loading and now, Kevin, as you just alluded to you\u2019re trying to be a little bit more proactive in trying to take the price that you believe you deserve. Should we interpret part of that in that direction looking into the first, in first quarter? Kevin Sheehan : I\u2019m not sure I followed the question. But as far as the premiums on the two new ships as well as Epic, when you look at them across the 12 months and do the 12 months of pricing and compare it to another ship in that itinerary it drives a double-digit premium. The only caveat I would have on that is the couple of the sailings we\u2019re \u2013 worst of the time in the second quarter where you had to put on people with a little bit less price then you had a little bit less of a comprise on your onboard experience because as you could imagine, if it\u2019s a bigger ticket item to a family they\u2019re not going to spend as much onboard. So I think the check the box we got through the onboard the second quarter fine but I could see a little bit of that. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for us to make sure we\u2019re bringing in the right guests on the right ships at the right time to ensure that the other part of the proposition is onboard revenue continues to drive the double-digit premium as well as across the 12 months. Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay. And then in relation to your statement there, is, and we\u2019ve got a positive convergence coming up here with the Caribbean capacity for yourselves in the industry, the increase is lessening and actually declining as we get into the third quarter of next year. So that\u2019s all good and has positive implications for price. But could the recovery here for yourselves, Carnival, other folks, who are having to do with that little bit more challenged customer, could that be elongated? Because if you attracted a consumer who came and then maybe was not able to spend onboard, that consumer probably doesn\u2019t repeat next year or maybe even two years out. Does that leave a little bit of a hole that you have to fill that you may be filled in the industry, filled on a 1 to 3 year basis in \u201814 here with the aggressive pricing? Kevin Sheehan : No, I think it is, it\u2019s a whole litany of things that happened between now and as you get out to the second half of next year, with economic indicators and people are completely forgotten all of this noise in the industry back to looking at this is a phenomenal vacation experience. And the useful statistics about April who were reluctant to take a cruise because of all the noise, and that \u2013 the consumer\u2019s memory is very short and we are very hopeful that as we get out into next year and we continue to showcase the proposition that we have in the other grants as well that we as a unified \u2013 not sure unified but as a complete industry, I believe we have the opportunity to start to move back into the pricing categories that we should be at. And we didn\u2019t have this year because of this shock to the system in the Caribbean. Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, okay. And then if I may, lastly, regarding a little bit longer-term outlook with the order of the two additional Breakaway plus ships, any thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about Asia over the next couple of years given what some competitors have done and the opportunity in that market over the next couple of years with your capacity coming and then maybe does it have any implications for some of your older ships also? Kevin Sheehan : Yes. So, we\u2019re going to continue to watch that very carefully to be honest. And it gets back to the same thing with the number of ships we have and we compete with brands that have so many ships than us that we still are able to stay in itineraries that we feel comfortable with and have a better control over the outcome and knowing with certainty that we can drive the measured orderly growth. Having said that, we are looking at a ship at some point that\u2019s going to go over say, maybe period of time in Australia, New Zealand kind of thing. But will then it continue to navigate that and when we announce it, it\u2019s probably not going to come with the next itinerary announcement but they are after. We probably want to be sure that when we look at that we know what the right asset is because I think that is an important point is the old days you would put an older asset over there is that going to make it work, that\u2019s as market gets more interesting they may be looking for more interesting ships. So, we\u2019ll continue to monitor that very carefully and as we always said, when we go over to that market we have a lot of bandwidth already with the sailing efforts that we have in place today with the training centers that we have in Asia and all the rest of it. So, we know we can walk in and be pretty comfortable with our success. But it still looks like the opportunities that we have here are more certain. So, I guess that\u2019s what I would say about that. Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo : That\u2019s fair. Thank you, sir. Kevin Sheehan : Thank you. And we have time for one more question operator. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning. Just a question on how the board is thinking about capital allocation. You answered it a little bit on share buyback and also the potential for an offering. But the reason I ask is, Kevin, you just said yourself that the shares were undervalued. They look very cheap et cetera. And then you also said earlier that ships are turning out to be a little bit more expensive, although you did decide to build them. I\u2019m trying to decide or understand how the board is balancing all of this. And if I could throw one more in which is selling a ship or two, here or there, how does the board and you think about all those different factors at this time? Kevin Sheehan : Sure. Steven, we long enough to know that we\u2019re always thinking about capital allocation and how do we optimize what we can do for our shareholders. And we are constantly looking to make sure we\u2019ve got the right balance in each of the buckets. As far as selling an older ship, we don\u2019t have any old ships. So we\u2019re different than the other companies in that. Our average age is so much less than the other guys. And when you look at the ships that are the oldest in our fleet, which are 12 or 13 years old, they work perfectly in the itinerary that we have them if you take as an example, our three and four-day Miami ship, it\u2019s the youngest ship by far in the market. It competes very effectively. To people who take that experience love it. It\u2019s a typical, people get on a Friday, you have a party weekend, get off on Monday morning and then we expose families that are in many cases first time cruisers to our products. So that ship works really well there. So, and that\u2019s our oldest ship. So you get into the thing of saying okay, what would you sell. And then, there are brokers that have been talking to us as you would expect saying, hey, what about this ship. So, we have attractive ships for people and then the question is, do you want to \u2013 do you want to dispose that ship as we are so much older than the other guys. And then what happens, as you do the mathematics, and you look at the returns that we drive are no ships then the sky is the perfect example. The ticking yield is a little lower. But it is so much more efficient because of the fuel, it\u2019s almost like you go out away from people being able to see where land is. And you kind of stick around in that area, and you don\u2019t have a big shovel on the ship, so you don\u2019t have that big entertainment expense. It\u2019s just behaves as a party kind of vacation experience and people are running around on those short cruises and they don\u2019t want to spend their evening in the theater. So, there are many reasons why on a return basis as the ships sound smart. So, that\u2019s kind of what have been the push-back for me as these guys come to us and look at our ships and want to think about us selling them. So, we will keep it on the in our view but we want to be smart too because we want to drive EPS. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Kevin Sheehan : And I really thank everyone for your time and support. We really look forward to next quarter give you another chance to see how we operate through this environment. We\u2019re always available if anybody has any questions, feel free to call Andrea, Wendy or myself. And thanks for your time this morning. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Sheehan. Mr. Sheehan, you may proceed. Kevin Sheehan : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Well, it's been a busy couple of months here at Norwegian and as you know, we've recently announced an agreement to acquire Prestige Cruises, parent company of Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas. Teams from both companies have been working diligently on integrating the two organizations to set an optimal organization. I'll take you through in a little bit, that will facilitate knowledge sharing and decision making, while ensuring that we identify opportunities to leverage each brands, strengths. Under one organization, the combination of Norwegian, Oceania and Regent brands will result in a unique cruise operator with a portfolio brands that cover every key segment in the cruise industry. Norwegian offers the freedom and flexibility of a resort style vacation onboard, some of the most innovative ships in the industry. Oceania offers an upper premium experience with unparallel culinary offerings on its fleet of mid-size ships and Regent offers the ultimate all inclusive luxury cruise experience. In addition, to working on this important integration. The team at Norwegian did not lose focus on what's important and that is delivering exceptional cruise vacations to our guests. Over 500,000 of them in fact, this alone from Copenhagen to [indiscernible] to Miami to Mykonos. Norwegian welcomed more passengers this quarter than at any time in our 47-year history. This growth will only continue as we look forward to delivery of the Norwegian Escape and the rest of our Breakaway class ships in coming years. In the quarter, we continued with our successful four ships deployment in Europe and for the first summer on over a decade. Norwegian offered a seven day Caribbean cruise to Miami onboard our newest ship Norwegian Getaway. This quarter, not only marks a record milestone in terms of passengers carried and return to summer cruising in the Caribbean. It also marks our 25th consecutive quarter of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA growth. The result during that time is a 23% compounded annual growth rate and adjusted EBITDA and an expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin by 1,600 basis points, but we are nowhere near our goal line. With many critical initiatives, that we must and will execute on to continue our momentum. So I brought in some additional firepower to take Norwegian's to the next level. A couple weeks ago, we welcomed Drew Madsen to the Norwegian team. Drew joins us as President and Chief Operating Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line focusing on the company's core day-to-day business. After a long search for a proven leader to add to our already accomplished and diversified management team. Drew's strong track record of success, with more than 30 years of leadership experience in the hospitality and consumer products industry makes him the perfect addition. Marking another milestone in our company. We celebrated the keel laying of Norwegian Escape which marks the beginning of construction of our largest ship to-date and the first and the four ships Breakaway plus class fleet. At 4,200 berths, she will be the largest ship to homeport year around in Miami offering seven day cruises beginning in November, 2015. Norwegian Escape with both proven features from our Breakaway class ships along with new and unique elements. These proven features include the waterfront and six, seven, eight ocean place our game changing innovative designs first introduced on Norwegian Breakaway. This concept includes an ocean front boardwalk line with restaurants, bars and shops combined with three expansive flowing decks of dining, bars, entertainment, gaming and more. Along with these two popular spaces, a number of new venues and interactive experiences will be announced in coming months leading up to her delivery. These are just a few of the many highlights in the quarter. Before turning the call over to Wendy, I'd like to touch on a topic that would remiss, in not addressing here. The entire industry to clear [ph] has set protocols with respect to Ebola across our fleets and also part of the embarkation process. We have seen an impact on the margin over the last several weeks. However, booking levels have moved back to pre-news levels over the last couple of days and barring additional sensationalism by the news media or a major outbreak, we anticipate that this will be old news going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Wendy who'll go over our financial results for the quarter. Wendy? Wendy Beck : Thanks, Kevin and good morning, everyone. The following commentary unless otherwise noted compares third quarter 2014 and 2013, on an as reported basis. A 13.1% increase in capacity days coupled with a 3% improvement in net yield resulted in an increase in revenue to $907 million from $797.9 million, in 2013. The capacity increase was the result of full quarter of sailings from Norwegian Getaway in her first summer of season of seven day voyages in the Caribbean. For addition of the fleet and year round deployment out of Miami resulted in our increased in our third quarter Caribbean deployment to 23% from 13% in 2013. The 3% improvement in net yield was the result of higher net ticket, onboard and other revenue along with ongoing margin improvement initiatives. This yield improvement is even more impressive considering the strong comps; we are rolling over from the third quarter, 2013. These comps included to 3.7% increase in net tickets per diems, which were augmented by the strong demand in pricing associated with the launch of first in class ship in this case, Norwegian Breakaway, which sails her inaugural summer season in Bermuda at this time, last year. In addition to the benefit of Norwegian Breakaway strong pricing, we also strategically held pricing through the third quarter following the industry incidence, which occurred earlier in 2013. Lastly, net yield experienced a benefit from foreign exchange rates in the period, which on a full result basis impacted adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02. Going forward, we expect foreign exchange to inversely impact the fourth quarter of approximately the same amount. Now turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity a day increased 2.6% or 2.2% on a constant currency basis. The increase was a result of the strategic investments we have made to enhance the guest experience, by our initiatives under the Norwegian NEXT program. Kevin described these initiatives on our last earnings call, an additional information regarding Norwegian NEXT can be found on our website at www.ncl.com/next. Also consistent with last quarter, we made incremental investments in marketing to bolster demand in future quarters. Fuel expense for the quarter benefited from lower prices in the quarter. Decreasing 7.8% to $641 per metric ton net of hedges versus $695 in 2013. Looking below the line an increase in interest expense, net in the quarter to $32.3 million from $26.6 million in 2013 was the result of higher average interest rates and balances in the period. Regarding taxes, while we reported income tax expense in the period of $2.5 million compared to $7.9 million in 2013. The 2014 period included $2.7 million benefit as a result of true-up following the filing of the company's 2013 tax returns. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased 20.5% to $326.7 million from $271 million in 2013. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA increased to $809.5 million, while the associated margin improved to 27.6%. As Kevin mentioned earlier, this marks our 25th consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA growth, which translates into a compounded annual growth rate of 23%. We are pleased with the bottom line results for the quarter, which includes in almost 30% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.11 up from $0.86 in 2013 as a result of capacity growth from the addition of Norwegian Getaway. Growth in that yield from both ticket, and onboard, and lower fuel prices offset by continued investments and initiatives related to Norwegian NEXT. Looking at the remainder of 2014, we have provided guidance along with associated sensitivities for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 in our earnings release. This guidance excludes the impact from the acquisition of Prestige Cruises which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect the increase in net yield in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 3.5% to 4% on an as reported basis and 4% to 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Turning to cost, we expect adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day to be flat to down slightly on an as reported basis and flat to up slightly, on a constant currency basis. This guidance includes the rescheduling of the drydock of Norwegian Gem from the fourth quarter of this year, to 2015. The drydock was originally scheduled earlier than required primarily to carry out projects related to Norwegian NEXT such as adding the popular O'Sheehan's Bar & Grill and relocating Moderno Churrascaria to a new more prominent location adjacent to Cagney's Steakhouse. In addition, work is underway for the installation of the ships exhaust gas scrubbers. Thanks to the hard work and planning by our technical and hotel operations team. These projects which are critical to elevating the guest experience and delivering on the Norwegian NEXT promise will not have to wait for the ship to be drydocked and are instead being carried out, while the ship is in service. We will however, have a number of staterooms out of service, but we are continued on these and other initiatives. Offsetting the expense savings from the drydock rescheduling, our continued investments in marketing and initiatives surrounding the Norwegian NEXT program. Now moving to the bottom line, our adjusted EPS guidance for the quarter is in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. Looking at the full year, we have narrowed the range of net yield to 3.2% to 3.3% on both and as reported and constant currency basis. We expect adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day, to be flat to be up slightly both on as reported and constant currency basis. For adjusted EPS, we are narrowing guidance to $2.28 to $2.32 raising the midpoint of previous guidance by $0.025 for the year. Looking at deployment for the fourth quarter, 59% of our capacity is in the Caribbean as Norwegian Getaway marks her first fall in Miami, 17% in Europe, 6% in Hawaii and 3% in Bermuda. The balance of our deployment is in other itineraries. While the closing of the acquisition of Prestige Cruises is expected to occur prior to year end, thus allowing us to commence 2015 as a combined company. We wanted to get some color on the outlook for the year at least from the Norwegian brand perspective. We are looking to a normalized 2015, whereby industry capacity growth in the Caribbean moderates and is expected to be slightly down for the year. While we are lapping the introduction of Norwegian Getaway, which joined the fleet in January, 2014 and welcoming Norwegian Escape to our year round deployment in mid-November 2015. The combined impact of these results is less than a quarter resulting a more organic 2015. Giving some color into the first quarter of 2015. We are expecting to offer comparison on a net yield basis at the results of a few items in the first quarter, 2014. We saw solid net yield improvements of 3.8%. The quarter included two unique high yield dock side charters. Norwegian Jade for the Sochi Olympics, which was under chartered for almost half of the quarter and Norwegian Getaway for the Bud Light Hotel, associated with the Super Bowl in New York. In addition, we strategically help pricing and sacrifice load as we entered the wave season. And lastly in 2014, we experienced a healthy year-over-year increase in the volume of charter from our Sixthman charter business. However in 2015, the volume will be consistent with 2014. Before turning the call back to Kevin, I would like to recap our results for the quarter. Net yields growth in the quarter was up 3% versus prior year, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased due to strategic investments ended enhancing the guest experience. Fuel pricing improved, while interest expense increase due to higher rates in overall borrowings and the bottom line result was 29% increase in adjusted EPS. We succeeded our guidance for the quarter, with that I'll turn over the call to Kevin for some closing comments. Kevin? Kevin Sheehan : Thanks, Wendy and as I mentioned in my opening comments. We remain on track to close the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International and are hard at work on our integration plans to establish the industry leading diversified cruise operator. We currently anticipate closing the transaction in mid-November. To-date, we have taken the following steps in the process to close the transaction. First, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust clearance. Next on October 16, we received clearance for the SEC information statement providing shareholders 20 days\u2019 notice regarding the pending transaction. We've also received approval from SACE, Italy's Export Credit Agency to assume the debt related to Oceania's two most recent ships along with the 2016 Regent delivery. In addition, we held successful meetings with banks and also with the rating agencies in anticipation of a notes offering, which will be marketed in the very near future. The Prestige and Norwegian team are working together to integrate two organizations in a very thoughtful way. The organization structure which I think will be the blueprint for the industry, we include Drew Madsen running Norwegian and Regent and Oceania, with Frank Delrio at the helm, as Chief Executive Officer, with Kunal Kamlani continuing running the day-to-day business as President and Chief Operating Officer. In addition to the two President, Wendy along with new build, and a few others areas will report to directly to me. Also, reporting to me will be Jason Montague, the current Chief Financial Officer of Prestige, who will Head the integration full-time. This is important to me, as we are also matrixing four areas shipboard operations, human talent both shoreside and ship side, passenger services and destination services. This structure is poised to realize significant additional synergies over the coming years, as we continue to carefully employee best practices to position our business for long-term success, always looking to enhance the guest experience, as we move forward. As a result of the projected timing of the transaction closing, we expect our next call to review fourth quarter and full year results to be the first as a combined entity. Following reporting our year end results, we will host an Investor Day in early February to provide additional information on a new combined entity, and provide 2015 forward-looking commentary. This will allow our leaders time to trench themselves in their new roles, focus on the integration of the combined organization and provide more clarity on 2015. One other point for each quarter through 2015, we will detail the key metrics for Norwegian and Prestige and 2016 and thereafter, we will report on a consolidated basis, consistent with our industry peers. This is an extremely exciting time at Norwegian and we look forward to bringing you another report of solid results next quarter. Again anticipating completing the year, with an increase of over 60%, as well as more than a double in the two-year period, since we went public. Thank you for your continued support. We would like to go ahead and open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sheehan. (Operator Instructions) our first question is from Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup. You may begin. Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup: Great, thanks. Could you give us a little bit of color on the Caribbean versus Europe in terms of maybe how you think the net yields are progressing for 2015? Obviously, 2014 was a little bit tough on the Caribbean. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, that's a great point. As we look at it, actually the fourth quarter is pretty well set, so let's focus on the theme. On 2015, the thing that we've done, I think that was a very smart move. Is we are significantly more loaded on the Getaway and the Epic and the Breakaway is also more loaded for the first quarter, which I think will enable us to be in a stronger position as we go through the wave season to continue to optimize the pricing, as we get through that quarter. And for all the Caribbean market for our company. We are well ahead in every quarter for 2015. So I think that's all good news and then on the pricing side and I think you got to take this a little bit into perspective and you heard this before from the other players. The first quarter is a little bit of stilled the growth, but it's a little bit not a big year-over-year growth, but I think it's under 1% for the industry growing to 53% from 52.2%, but what happens in the second quarter, and the third quarter, and fourth quarter is that contracts there's actually an improvement from the prior year, so that should bode well as well. So the European market continues to work consistent with what it has happened in the prior year, but the first quarter is going to be a little bit. I think, when we touched on it, we had a phenomenally successful charter in, if for the Olympics in Sochi and it was significantly above what that ship would have done, had it stayed in the market, in the worst part of the year as you know, that's the weakest part of the year. So we were able to improve our yields in that first quarter, because of that, so we'll be laughing that as well as the Bud Light Hotel. As we see it today, if the booking patterns play out as we expect, we believe the first quarter will be close to positive maybe a 0.1% up or so and then it gets much better as you get past the first quarter. So the first quarter along with the industry is the one, where we are all focused on, but things seem to look, like they're really improving as you get past that first quarter. Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup:  Yes, it's great color. Kevin and just another separate question, if I could? When you announced the acquisition, I think you had a page of different synergies that you could achieve which was greater than the $25 million, has that page turned into two pages or have you cut that down, a half a page. Kevin Sheehan : Not that, I'm going to tell you today. So I would say the thing, I was \u2013 and I have been told to contain my enthusiasm, because we haven't closed yet. The synergy number that we communicated on the announcement, is I would say in the bag, having the organization set up the way, we are, I think we have enormous opportunities and is going to be something that well the opportunity is not only, that we'll realize on day one, but as you know with Jason and I working full time on this. We are going to be getting into each and every area, making sure we've got best practices and of course a best proposition to our guest, and the travel agents to make sure, they see that this is a business that's on the run from an improvement and guest scores for all three brands. So we're really excited about it, but the punch line I think is that we'll be hopefully benefit, but I don't want to get too far into it, and that will come out quickly in 2015, but it's going to be the nice thing about this is, in addition to [indiscernible] and management initiatives that we are still working on the Norwegian side, that will have opportunities on the Prestige side. These margin opportunities will be a runway for three years, four years, five years because you want to be careful, as you do this to always make sure that the guest, thinks we are improving the proposition as oppose to anything else. Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup:  Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. You may begin. Steve Wieczynski \u2013 Stifel: Good morning, guys. So Kevin, I know you talked before about your margins and the margin improvement there has been pretty impressive but, as you kind of dig in, a little more with Prestige and I think, you just address this a little bit, but how much more upside you think there is, going forward in terms of year, your margin structure overtime. Kevin Sheehan : You know, it's funny when we talked about this. Most probably less than 18 months ago, I think we were about 25%, we said we were going to be up 500 basis points and now we are half way, there. I think at the industry phase in a reasonable place and hopefully, the economic stuff starts to get a little, it's never going to be a big huge positive economic rebound, but if it's on the margin, a little bit better, employment has gotten significantly better, interest rates remain well. If that starts to catch up with the consumer spending, we believe that there is an enormous. I don't want to, maybe Wendy will kill me, but there's probably another 500 basis points and you know when we look at our model, if we, we're not looking at aggressive stuff and I think you guys have all built models, you know two to three or whatever each individual firm has used for pricing and onboard revenue and just doing, what we've done for 6.5 years and continuing in that momentum. I think there's an enormous opportunity and then on top of that, the opportunities of putting three great brands together smartly will enable us to have a nice benefits. So yes, we have a little bit of work to do, to make sure when we consolidate that we continue on our journey, but I believe that we have that opportunity without getting too much into it. So it's all good. Steve Wieczynski \u2013 Stifel: Okay, great and then second question, with Prestige. It's basically going to be a two-part question, but you talked about Norwegian in terms of what you're seeing so far in 2015, can you give us maybe high level color, what you're seeing with Prestige and then on the synergy side, I know you said, you're not going to give us an updated number, but as you kind of dig a little bit more to Prestige. If there is upside to that $25 million synergy target, what area do you see the most, what area do you see the most upside or potential upside coming from? Kevin Sheehan :  Well, I think we're being very, very careful in integrating these brands. We have three great brands that are doing phenomenally well in the market. So we have to be very thoughtful and careful, and if there's, I think we alluded to last time, that when you go to all the 100 supports that the three brands go to, and having a little bit more fire power. I actually had dinner with the Premier of Bermuda on Thursday night, what is today. Tuesday, couple days ago. I have no life, by the way. So we had dinner and of course, his interest level is more excited because he's saying, oh! my god. You've got these other two great brands and the ship can get into Hamilton. So I'm telling you, we are going to engage and optimize every one of these opportunities. Bermuda is a magnificent location and as you know, the big ships go into dockyards at one end of the island, and there was the other end, that we used to go into the smaller ships. So we are looking for ideas, of how to improve on that experience with being able to make, like we used to do with the smaller ships start on one side of the island and then we would move to the other side. So with these two additional brands, we certainly have his attention and he wants to make sure, we are aligned on our success going forward. So he's a brand new Premier, fourth one actually I'm embarrassed to say, since I joined the company seven years ago, but this guy is a career politician and I think he's got, he understands the mathematics behind it, that's just one example. Support opportunities are there, we've got destination services, as you saw there's a separate service. All of the work we do, in Shore Excursions getting best execution on the cost side. it never hurts to go around with a new organization scale and hey, say, look this is the price that we had and now. So we see the opportunities there, we see lots of opportunities on the fuel side. lots of work that we've been doing, you guys have heard, all of the great work that we've done over the last number of years. We expect to be able to benefit some of that on the Prestige side, but also continuing as we're learning on these new ships. So back to the original question. How do we seek 2015? So they're booked solidly for 2015 and their revenue is up significantly for 2015. I do want to say, they're feeling a little bit of the same stuff in the first quarter. So the first quarter is the journey for all of us, in the industry and then once, we get past there. The rest of the year, looks pretty darn good. Steve Wieczynski \u2013 Stifel:  Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Appreciated. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura. You may begin. Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe if could just take a step back and Kevin, you can give us a bit of history behind, why is that coming together of these companies make sense and versus this transaction not happening one or two years ago. What were the challenges then? Kevin Sheehan : That's great question, Harry and I think, I alluded to it. This is been a long, long process for me. I started this conversation four years ago, with one of the founder guys from Apollo. We both walked away, saying oh! my god, this makes so much, get it done. And that was the, without getting into the noise of all the different owners and where the funds were invested and on and on. So it just turned out, that it was much more complicated thing at that time and here we were launching between Epic and Breakaway and taking the company, so we were distracted, with all these other exciting initiatives and so running continuously towards, where we are reporting today. When the S-1 went out for Prestige, I saw that as an opportunity to restart that conversation and I actually had talked to Frank Delrio over the last couple of years, a few times and we both kind of say, hey, doesn't this make an awful lot of sense. We just never got past that, until the S-1 was filed and when it was filed, I put together a proposition and I have to tell you, it wasn't, it was very clear from the strategic standpoint and all the rest of it, but you never know, what different partners, what their separate strategies are long or short-term with our stock. So as I expected, it was complicated process, at the end of the day, all of our board members were really excited, when we showed them the opportunities for transaction. So it's just because so compelling, when you look at the ability for us to have more scale and as you know, we've done a terrific in on the scale side of the business, and we will continue to do that, but it also gave us opportunities to be in different segments to the market, but also learnings that we can now really dig into and you look at Prestige and what a phenomenal job they've done on yields and then you say, what about Pride of America. You've got this unique experience in Hawaii that nobody competes with us, at all, and why can't we adopt a better marketing program, more like what they do. I think that's a big opportunity and then, another one of the big opportunities is, on the Haven and just looking at the Haven and what we see, in the Haven is our very successful guests. Usually are on with extended families kids and grandkids and they stay up in the Haven, that's where the family maybe in other parts of the ship and it's a wonderful experience, because those multi-generational groups can then go into, the kids can go into Nickelodeon and the teenagers go on the rope courses and the water parks and everybody can get together in a wonderful restaurants that we have. So this unique experience that we can provide for that affluent guest. So here we are now, with both, we're all excited about that and the opportunity that we can realize from taking our database on both sides and saying, how do we do a better job, of driving the guest to the right proposition because the same thing holds true for our Haven person that may not aware of the other proposition and introducing them to Oceania and Regent. To me, the cost stuff, that's going to happen. Where this is exciting is us learning and being intellectual about how we optimize the revenue. The multiples of the stocks in general as you know, are all driven by the top line and we are so focused on that and of course, you've seen what we've done for 6.5 years or whatever. We're taking this brand and bringing it to the prominence it is today, even before the transaction. so we are very excited, about what the opportunities with the three companies, put together. Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura:  Thanks, Kevin. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is from Robin Farley of UBS. You may begin. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: Great, thanks. I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. I know you talked a lot about sort of qualitatively the outlook next year. But it sounded like you said, actually up 1% for yield in Q1, I just want to make sure, I understood that correctly. What are you expecting in guidance and then? Was there any sort of range quantitatively to think about yield for next year after Q1?  You said, it sounded like you said, better than the 1% growth. Kevin Sheehan : Oh! yes, it's too early to get too far into the numbers. As you could imagine, while we're still in the budget process, but the yield numbers out. I'm looking after the full year and this isn't, I mean I may have to go back and push back to anybody that came in a level that was very comfortable to me, relative to the model. So I could say that and that skewed a little bit because at the first quarter, as you said, if the booking patterns continue the way we see it. We can finish the year, with a positive 1%, but that's a huge, I got to tell you, given the market dynamics in the first quarter and the fact, that we have Sochi and the Bud Light Hotel in the first quarter, that's a phenomenal result because it was a huge, huge number from the Sochi incremental amount. So to give you a little bit of color on that and as Wendy mentioned on the conference call, just one other thing. Remember, it is really on as an organic year, other than on the margin, right. So the Getaway you're going to have four sailings to six sailings into the beginning of the year and Escape by the time it gets into a service. It is just four sailings to six sailings in the back end of the year. So it's, I think it will be a testament of us, as an organization. How we operate in an organic environment? We did this in other years and prove ourselves, where we were able to drive very good yields and we are up to the task again. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS:  Okay, great and then, I wonder just to quantify a couple other things, the items. Wendy, maybe this is in wheelhouse, but how much did shifting the drydock out of Q4, how much does that help expense non fuel expense per unit or maybe an EPS, whatever is you know the way to think about, how that helped, is helped in Q4? And then, can you quantify how much, the charters, what the charters contributed to your Q1 yield growth last year and earlier this year to sort of think about, what you're comping against with that? And then just last thing, if I could throw it in there, there have been some interesting sort of dynamic in the last two quarters, with your growth yield in and your net yields. Is that kind of the yield guidance for Q4 and into Q1? Should we think about that and maybe a similar thing where maybe more of the net yield growth, is coming from the netting against growth, where you know gross yield wouldn't be up, but it would be the change in commissions? Wendy Beck :  Okay, so first off regarding the benefit of deferring the Gem drydock. It's about $2 million, $3 million benefit net of all the work that we are doing, in addition to taking the cabins out of service to get all of the Norwegian NEXT programs done well, while the ship is running. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, so remember, we took the ship. It wasn't due for drydock for more than a 1 year and we got so anxious to get the O'Sheehan Pub and Churrascaria situated in the right areas and all of that. So that's why we set the drydock prematurely and once we went through and sharpened our pencils. We said, hey, this doesn't have to be done until more inconsistent with a requirement. So we pushed that out. So when these numbers $2 million and $3 million is part of the benefit and you've got some [indiscernible] they're taking out for the workers that are doing the work and they're also getting the scrubbers up and running too. So there is a lot of trust going on, in the fourth quarter relative to getting the ship to the level that we believe, drive the excitement of the brand. You had some other stuff. Wendy Beck : Sure and then on the, I'm sorry it was the yield, right? Kevin Sheehan : The yield, yes. Wendy Beck : So with the commissions transportation, other line as we have said last quarter, we expect that to run rate basis between 15.5% and 16% last quarter was like 15%, this quarter was at 15.8%. there is a number of things that we will see a permanent benefit in and that's due to renegotiated port contracts with significant GTF [ph] savings, but actually benefits our customers. Also renegotiated credit cards cost. We're flowing even more casino channel business through which is as you know, very efficient way to get guest onto our ships from a commissions standpoint and then more targeted incentive programs. So you will see that continue, that's not just a one-time benefit or a two quarter benefit. You will see that, Robin, even into the outer years and we have lot to work to do with the Prestige transaction to continue, to go back and renegotiate it even more great deal, especially on the port and credit card. Kevin Sheehan : Robin, you also asked about the onboard? Robin Farley \u2013 UBS:  I was asking with the charters in Q1, last year. The Sochi and the Bud Light Hotel, just to sort of think about how much they added. When we are thinking about comping, that the up 1% is really on a like, if you \u2013 I guess what part of 3.8% increase last year or earlier this year, was from those charters? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, we don't want to get into too specific. You're asking us questions nobody gives, you that kind of detail and we are only one brand. I would say that, it was probably a little bit over a point of the growth, we are not getting more specific than that. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS:  Okay, alright, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning. So two questions, one can you just talk about your interest in, of expanding into Asia. We've heard about from some of the other cruise companies, especially with the Prestige acquisition because I think, they do go into Asia and do some itineraries and how do you feel about the Norwegian brand going in there. And then second, I'm still struggling with the pricing of Caribbean versus Europe and CCL and RCL generally said, European commentary or European trends were good. I wanted to hear your thoughts and I have to tell you, I was surprised. I saw actually MSC giving a free cruise on one of their new ships in Caribbean, if you booked in the Mediterranean for next summers, I thought that was pretty aggressive stand to whether you're seeing that in other places or other ways. Kevin Sheehan : Well, let me start with that. I mean, I can't really quote too much MSC. It's a great brand. It's a family-owned entity. As you know, they're moving out of the Caribbean as the winter season ends and going back to Europe. So you know, you can do your own thoughts on that. You have to remember MSC is a great brand over in Europe and it's really not in consistently in the United States and it's a massive ship, a massive huge ship what they port in here, along with as you know all the inventory that we talked at the length about. So I think some of that is reality, at getting them in their comfort zone, guests on their ships in their core markets. So that's, that. As far as Europe, we see that continuing, we feel the pricing in Europe will \u2013 remember, we said we had great pricing as an industry in 2014. Let's be real about it. We all had a lot of carnage in '12 and '13. So getting positive pricing is good, of course, but we have a road to go and I think, we are all focused as an industry on getting back to our rightful place and so I think that's a two year, three year journey, but we see good pricing in Europe continuing. As far as Asia, which I think was the last piece. Yes, Prestige of course is a very global brands both Oceania and Regent. They both go too well over 300 destinations over the course of the year throughout Asia and other markets around the globe. Yes, there is learnings on that, for us of course. We also have had learnings from Star Cruises. So Steve, the point is, you know there is a lot of inventory going over to those markets and Kevin, is a little bit more conservative, yell at me, if you want and the other guys joke about. Hey, you're not going to come in, until we all break the market in and then you're going to come in and wash away and then I said, that's really what you do, when you have 13 ships going to 14, 15, 16, 17 over six-year period. So we are going to be cautious, we are going to stay where we know, we have a return that we can continue to deliver the consistency that you've seen since 6.5 years or whatever it is ago, and we will be open of course and as we get out in the future. You know whether it's '16-ish, you should start to see us having a much clear strategy about us because we do believe, we have guests that want us to be us in those markets and we will overtime get there, but again, with an air of caution. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you. Kevin Sheehan : And Shannon, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our next question is from Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research. You may begin Assia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research : Good morning, good job on Q3 and I had a couple of quick questions. Pride of America, does it make sense to possibly move that ship into the ocean \u2013 have any new builds coming in? And tried to explore the full potential of that unique destination? Kevin Sheehan : Yes, a great question and something we're talking about. I'm not a 100% sure, whether it does or doesn't, but you're right. The yields that would be gone, under one of the other brands would be higher, but we think, we have the ability using their marketing approach to benefit greatly from the Delta that's there today, but that is something that is on the cards. You know we have, new leaders on the three brands and that's going to be an intellectual conversation that we will have amongst ourselves and we're going to do. As you know, everything we do, at Norwegian at the end of the day, is with a view to our shareholders. We are here to drive value for our shareholder and so if you're right and that would be a better results, we'd be open to anything. Assia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research : And the kind of you offered me a good segue into the shareholder view. In terms of, the stock that will be used as point of the purchase price. What kind of lockup agreements do you anticipate in lockup terms? Kevin Sheehan : It's a great question and we anticipated it because to be honest with you, the Apollo guys were open to doing anything because they're so excited about the prospects of this company, but at the end of the day, I think what we did is, we locked up \u2013 where did we end up, we locked up the new shares for a year, to December '15? Wendy Beck : '15, December, 2015. Kevin Sheehan : Yes, through 2015 and some of the senior people from Prestige as well. So but it wasn't a big deal because everybody gets it and is excited about where we are going, so I mean we could have done. I probably could have said more if we wanted it, but I think you want to also see some liquidity start to open up, into our shares, but you know the way I look at it is. Now that we become, a bigger company, a big market cap company. The remaining private equity and [indiscernible] holdings. To me are three big shareholders and we look at them. Of course, they have a little bit different terms, but we look at them as three big investors, no different than the other investors that we have, we're working for everybody. Assia Georgieva \u2013 Infinity Research : Great, thank you so much, Kevin. Kevin Sheehan : Thanks, everybody and thanks for your time and your support, look forward to our next quarter and as always, we are here to answer your questions, if there is anything that we haven't covered. Thanks, so much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for this session will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Beck, please proceed. Wendy Beck : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I am joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Drew Madsen, President and Chief Operating Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line; and Jason Montague, President and Chief Operating Officer of Prestige Cruise Holdings. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, followed by our brand presidents, Drew and Jason, who will go into little more color for their respective areas. I will follow with commentary on the results for the fourth quarter and full-year \u201914, as well as provide guidance for 2015, before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. He will then open up the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com, and will be available for replay for 30 days following today\u2019s call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full-year \u201914 results was issued last night, and is available on our Investor Relations website. I would also like to review information about forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP information as a part of this call. The company\u2019s comments today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company\u2019s actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations. The company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecasts or estimates, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see the company\u2019s SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the company\u2019s earnings release. Now with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Before going into my commentary, I\u2019d like to start off by saying how excited I am at being able to lead the most dynamic cruise operating company in the industry. My experience in the cruise industry goes back 20-plus years, and I am more eager and passionate about this opportunity than perhaps any other in my career. As the founder of Oceania Cruises, I understand the entrepreneurs mindset and what it takes to build a brand from scratch, which is why I have the utmost admiration for those pioneers that founded Norwegian Cruise Line close to 50 years ago, with one ship sailing round trip voyages of the vent nascent Port of Miami, these trailblazers did what no one had done before, and in the process not only founded a vendible brand, but they also laid the groundwork for the cruise industry as we know it today. To be able to lead the organization that includes the pioneering Norwegian brand, along with two brands that are leaders in their respective market segments, in synonymous with upscale travel is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I truly relish. The recent histories of Norwegian Cruise Line and Prestige, particularly the Oceania Cruises brand, have run along similar path. Both brands are innovators, with Norwegian introducing a slew of industry-first from the development of a private island destination to the roll-out of its signature freestyle cruising. Meanwhile, Oceania Cruises carved a niche by defining the upper premium segment, with an offering that includes unparalleled cuisines, personalized service and exciting itineraries. Their unique business models and the significant potential of both brands, attracted private equities, who made substantial investments in each during 2007 and 2008. Both brands also embarked on disciplined newbuild programs, which resulted in a successful introduction of Marina and Rivera for Oceania Cruises and Norwegian Epic, Breakaway and Getaway for Norwegian Cruise Line. Their paths diverged slightly though, as Norwegian focused on internal operations to resurrect the brand, while the shareholders of Oceania Cruises combined with Regent Seven Seas Cruises, the former Prestige Cruise Holdings, which I\u2019ve had the privilege of leading since its inception in 2008. So with all these fitting then that the next step in Norwegian\u2019s growth strategy was to look for acquisition opportunities to grow and diversify. Finding the perfect partner was as easily as looking out of Norwegian\u2019s corporate headquarters window and just down the street to Prestige. The experience gleaned from uniting Oceania Cruises and Regent into Prestige, which quickly became the leading operator in the upscale market segment turned out to be the perfect precursor to the opportunity of combining Norwegian Cruise Line and the Prestige brands into a new diversified cruise operator. It\u2019s an opportunity quite frankly that I, along with 30,000 team members under the Prestige and Norwegian banners have thoroughly embraced. Norwegian\u2019s diversification into the upper premium markets was one of two similar vents for the company in 2014, and I\u2019ll return to talk about this employee acquisition later in the call. Just as important, 2014 will be remembered as a year of solid growth for Norwegian Cruise Line in the form of both, fleet expansion and organic growth. The brand welcomed Norwegian Getaway to the fleet in January in a boisterous cushioning that captured that energy and vibrancy of her year around home port in Miami. Since then, her contributions to the brand have been numerous. First, she marks Norwegian\u2019s return to year around seven-day cruising from Miami after a decade long absence. And not only does a Norwegian brand now have a flagship in Miami, she continues to be lines highest rated ship in terms of guest satisfaction. And this is no small feat given the logistics of managing 4,000-plus guests, 20,000-plus dining areas and a host of entertainment venues and lounges. My congratulations go up to Getaways\u2019 offices, crew and staff for tremendous accomplishments. In addition to Norwegian Getaway, the brand had the benefit of a full-year of sailings of Norwegian Breakaway, which was introduced in April 2013. Lastly, strength in Europe and Alaska itineraries drove organic pricing growth and helped offset pronounced promotional environment for Caribbean itineraries. The second significant event of 2014 was Norwegian\u2019s expansion and diversification into the upper end of the cruise market, with the acquisition of Prestige Cruise Holdings. Due to the timing of the transaction late in the year, the result of the acquisition will be more apparent in the coming year, however the long-term benefit of such a transaction are abundantly clear to anyone who follow the industry, and I will discuss synergies later in the call. So putting that topic aside for now, the strategic fit of Norwegian and Prestige is highly complementary. Combining our three brand results indication offerings that run the gamut from an entry-level three-day cruise to the Bahamas, for those who want to test the waters, what a cruise experiences is like, to wait 180-day around the world voyage geared to the most adventurous travelers. In between is a rich diverse portfolio of 21 ships ranging in size from 500 to 4,100 berths, year around in seasonal offerings from home ports worldwide to over 350 ports around the globe. These ships accommodate groups of size from singles to couples to large families and offer experiences ranging from contemporary to ultra-luxury. When you combine the Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas brands, the number of offerings we can provide our guest growth exponentially and we believe it is unmatched in the industry. In addition to the best-in-class assets, the new Norwegian organization, both an exceptional management team with a depth and breadth of experience, both from within and outside of the cruise industry. These leaders fit well into an organizational structure that I personally developed to ensure two things. First, that the market integrity product, characteristics and brand attributes of each brand will remain intact and unaffected by the combination. In other words, each brand will continue to deliver the guest experience that they are known for and any changes likely to be the adoption of best practices going across the fleet will be invisible to the guests. And second that a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing and team work exists, to not only maximize cost and revenue synergies, but also to share best practices in order to enhance the guest experience in cruise operations throughout the three fleets. We have designed this organization to take the best from each brand and craft ways to extend those concept and ideas across the organizations, which in turn elevates the entire company. Three distinct brands and one incredible organization is my mantra. And it provides a direction going forward of how best the organization operates. One of the specific functions of this new org structure that epitomizes this philosophy is dedicated to identifying, quantifying and implementing synergies throughout the organization. This synergy function is headed by seasoned Senior Vice President who I\u2019ve appointed Chief Integration Officer reporting directly to me, and includes resources and expertise from both the Prestige and the Norwegian organization. At the time of the acquisition, we promised synergies in the $25 million range, but we are certain we will achieve that figure this year. In addition, we are well on our way to getting out additional expense synergies and revenue opportunities, which we will share with you in future calls. At the time of the acquisition, we promised cost synergies in the $25 million range, and we are reiterating this level for 2015, having identified synergies in the consolidation of office operations, insurance cost, port fees and shore excursion concessionaire contracts. In addition, I am pleased to report we have also identified revenue synergies of $15 million, exclusively from opportunities in onboard revenue, for a first year synergy of at least $40 million. And that is embedded in our guidance. These same line items that constitute $40 million synergy savings in 2015 equates to some $50 million in 2016 based on full-year. The overall strategic plan that had been put in place by Kevin remains substantially unchanged. My leadership team and I will focus on stimulating organic growth, much of which will come from the learnings that the three brands will share and then creating a culture of flawless execution, which together we expect, will accelerate net yield growth, suppress costs and lead to increased earnings per share. In addition, we will tap our collective experience in developing leading brands and cultivating a loyal past guest space that we know we\u2019re willing to pay a premium for great vacation experiences. Many of these initiatives will focus on investments to drive demand and bolster the top line, as evidenced by the recent expansion of Norwegian\u2019s North American sales team and the creation of a corporate level Chief of International Operations with responsibility over the three brands. Lastly, we are investing in marketing initiatives to stimulate demand and promote upcoming capacity additions. This additional marketing which was already planned is already bearing fruit, as demonstrated by Norwegian Escape, which is booking better than two our Breakaway class predecessors. We are also investing and expanding Norwegian\u2019s presence in the Canadian market, a rich market for the Prestige brands in which Norwegian has historically lagged. Turning to our results, while Wendy will go over them in detail, I\u2019d be remised to not give them the spotlight they deserve. The benefit from Norwegian\u2019s fleet expansion and organic growth are brought about strong results. Adjusted earnings per share for 2014 grew an impressive 61% over the prior year and come on the heels of a 45% increase in 2013. Excluding the consolidation of Prestige\u2019s results, adjusted earnings per share for 2014 grew by 65%. Adjusted net yield for the year increased 4.8%, including Prestige and 3.3% on our Norwegian stand-alone basis. These results demonstrate the ongoing strength of the Norwegian brand. Now, there is a lot to cover this morning on this call, so I\u2019ll hand it over to Drew now to discuss the Norwegian brand in more detail. Drew? Drew Madsen : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Since this is my first opportunity to speak with all of you, I thought I would start with a very brief summary of my background before joining Norwegian. I spent the first half of my career in the consumer products industry, primarily at General Mills, in various marketing and general management roles. Most recently, I spent the last 15 years with Darden Restaurants, which used to be part of General Mills and had the opportunity to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer and a member of the Board of Directors for the last nine years. Now while at Darden, I learned that the ability to earn a competitive superior total shareholder return over a sustained period in the restaurant business was driven by three critical dynamics. First, you need to create a compelling experience that your guests just can't get anywhere else. Second, you need to build a culture that embraces both executional excellence and innovation, so that you can earn superior guest loyalty by consistently exceeding your expectations in the near-term, while evolving your experience to stay relevant over the long-term. And third, you need to maintain a strong business model for both existing units and newly build units, to ensure the sales growth driven by improving guest loyalty ultimately produces the appropriate amount of cash flow and value creation for investors. Now while there are clearly differences between restaurants and crew ships, there are also meaningful similarities in important areas, and I was attracted to Norwegian because of their tremendous performance since 2008 and each dynamic that I just described, as well as by their significant growth potential going forward. And that strong performance certainly continued during 2014. One incremental quarter sailings from Norwegian Breakaway, which came into service in April of 2013, and close to full-year of operation from Norwegian Getaway, which came into service in February of 2014, help produce another year of record results. First, we carried a record number of guests during 2014, breaking the two million guest mark for the first time in Norwegian\u2019s history. In addition, the business achieved 3.3% net revenue yield growth during 2014. And with the net revenue yield of $189.69, we have now surpassed our 2008 record net yield by 11.5%. And a continued strong focus on disciplined cost management and profitability, ensured that our returns remained strong as well, as evidenced by our record adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.5%. So in summary, our foundation remains strong. The strategy that\u2019s been in place for several years is working, and the business is well positioned for continued profitable growth. Looking ahead in 2015, Norwegian will open the first of our Breakaway Plus Class ships, Norwegian Escape. She is built on the proven platform of our Breakaway class predecessors with additional staterooms in public areas, enhancing not only our ROI but also the experience for our guests. Norwegian Escape will have a largest haven complex on our fleet; two new dining experiences from James Beard Award-winner, Jose Garces; the first snow room spa treatment at sea and will also debut venues tied to our new partnerships with Margaritaville and the Michael Mondavi Family winery. Further arrival will establish Norwegian as the premier brands sailing from Miami with the newest and most innovative hardware deployed in the cruise capital. Now along with our Norwegian Escape will also debut our newest destination in the Caribbean, Harvest Caye. This unique island destination offers guests a relaxing beach experience, with the usual activities, while also taking full advantage of the surrounding natural attractions. Our guests will also have the opportunity to explore the architectural, cultural and natural riches of Southern Belize\u2019s mainland. Harvest Caye will serve as an anchor for our Western Caribbean itineraries beginning in the fall. As Frank already mentioned, our plan for 2015 also includes incremental marketing investment in television during the Wave season that we did not have at this time last year, as well as more support for the launch of Escape than we had for the introduction of Getaway last year. And to-date bookings on Escape are in line with our expectations and well ahead of where they were for Getaway at a similar period last year. In addition, given the importance of the North American travel agent distribution channel to our business, we also regionally announced the substantial expansion to our North American sales team, almost doubling the number of business development managers in the field and increasing the overall sales group by more than 40%. Building on our partners search philosophy, this investment signifies our commitment to have been the most engaged, empowered and responsive sales team in the cruise industry, in order to promote the long-term success of our value travel partners. We believe this investment will more than pay for itself by providing the organization capability required to effectively sell our growing capacity, and to more fully penetrate underdeveloped markets where we already do business. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to my colleague, Jason Montague, to give some commentary on Oceania and Regent. Jason? Jason Montague : Thanks, Drew, and good morning, everyone. As this is the first earnings call including the Prestige brand, I thought I would start with a quick background on myself, as well as both Oceania and Regent. I personally had the good fortune of working with Frank since we launched Oceania back in 2002. In addition to assisting with the launch of Oceania, I also headed up the integration efforts when Regent was acquired back in 2008, and for the last five years I served as Prestige\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. My experience with both brands has allowed me to have a deep understanding of the entire operational for each, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited to lead both brands moving forward. The Oceania Cruises\u2019 brand is a market leader in the upper premium segment and was a pioneer of this segment. Oceania is focused on providing affluent and mature cruises with a gourmet culinary experience, elegant accommodations, personalized service and worldwide destinations, all at a compelling value. With five mid-sized ships, Oceania visits approximately 330 ports around the globe, is ranked as one of the world\u2019s best cruise lines by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, and Travel & Leisure. The fleet includes three 684-passenger R-class ships and two 1,250-passenger O-class ships, which were introduced in 2011 and 2012. In 2014, Oceania reached an important milestone in recording its one millionth booking, which is a testament for brand that was established a little over a decade ago. The Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand is a market leader in luxury segment of the industry. Regent, established in 1992, provides the cruise industry\u2019s most inclusive vacation experience, which includes free air transportation, free unlimited shore excursions, dining in all specialty restaurants, all gratuities, premium wines experience. And for the concierge suites, free pre-cruise hotel night and free internet. The brand operates three award-winning, all-suite ships totaling 1,890 berths that include itineraries to approximately 300 ports worldwide. The Regent brand focuses on providing the highest level of personal service, inviting shore excursions, world-class accommodations and top-rated cuisine. Both brands target customers who are 55 years of age or older, have a net worth of over $1 million, is well educated and is a seasoned world traveler. This target audience has reached an age and wealth status with the convenience, comfort and luxury amenities of an upscale cruise product are extremely appealing. Oceania-Regent have also built loyal and repeat customer bases, whereby 44% and 51% respectively of the 2014 passengers were repeat guests. Also in 2014, approximately 59% of Prestige\u2019s total guests responded to Prestige\u2019s customer satisfaction survey, of which, 97% of respondents reported that their cruise experience met or exceeded their expectations and 93% reported they would likely return. Both brands have also implemented a differentiated price enhancing revenue management strategy that encourages our target market to book early to obtain the most attractive value offering, with bookings made up to 21 months in advance of sale date. When we launch new itineraries, we clearly articulate to potential customers that travel agents and travel agents that the prices are subject to increase as the cruise date approaches, as well as the specific dates on which those price increases may occur. We believe the travel agent community favors our pricing strategy as it allows them to provide value to their customers in a completely transparent manner, resulting in early bookings. This early booking cycle allows us to make more informed decisions about pricing, inventory management and marketing efforts. We also have new capacity additions at both brands coming in 2016. Oceania has purchased an additional R-class ship, that is a sister ship to Regatta, Insignia and Nautica. This 684-passenger ship will be named Sirena, and will undergo a $40 million dry dock in March of next year and will join the fleet in April 2016. These R-class ships are extremely popular with the loyal Oceania customer base, and the yields of these original Oceania vessels continue to increase despite Oceania adding additional 2,500 in new berth capacity in 2011 and 2012, with the introduction of the Marina and Rivera O-class ships. The inaugural season for Sirena will open for bookings next month and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to have this fourth R-class ship join the next year. Regent\u2019s newest ship, the Seven Seas Explorer is being built by Fincantieri in Italy, and is set to launch in July 2016. At 56,000 gross registered tons and carrying just 750 guests, the all-suite, all balcony ship will boast among the highest space ratio in the cruise industry. It is designed to be the most luxurious ship ever built, with every inch of the vessel evoking elegance and grace. With a one-of-a-kind opulent 3,875 square-foot suite, extravagantly designed lounges and showplaces and lavish gourmet restaurants, Regent is setting a new standard for luxury vacations with the launch of Explorer. Explorer has been met with unprecedented demand setting the single-day and single-week records for bookings when she opened sales exclusively to our Seven Seas society members, demonstrating the strong loyalty and pent up demand from our guests. In regards to current business trends, regional and geopolitical issues impacting booking levels include Ebola, which had a negative impact on our exotic sailings, as well as the Putin-Ukraine conflict, which did not start to impact prior year numbers for the Black Sea and Baltic sailings until later this quarter last year. Specific to the Regent brand, we are also seeing significant increased booking activity in 2016 with the excitement over Explorer, and I believe this has had a slight negative impact as it relates to 2015 bookings. Based on the voluminous feedback from the travel agent community and from our past guests, I also believe that booking velocity was negatively impacted during fourth quarter by the announcement in closing under the Prestige transaction with Norwegian. Continued feedback we received indicated that travel agents and guests were concerned that the overall Oceania and Regent experience maybe negatively impacted by the acquisition and that they were going to take a wait and see approach before booking either brand. We have made a concerted effort at both brands to reassure our partners and guests that our focus is to maintain and improve on the existing outstanding vacation experiences that each brand delivers to every guest. The combination of this communication effort, as well as the announcement of Frank assuming the role of President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, has had a positive impact. And since the Frank announcement, we have seen positive year-over-year booking velocity at both brands. I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Wendy Beck. Wendy? Wendy Beck : Great. Thank you, Jason. I\u2019ll begin the commentary on full-year results, which unless otherwise noted, compares full-year 2014 and 2013 on an as-reported basis. These results include a partial period of Prestige, the acquisition of which closed on November 19, 2014. To better demonstrate results excluding this sub-period, we have also included certain metrics that exclude the results of Prestige and the impact in the acquisition which we will refer to Norwegian\u2019s stand-alone. For the full-year 2014, the company generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 on an as-reported basis, which is 61% improvement from prior year. And as Frank mentioned earlier, it comes off of a 45% increase in 2013. On a stand-alone basis, Norwegian generated adjusted EPS of $2.32, a 64.5% increase from last year and at the upper end of our guidance. Adjusted net yield on as-reported basis increased 4.8%. Net yield on the Norwegian stand-alone basis increased 3.3% or 3.2% on a constant currency basis, on both improved ticket and onboard net yields, with strong pricing in Europe and a strong Alaska which offset the promotional year that we experienced in the Caribbean. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day increased 3.5% on an as-reported basis and 1% on the Norwegian stand-alone basis, driven by investments in our Norwegian next fleet enhancement programs and increased marketing expenses to stimulate demand in the fourth quarter and into Wave season. We present net cruise cost metrics excluding fuel expense, as we feel it better reflects the underlying earnings power of our companies. While we utilized hedges to mitigate fluctuations with fuel prices and provide predictability of our future fuel expenses, the recent sharp reduction in fuel prices has proved steeper than in the past, resulting in a significant impact from our hedge portfolio. In 2014, our fuel price per metric ton excluding the impact of hedges was $605 compared to $686 in 2013. We experienced a negative impact in 2014 of $10.3 million or $0.05 per share on our hedge portfolio, due to recent reductions in fuel prices, compared to a benefit of $4.7 million or $0.02 per share in 2013. Net of hedges, fuel price per metric ton decreased to $625, compared to $675 in 2013. In order to facilitate the calculation of future impact of the fuel prices, we have included annual hedge percentages along with the average price per metric ton as the hedge portfolio in the Guidance Section of our earnings release. Interest expense net was $151.8 million versus $282.6 million in 2013. 2014, it was $15.4 million related to financing transactions in connection with the acquisition of Prestige, while 2013 includes a $160.6 million in expenses associated with debt repayments. The increase in interest expense was a result of higher overall borrowings attributable to the addition of Norwegian Getaways to our fleet and the acquisition of Prestige. As planned, pro forma leverage for the year ticked upward to approximately 5x as a result of the result of the Prestige acquisition, and we continued to anticipate we will be below 4x within the next 18 months. The impact of the Prestige acquisition are more evident in results for the fourth quarter, for approximately half of the period includes Prestige\u2019s results. On an as-reported basis, adjusted earnings per share was $0.36 or $0.40 on a Norwegian stand-alone basis. Adjusted net yields increased to 11.1% in the periods, driven by a 3.9% increase in Norwegian stand-alone net yields and the addition of the premium-priced Oceania and Regent fleets. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuels per capacity day increased 9.9% on an as-reported basis, while it was essentially flat on a Norwegian stand-alone basis. As with full-year results the impact on our hedge portfolio as a result of lower fuel prices was primarily felt in the fourth quarter. Fuel price per metric ton net of hedges was $599 in 2014, down from $649 in 2013. Excluding hedges, prices were $529 and $656 in each of these periods. The impact on our hedge portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $10.5 million or about $0.05 per share, while 2013 experienced a negligible benefit. Interest expense net increased to $56.4 million from $24.6 million, primarily due to the aforementioned charges related to financing transactions and incremental interest expense from additional debt incurred in relation to the acquisition of Prestige. Now looking to 2015, we have provided guidance along with associated sensitivities for the first quarter and the full-year 2015 in our earnings release. In addition to providing guidance on an as-reported basis for net yield and net cruise costs, we are also providing guidance on these metrics against 2014 combined company results as the basis with which to compare 2015 expectations. These combined company results assume the consolidated results of Norwegian and Prestige to the first quarter and full-year 2014 as of the beginning of that year. As discussed in our prior comments, we are expecting tougher comps in the Norwegian brands in the first quarter of 2015, due to a strong first quarter of 2014, which saw net yields rise 3.8% as resulted in extended charter of Norwegian Jade for the Sochi Olympics, and a charter of Norwegian Getaway during the 2014 Super Bowl in New York, as well as an increase in the number of six-manned charters in 2014 which level off in 2015. In addition in January, the Norwegian brand will lap the first year of Norwegian Getaway to the year around trading itinerary was impacted by the promotional environment in Norwegian which we see continuing into Q1. Later in the year, Norwegian Escape reaches Miami to a Caribbean environment where capacity growth will have stabilized. The impact of Norwegian Getaway\u2019s operation during promotional Q1 and the benefit of Norwegian Escape entry in less promotional Q4, in essence offset each other, resulting in a year of organic growth for the Norwegian brands in the Caribbean sailings [ph]. Turning to the Oceania-Regent brand, as Jason previously mentioned, by virtue of the more intricate product offering and early base-loading strategy, those brands have the benefit of expanded booking windows, which provides greater visibility into our future revenues. With this backdrop, we present the following guidance for first quarter 2015. On an as-reported basis, as a result of the combination with the premium priced Prestige brands, we expect adjusted net yields to be in the range of 17% to 18%. On a combined company basis, we expect to be down 1% to 2%, and flat to down 1% on a constant currency basis as a result of the promotional environment for Caribbean itinerary, which we will see extending into the first quarter. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day, on an as-reported basis, is expected to increase between 27% and 28% due to the consolidation with Prestige. However, on a combined company basis, we expect an increase of 4.5% to 5.5% or 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis due to incremental marketing expense that includes the return to television advertising for the Norwegian brands. And lastly, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.20 to $0.24. While the first quarter is still experiencing the challenges of a promotional Caribbean environment, there is optimism for the balance of the year as demonstrated by following full-year 2015 expectations. Adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 17.5% on an as-reported basis on a combined company basis. We expect yield improvement of approximately 1.5% or approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. The spread between as-reported and constant currency is wider than normal, as a result of recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to increase approximately 23.5% on an as-reported basis, while on a combined company basis, we expect an increase of approximately 2.75% to 3.25% on a constant currency basis. Due to increased investment in marketing, including return to television for the Norwegian brand and incremental marketing, leading up to the introductions of Norwegian Escape, Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Sirena and incremental dry dock expense compared to prior year. As I previously stated, we felt it would be useful to investors to isolate the impact of fluctuation in few places as it relates to our hedged portfolio in order to provide a better picture of the underlying performance of the business. We have included projected fuel prices per metric ton for the first quarter and full-year 2015, both excluding and including the impact of our hedge portfolio. The negative impact on results due to the average costs of our hedges versus current market prices is approximately $35 million or $0.15 per share in the first quarter, and $120 million or $0.52 per share in the full-year 2015. Regarding depreciation and amortization, we have guided a full-year depreciation expense of between $335 million and $345 million, which is on an adjusted basis, but excludes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition. And lastly in a year that is substantially organic growth-driven, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.90, which represents an approximately 23% increase from 2014 combined company adjusted EPS. Turning to deployment. The addition of Oceania-Regent has diversified our deployments to include destinations outside of those covered by the Norwegian brands. To demonstrate the benefits of this diversification, the following compares 2015 deployment on a combined basis to 2014 on a Norwegian stand-alone basis. Caribbean capacity in 2015 is down to 40.4% compared to 47.9% in 2014. This includes the partial periods of Norwegian Getaway and Norwegian Escape, both sailing year around Caribbean. And as a point of reference, Norwegian Caribbean deployment for 2015 is 45.5%. Europe itineraries are up 22.8% of our deployment compared to 20.7% in 2014. Bermuda and Alaska itineraries remain about the same at approximately 7.5% each, while the share of Hawaii deployment dipped to 5.3% from 6.4% in 2014. Up from negligible amounts in 2014, Asia, Africa, Pacific now accounts for 3.3% of our itineraries while South America will account for 1.6%. For the first quarter of 2015, deployment is as follows; 67.9% of capacity is in the Caribbean in 2015 compared to 72.1% in 2014, with the Norwegian brand applying 74.1% of the capacity in Norwegian in 2015. Europe deployment was essentially flat at 11%, while Asia, Africa, Pacific and South America, those increased from negligible amounts in 2014 to 7.4% and 1.9% respectively in 2015. This diversified in global deployment embodies the future of the new Norwegian organization more diverse and more excited and higher yielding theaters of operations and with the potential to do even more. This year marks my 50 year at Norwegian, and I can say that right now as the most excited and eager as I have ever been about the opportunities that lie ahead for this organization. With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thanks, Wendy. And while my six week tenure in Norwegian is just a little bit shorter than yours, I too sharing the excitement of opportunities that lay before us. The timing of the Prestige acquisition was such that it allowed us to begin 2015 with strong momentum, generated by the potential and opportunities of this combination. Our unified and passionate team is hard at worked to ensure that we build upon Norwegian\u2019s strong foundation to grow our three brands and improve upon their already industry-leading financial performance. I know that some of you are expecting some sort of revolutionary announcement regarding Norwegian\u2019s future. But it is simply too early in the game to make any definitive declarations regarding expansion into new markets, orders for new ships or any other major strategic announcements. These things may happen in time, and if they do happen, it will be after intense study and careful consideration. I have a proven track record in building leading brands with award-winning product offerings supported by loyal customers, while driving significant revenue and profit growth. Couple this with a Norwegian brand that has delivered five years of consistent earnings growth and best-in-class metrics, and I believe that by pulling our talent and exploding the opportunities that lie ahead will result in a most dynamic, the most innovative, and quite simply, the best cruise operating company in the industry. Thank you all for your continued support. We\u2019d like to go ahead and open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open. Harry Curtis : Hi, good morning, everyone. Frank, I had a quick question, and it\u2019s really just looking for a bit more detail about what you\u2019re really excited about given - putting the two companies together. Can you talk a little bit more about the combined companies or the advantages of the combined companies, scale, the age of its fleet, topics like that, that give you some enthusiasm for the next three to five years? Frank Del Rio : Harry, it gives me a lot of enthusiasm. And I think you hit a couple of major points, the scale opportunity is tremendous. Coming from 6,500 beds to over 40,000 beds and 18,000 more on the way are certainly exciting and it just gives us so much more room to be able to apply the known basis business principles that led to outsize returns and great growth in both revenue and profits at the Prestige brands and to bring those concepts over to the Norwegian brand. Like I said earlier, I\u2019ve been here six weeks, but I can tell you that this management team is excited. They\u2019re engaged. They understand what we\u2019re trying to do. They agree what the philosophies that we\u2019re trying to incorporate across the organization, and it\u2019s going to yield wonderful results, if you\u2019re going to see in time both in the revenue section of the P&L and the cost section of the P&L. In terms of the fleet, Norwegian has got a heck of a fleet with more fantastic ships coming. Escape is just a groundbreaker for us, a game changer, if you will. And I think that our customers are agreeing with us. As Drew mentioned, the sales of Escape are really off the charge. We\u2019re really happy with both the velocity, volume of bookings and their pricing. The trends are incredibly strong, and we\u2019ll be looking to raise prices on Escape, because quite frankly, the load factors are just remarkable. Getaway, Breakaway, Epic, all fantastic ships in their own right, still generating double-digit yields of premiums over the rest of the fleet, excluding part of America, which is a one-time or is a unique product in and of itself. The Prestige fleet is a heck of a fleet. The Marina and Rivera were greatly - they were very well accepted I should say by the Oceania people and now being able to bring, to the fleet a four R-class ship. Those ships are timeless. The level of support evidenced by the strong per diems that those ship generates is just mind boggling. And so been able to purchase the vessel and refurbish for an all-in cost of some $180,000 per bed against the backdrop of the per diems that she generates is an incredible ROI story. And then there is Explorer, the Regent newbuild. Regent hasn\u2019t had a newbuild since 2003. So we may accelerate the next Regent ship a little bit faster than every 13 years. And it was excited. And as Jason mentioned, the overwhelming outpoured of support by the past guests is off the charts. It actually will be the most luxurious crew ship ever built, and I think that kind of products, commitment by the Regent brand is really resonating with these ultra-high-net worth individuals who are the ones who take these cruises. Harry Curtis : Frank, just a quick follow-up on that. In the third quarter conference call, trying to boil this down to Norwegian\u2019s combined earning power with Prestige. Kevin mentioned the potential for the organization to double earnings through 2017. You\u2019ve only been there a number of weeks, but do you think that he was heading down the right path? Frank Del Rio : I do. If you look back to the actual performance of the company since its IPO in 2013, the company generated $1.41 in earnings per share in \u201913. In 2015, if you take the midpoint of the guidance that Wendy laid out, will be at $2.80. So we will have doubled earnings per share in two years. And we believe that $5 is certainly or slightly above $5 is the target for \u201917, which would be another 79% increase over where we are for 2015. And of course, if you have those kind of earnings per share improvements over time, by definition, your ROIC is also going to improve. And as you may recall in 2013, when the IPO took place, the ROIC for Norwegian was 7%. We believe we will break into double-digits next year. And in \u201914 - in 2018, excuse me, we will double our ROIC from the 2013 starting point of 7%. So, some 14% in 2018. So it\u2019s a strong financial performance. Harry Curtis : Frank, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is now open. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I have a question a little bit more near-term focus. I was interested in the line in the release that talked about the acceleration in bookings in wave season in the last three weeks, and I wonder if you could give a little color around that? Do you think that volume was kind of like independent of specific marketing spend or was it driven by specific promotions or it\u2019s just broadly across the board you\u2019re seeing that hasn\u2019t worked yet. Frank Del Rio : We are seeing it across all brands, although the Norwegian brand probably saw the most pronounced spike during the last three weeks. And it\u2019s continued through this week. So we have a chat on Friday, I would tell you that it\u2019s going to be four weeks and not just three. So the trend continues. You know what? You never know why one business is good or one business is bad. It\u2019s never one single factor. It\u2019s always the combination of factors, but we do have a compelling promotion in the marketplace, especially for the Norwegian brand that seen the highest spike. As you know, we come from a mindset at the Prestige brands where we market to fill as opposed to discount to fill. And while I\u2019m not suggesting that that strategy will work exactly the same way that Norwegian as it does it for Prestige, I think it\u2019s a work pursuing, and see how much we can convert this idea that the only leverage that our company - the only leverage that the company has to simulate demand is lower pricing. And so we introduced a promotion at Norwegian that didn\u2019t focused on lower prices but focused instead on more value. And that\u2019s something that we have over time perfected at the Prestige brands. And as you know, the Prestige brands have the highest per diems in their classes of any one in the company - in the industry. So look, we\u2019re fixated on yield increases. We\u2019re fixated on earnings per share improvements. I know the old accountant that you have to have a balance attack, so it\u2019s not going to be judged on the heels of yield improvements that we\u2019re going to get our earnings per share up, but also on cost control and cost consciousness. To give you an example on that, one of my direct reports in our new orchard will be to head of purchasing. I want the entire organization to understand that effective purchasing keeping costs down is important, and that\u2019s why the head of purchasing reports directly to the CEO. But you lead with revenue, you can't save your way to success over the long-term, but you can't ignore it, you can't be sloppy with costs. You got be very crisp. When you operate a company that has 17, 18 million bed days a year, every dollar you find is another 17 or 18 million or $0.08 or $0.09 earnings per share to the bottom line. And an organization of this size, I will tell you that there are plenty of these $1 nuggets of opportunities to reduce costs. We\u2019ve already found some after five weeks and there are just as many of those opportunities to perhaps in the revenue side, of which, we\u2019ve also find some very exciting opportunities. So it\u2019s going to be a balanced attack. We\u2019re going to strike at both, finding costs - and that\u2019s just six months synergy that everyone will focus on. This will be an ongoing operation. If you look at numbers that we were able to generate at Prestige is only 6,500 beds and able to control our costs year-after-year, even with the introduction of new ships. You\u2019ll know that our management team has that mindset of keeping costs down. It\u2019s not just about revenue growth. Robin Farley : That\u2019s great. And then just the other thing I would ask is looking at the difference between growth and net yield. That looks like it\u2019s been a driver of net yield for lower commissions line. Is that something that was sort of anniversaried in Q2 if that also seem to help in Q2 and Q3 last year? Is that something you\u2019ll anniversary in Q2 this year or do you think that can actually continue to drive incremental net yields? Wendy Beck : Hi Robin, it\u2019s Wendy. I\u2019ll take that. So as we had mentioned on those, the Q2 and the Q3 call, we did have some fundamental changes in our cost of sales structure. We worked very hard to really leverage our overall scale by expanding casino partnerships, renegotiating agreements, particularly port agreements, credit card processing fees and then in addition lowering our air subsidies, we\u2019re - this is going to carry on. This is not a one-time benefit that we\u2019ve reset the bar on an ongoing basis. So with that said, when you bring in the Prestige brands, their costs fell significantly higher being in all-inclusive type business or a lot of it\u2019s all inclusive. Frank Del Rio : Yes, to give you an example that the businesses are little bit different. Do you recall, Robin at Prestige just about every booking includes air. We marketed it as free air, but it\u2019s felt in the price of the product, whereas at Norwegian, given all the deployments of the vessels out of home ports, we now have ships in New York, in Miami, in Tampa, in New Orleans, Houston. People drive to the ships a lot more. And so at Norwegian, the air participation of our guests buying air to take a cruise is below 2%. And so you basically have two different worlds, wherein at Oceania and Regent it\u2019s almost 100% and in Norwegian it\u2019s negligible. My guess is that as we tinker with the Norwegian itineraries and reposition vessels away from the Western Caribbean primarily which is the lowest yielding itineraries in the marketplace and the glut that has been - the glut that we\u2019ve seen over the years is to perhaps higher yielding itineraries. I think the air participation at Norwegian will tend to increase because customers simply cannot drive to the places that we may put the ships. Wendy Beck : And I just wanted to tag in there. So we had kind of reset the bar that are commissioned transportation and other line was running ongoing at about 15% cliff. But that again was not from lowering travel agent commissions, it was the other thing that I mentioned. PCH on the other hand is more around the 30% mark. So on a consolidated basis, you should anticipate somewhere in the upper 18% range. Robin Farley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Steven Kent : Hi, a couple of questions. Frank and Wendy, you mentioned a couple of times cost and revenue synergies, but how is it going to work if since Prestige used Apollo Chandler to do quite a bit of their operations. If you find something because you want to implement from Norwegian onto the Prestige brands, how will the shareholders see the benefits of that? And then you now mentioned a couple of times the potential for maybe some more shifts. Any thoughts Frank on Regent and Oceania brands supply growth, Norwegian is much, much further out as you started to hit some quotas to where you would go with the Regent and Oceania brands out into the \u201917, \u201918, \u201919?. Frank Del Rio : Yes, regarding the new vessel additions, we\u2019re - the Prestige brands historically have grown organically. As I mentioned earlier, the last new ship that Regent introduced was in 2003 when the Voyager came on line. So 13 years maybe a bit long, even for you Steve. But with the new vessel coming in 2016, we have no plans in the horizon to add another Regent vessel. My sense is that on an ongoing basis, assuming a stable marketplace with no outside major events influencing the overall markets, that a luxury line like Regent could take delivery of a vessel every five years or so. The Oceania brand perhaps can take a new vessel every 36 to 42 months, because these brands have one thing that many other brands don\u2019t have and that is pricing power. Like most luxury goods, whether it\u2019s in cruising or another consumer staples or having limited supply gives you pricing power. And so over the years, the CAGR of net yield growth per diems at, both the Oceania and the Regent brands, have outperformed the contemporary brands for the company. And so we think that kind of dynamic will continue and will add capacity when it makes sense, but it\u2019s not the kind of business model that depends on new capacity to grow the bottom line. The Prestige brands have shown that you can do it without adding new capacity. On the other hand, Norwegian has got quite a bit of capacity already coming on line, four vessels to 2019. Give me a few more weeks and I\u2019ll maybe give you an update, but after the first six weeks that I\u2019m not pressed to announce the new order for delivery in 2020 or \u201821. I will tell you that I do want to start looking at ways to organically grow the Norwegian brand similar to what we did at Prestige if it can be worked out. There are differences between the products, differences between the market segments. But to give you an example, a new vessel generated $100 million of net income. Given the size at Norwegian has now reached, Norwegian, would have to generate net yields above and beyond the norm, but let's assume for a minute that the norm is 3%. So Norwegian would have to generate yields of - yield growth of 6%, 3% more, to generate the same net income that it would have to generate by ordering a new 4,000-plus passenger vessel. So the question will be, can you grow your top line and your bottom line in a manner other than ordering another vessel and levering up the balance sheet and waiting for years for the ship to come along? We\u2019ve proven that we can do it at the Prestige brands, and we will try. We will investigate. We\u2019re going to improve the product. We\u2019re going to improve the delivery of the service onboard to see whether we can generate an extra 3%. When you look at in absolute terms a product like Norwegian, the average per diems are in the neighborhood of $130 a day. So an extra 3%, you\u2019re talking $4. So you ask yourself, can you have a compelling enough product that people are willing to come to you and pay an extra $4 a day, an extra $28 a week, an extra $56 for Mr. and Ms. Who are coming onboard. And I look at myself and I say, I think we can. We\u2019re not asking for the world. But you got to deliver a top notch world-class product and that\u2019s what we aim to do. In terms of what you have said earlier about some of the product and services that are outsourced with third-party. They do a great job. The reason why Oceania and Regent generate the per diems they generate is because the product is worth it. And for the most part, this third-party is the one who delivers the onboard product experience. They\u2019ve been partners for a long time and they\u2019ve got a contract that lasts to 2020 that will be with us till then. But they are great partners and already were begun trying to figure out ways where both parties can leverage these buying power of each, the logistical problems that each one has, and Apollo is very good at logistics with the Prestige fleet scattered throughout the world. They have figured out how to get tomatoes and carrots and chicken and everything else to the ships in a very efficient manner and we think we can piggyback off of that what they do at Norwegian brands. So we think there are ways to negotiate with Apollo. Still keep them onboard on the Prestige brands, but be able to realize some savings on the Norwegian side. Steven Kent : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Your line is open. Jamie Katz : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m curious about sourcing from other markets. I know the U.S. is still a very important, but how do you see increasing penetration overseas, especially in light of any sort of FX changes in the recent quarter? Frank Del Rio : Yes, FX, issues aside and those are - they come and go in cycles. I will tell you that one of the biggest opportunities that I see at the Norwegian brand is to expand their footprint internationally, especially with the four new ships coming. To give you an idea, if the Norwegian brand were to able to source the same percentage of guests internationally outside of North America that the Prestige brands generate, that would produce 210,000 new passengers a year, just about the number you need to fill one of the new Breakaway Plus class ships. Canada alone - if the Norwegian brand can penetrate the Canadian market to the same degree that the Prestige brand has penetrated the Canadian market is 100,000 new passengers a year. So we think there is a lot of opportunity relatively low-hanging fruit, to increase the business at Norwegian internationally. The fellow that I have tapped to head are international operation is one of the co-founders of Oceania. He has been with me since day one. A proven leader, a fellow named Bob Binder. He has been the one responsible for leading the rapid growth of the Prestige brands internationally. He has been growing the business 25%, 30% a year for the last four, five years. And I think he can do the same at Norwegian. Jamie Katz : And then I think on the call you guys had mentioned identify, quantify and implement plans to reduce expenses above and beyond the $25 million in synergies. Is there any opportunity that has presented itself that maybe would be meaningful enough to talk about right now, or are you still in the process of really working through that? Frank Del Rio : Yes. We don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. We don\u2019t want to promise what we can't deliver. We don\u2019t even want to whisper a different number other than the ones we\u2019ve already told you about. But after five weeks, have I exhausted every single opportunity that maybe out there? No, I haven't. Is there more? Probably. I don\u2019t want to quantify what probably means, but it\u2019s a big company. We spent over $3 billion a year, and so there is room to find more synergies. Likewise, I\u2019m excited about revenue synergies. Lots of opportunities for the brands to learn from one another on revenue, on sourcing customers, on raising prices. And so you\u2019ve already seen a bit of it in the release today. We\u2019ve identified $15 million this year of solid revenue opportunities that combined up for the full-year of 2015 would combine with the cost is the run rate of $50 million. So we\u2019re going to keep digging. The Chief Integration Officer is focused solely on that. He and his team are incentivized to find every nugget of gold that\u2019s out there. And if I know, Harry Sommer, who is heading that up, he is going to do a hell of a job. Jamie Katz : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Boyer : Hi guys, this is actually Brad in for Steve. So Frank, in our conversations with members of the trade and the Asian community, what we often hear high-praise for the way in which Prestige handle those relationships previously. Just curious beyond the expansion of the sales centers that you highlighted on the call, is there any opportunities you see on a combined company basis to improve relations with the travel agent community and perhaps educate them more on the cross-selling opportunities that exist between the two brands? Frank Del Rio : Yes, in terms of relations, I don\u2019t think the relations need any improvement or patching up. I think Andy Stuart and his team are well respected, like loved if you will by the agency community. They know him well. Norwegian has always been a very strong supporter of the distribution system. So I think we\u2019re in good step there with agents across all three brands. In terms of opportunities, one of the first things that we\u2019ve done is to take a look to see what travel agents are booking one brands versus the others. And if we see gaps, we\u2019re reaching out to say, look, you\u2019re a big supporter of Norwegian, we love you for that, but you\u2019re not selling much Oceania-Regent, how can we talk to you about that and vice-versa. And so that is a big opportunity. And the biggest opportunity is outside of North America, especially in Canada and in the U.K. and in Australia and in Germany, where we have relationships with the distribution system and those places that one brand may not be taking advantage over another. In terms of cross-selling opportunities, the Prestige brands rely heavily on direct marketing. When you\u2019re selling products whose per diems are sometimes over $1,000, the shotgun approach doesn\u2019t work very well. It had to be very, very targeted. So having direct mail, having the names, addresses, email addresses of known cruises is important. But to give you an example, at Oceania-Regent, each of those brands has a past guest file of some 150,000 households. And out of that, 150,000 households, roughly half the business adjacent had a moment ago comes from the past guests. So if we could find another couple of hundred thousand households of known cruisers that Oceania and Regent can market to, that would more than double their source of who we go market to. And guess what? We found 210,000 households in the Norwegian past guest database that have the psychographic demographic spending habits similar to the Oceania customers and Norwegian customers. So we\u2019re going to be marketing heavily to them. And so we love the opportunity of cross-selling high-end Norwegian customers to Oceania and Regent. But the same token, we\u2019ve got part of America out in Hawaii whose per diems are very similar to approaching the numbers that premium lines are getting and it\u2019s sometimes exceeding the premium line. And we think that, that product in many cases behaves more like an Oceania product than it might the rest of Norwegian fleet. And so we\u2019re going to be introducing some of the techniques in the Norwegian side, how we sell the Oceania brand. This idea that you book early because if not, prices are going to go up and you create a sense of scarcity of which they\u2019ve already naturally is because part of American Hawaii is - it has no competition as you know. So we just think that the board is littered with opportunities to really perhaps more so than in a typical M&A situations to adopt best practices. So if you have a business that\u2019s very similar in many ways but very different in some others. Brad Boyer : Perfect. Thanks guys. I appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim Conder : Thank you. Just wanted to circle back, if you could, Frank or Wendy. I appreciate the previous color on pricing on that, but if you could give a little bit more occupancy and pricing color by region across the quarters, if possible? And then secondly, Wendy on the fuel side, just maybe to understand a little bit of how the weighted average price of $525 a metric ton given that 60% or $520 [ph] and yet the pump you\u2019re using is $350. So a little of that and if there - and how much of a typical lag if that do you see with your fuel? Is it two, three weeks, four weeks from that perspective? Thank you. Wendy Beck : So, first off, we don\u2019t actually - I would say that this is really two different story this year. I mean, Q1 is driven largely by the pressures that we have in the Caribbean versus Q2, Q3 and Q4, all shaping up very nicely by all the brands. There is not an area that we\u2019re concerned about. Europe is shaping up, Alaska is shaping up. So we don\u2019t give a detailed color by the different regions, but it\u2019s looking good, and that\u2019s reflected in our guidance of the approximately 3%. Regarding the fuel, Tim. So we\u2019re at $350 for the full-year. Our fuel price per metric ton is approximately $350. And the net of hedges, it is $525. So we\u2019re looking at this $175 per metric ton is also there. And that\u2019s why we really wanted to carve this out. So you guys have clarity and color on the fact that, yes, we entered into the hedges and I probably should explain it, but as Norwegian stand-alone, we started out with a philosophy for hedging a minimum of 50%. But stand-alone, we tended to lean more towards hedging more and being opportunistic to have the certainty and the predictability within our earnings. Now with the addition of the Prestige brands, we will go back to a more classic strategy of probably 50% hedged. We are looking at hedges in the outer years right now. But we have a little bit more room instead of having to lock in that predictability on the financial side. So we also think it\u2019s very important to look at the underlying business and that\u2019s why we wanted to really get clarity here to say, okay, ex the hedges. The true operations is what we wanted to make sure you guys understood. Tim Conder : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Resources. Your line is now open. Assia Georgieva : Good morning. I had kind of a follow-up I guess to Tim\u2019s question. And Wendy maybe you can help me with this. I understand that for Q1, there are couple of effects; first of all the Caribbean and secondly maybe some hesitancy on the part of travel agents for the PCH brands. Do you think that this is a one-time item, or should we expect greater yield seasonality, weaker Q4 and Q1 in terms of both yield and DPS [ph], or should the Prestige brands actually help smooth out the weaker winter months that are typically the Caribbean for NCL? Wendy Beck : Great. Hi Assia. So as we had actually talked about on our previous earnings calls, we\u2019re rolling over a number of items in Q1. And we knew that it was going to be a tough lap in Q1. So on top of it being a promotional environment in the Caribbean, of course we hope that it would soften or strengthen I should say, it really hasn\u2019t - I mean, Q1 has I think been a tough quarter for all of our competitors and ourselves. But we are rolling over the Sochi charter from last year and that really was a huge premium for the Jade for roughly a month versus the winter mad, which is not strong pricing. The other item is the Bud Light charter. And then last year we had the maximum amount of charters on our for six-man group. We almost had the entire quarter actually chartered out on the parole. And so we\u2019re rolling over that this year. It\u2019s consistent of \u201915 to \u201914. So long story short, I think this is a one-time anomaly on Q1. I don\u2019t think that Q1 in general is going to be changes. It\u2019s the things we\u2019re rolling over. With Q4, we\u2019re starting to see the - we have a reduction in capacity at the same time that we bring in the Escape, the Epic is going to stay year around in Europe. So again we\u2019re feeling very optimistic and good about Q2, Q3 and Q4 including the Caribbean. Assia Georgieva : And relative to - I\u2019m sorry, Frank. Frank Del Rio : No, go head and finish. Assia Georgieva : Okay. Relative to basically a year ago given that we saw a little bit of slowdown in bookings and some acceleration more recently, do you feel more confident in the Q2 and Q3 outlook? Frank Del Rio : Well, I was doing pretty confident last year about this time before we had the situation in the Ukraine that had a dampening effect on European business. That situation has not corrected itself, but there is hope that the ceasefire will stick. And so we\u2019re seeing business pick up in the Baltic region and in the Northern Europe region a little bit. But yes, I am optimistic. I think businesses are booking well for Q2, Q3, Q4. And just as importantly in to \u201916. It\u2019s never too early to talk about the next year, and I will tell you that all three brands are better booked today for \u201916 than they\u2019ve ever been at this time of the year for the following year. And this in spite of the fact that we\u2019ve got more capacity at all three bands with new ship introduction. So I\u2019ve always believed that the cruise industry is a very strong leading economic indicator because of the long lead times, and the Prestige brands in particular, have much longer booking windows than what you see as the more contemporary brands like Norwegian. And so at this point, if I were an economist and a betting man, I would tell you that the outlook for 2016 and beyond is looking good right now. We have time for one more - thank you. We have time for one more question please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Joel Simkins : Good morning, everyone. Glad I was able to sneak on this. In terms of, I guess for Frank, you mentioned you\u2019re not really getting committed to anything on sort of capacity on this call, but could you just give us a sense of sort of how the cruise - the shipyards are communicating with you guys right now? Do you feel like there is an incremental capacity if you wanted to make more orders and are they - they seem to be a bit more hungry for orders, given what\u2019s going on in the energy sector? Frank Del Rio : There is always room for gello [ph] and there is always room for one more ship to be built. But I don\u2019t see the shipyards any more aggressive than they usually are. In fact, I will tell you that they are probably a little less aggressive in terms of pricing than they were in 2009, 2010 and the heels of the great recession. So it\u2019s pretty much a normal environment for the newbuilds. There was some issues with what\u2019s going to happen with the Finnish shipyard. It looks like it\u2019s been acquired by Meyer Werft. So that\u2019s good. We have a great relationship with Meyer Werft in Germany, who has been building the Norwegian ships for quite some time. We have a great relationship with Fincantieri who has built the two Oceania ships and is currently building Norwegian ship. So we have flexibility, and we will be able to drive a hard bargain when the time comes, because we do have these relationships with these two leading yards in the world. And of course, interest rates remain low. And for the time being at least the euro is low. So it is a good time to order ships if one was to be disposed to do that. Joel Simkins : Thank you. Frank Del Rio : And we\u2019re not right now. Joel Simkins : Okay. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Okay. Thanks everyone for your time and for your support. And as always, we\u2019ll be available to answer your questions after this call. I will see many of you hopefully next Wednesday in New York for our Investor Conference. Until then, have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you everyone. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy and good morning everyone. You recall it was not too long ago that we were announcing Norwegian\u2019s 2014 full year results and meeting many of you face-to-face at our investor conference in New York City. It was truly an exciting time as we had much to share with you.  First, the deal to acquire Prestige had closed a few months prior and the two previously separate Norwegian and Prestige organizations were starting to come together. At the same time, we implemented a corporate-wide organizational structure that balance brand champions and department heads tasked with maximizing revenue with leaders focused on keeping a keen eye on controlling costs. We created integration teams focused on quickly identifying and harvesting synergies across the organization. But most importantly, we began to lay out the strategies that would form the foundation for how my leadership team and I would leverage the size, brand positioning and expertise of our larger and more diversified company to ensure outsized future profitability growth.  An excellent foundation for growth had already been established at each of the previously separate organization. The Norwegian brand had completed a turnaround that was nothing short of remarkable and embarked on a disciplined newbuild program with six new innovative ships scheduled for delivery through 2019. All this, while reporting 26 consecutive quarters of earnings growth and continuing on its announced path of doubling return on invested capital since the time of its IPO. Prestige, meanwhile, continued to dominate the upscale cruise space generating the highest per diems and the highest EBITDA per berth in the industry, while at the same time planning for expansion of its market share in the luxury segment with the building of the Regent Seven Seas brand Explorer, the most luxurious cruise ship ever to be built and in the premium segment, with the addition of Serena, the fourth vessel in our award-winning R-class fleet.  Separately, Norwegian and Prestige were success stories in their own right but we can consider this past success as just the prelude of what is to come, now that the collective strengths of each organization are joined under one company.  We began with the quarter that just ended which marks the first full quarter of results following the combination of Norwegian and Prestige in November of 2014. And while there is a bit of noise due to the usual one-time items related to any acquisition, our results for the quarter already demonstrate the strong earnings power of our combined company.  But delivering this better-than-expected result is just part of the story for the quarter. While our leadership team continued to execute on the individual strategies that each company had in place prior to the combination, more importantly the team focused on working together to identify areas where we could demonstrate, quantify and implement initiatives which confirm that the new whole was much greater than the sum of its parts.  Throughout the first quarter and continuing through today, the excitement, optimism and camaraderie prevalent at our Miami headquarters is contagious. Throughout our campus, you will see employees from the Norwegian and Prestige organizations in the midst of co-locating, sharing and identifying each other\u2019s experiences and skills and building relationships with their new colleagues across the organization.  Our overriding mantra at Norwegian : three distinct brands in one incredible company and the culture of our organization reinforces that mantra. At the same time employees at the corporate level from vessel operations to revenue management to finance have the mindset of identifying best practices, leveraging our scale to achieve lower costs and utilizing technology and our combined knowledge base to drive demand to obtain the highest possible revenue. These new-found best practices will help form new playbooks for every area of the company. These playbooks will be key as my leadership team devote this first year of the combination to strengthening the foundation that would allow for outsized profit growth in the future. I devoted a lot of time to ensure that our organization was structured in such a way as to promote brand level as well as corporate wide excellence. That structure is further supported by the depth of talent and experience of our seasoned leadership team.  While planning for our record-breaking 2016, the team has not taken their eye off the ball for 2015 as demonstrated by our strong first-quarter results and improved earnings guidance, coupled with higher synergy targets for the remainder of the this and next year. At our investor day, we introduced you the various strategies that will drive our outsized long-term profit growth and pledged to continually to update you on our progress. As a quick refresher, the main components of our strategy -- which was coined as FDR's new deal, were, first, to execute on the solid strategies already in place; second, to drive higher per diems to deliver higher yields and lastly, to leverage scale to suppress costs.  Regarding executing on the strategies already in place, as I stated earlier, both the Norwegian and Prestige organizations were well down the road to success prior to the combination. The foundation of the new deal is to continue to successfully execute on those strategies that made each entity successful on its own but with measured adjustments and best practice learnings that come as a benefit of the combination, our new larger scale and a perspective that comes from a fresh look at each other's businesses will surely pay dividends.  One initiative of the first component of the new deal is to drive incremental organic earnings growth alongside rational capacity growth. For this initiative, we have looked across the fleet to identify areas where marginal changes that are commensurate with market conditions can be implemented to improve performance.  A few examples include a 6.7% average increase in beverage prices, the introduction of a nominal room service fee and lower cost from renegotiated shore excursion agreements. To put into perspective how these small changes can add up quickly, ever dollar increase in yield translates to approximately $15 million to the bottom line. These initiatives are still early in their stage but we clearly see additional opportunities in this area both in the short and long-term.  The second component of the new deal is to increase demand to drive higher per diems which lead to higher yields. While the execution of this component requires a delicate touch and will take time to fully develop, we are already seeing early signs of its success. This is evident in what is perhaps our most critical initiative, which is the implementation of elements of Prestige\u2019s proven and successful go-to-market strategy into Norwegian\u2019s pricing practices. We are beginning this initiative by first weaving into the mix Prestige\u2019s market-to-fill versus the more industry common discount to fill approach into the overall revenue management and planning philosophies for the Norwegian brand.  This strategy involves aggressive communication to consumers and travel agents to stimulate bookings by offering value pack rational pricing early in the selling cycle. The benefits of this strategy are many and it's a win-win for all parties. First for the target customer who knows their preferred voyage well in advance, they are rewarded with best price and state room availability. The same idea extends to travel partners. We want them to feel confident in recommending to their clients that if they booked their cruise further in advance of sailing, prices will not drop as the sailing draws closer, which assures higher commissions for themselves. Lastly, it benefits the cruise line by facilitating the building of a solid base of bookings which allows for price optimization as supply decreases.  To give you an indication of how much impact this market-to-fill strategy has had on our bookings so far, our combined company\u2019s booking window at the end of the first quarter was 172 days, up from 154 days at the end of Q1 201, or a 12% improvement. And while looking ahead to 2016, this strategy has significantly contributed to us having 39% more revenue on the book than we had for 2015 at the same time last year. These are truly impressive metrics and will contribute to consistent outsized yield growth. This strategy by definition also reduces the dissatisfier of close-in discounting-to-fill, which has been the bane of our industry.  Along with the concept of kicking off the sales cycles of attractive value pack introductory offers to encourage early bookings, the second prong of this market-to-fill strategy is meant to further wean guests from the practice of solely depending on price discounts by focusing consumers more on the overall value of the offered deals versus simply lower and lower pricing. As an example, this wave season Norwegian introduced an attractive value-add offer which we supported with additional marketing investment. The offer, dubbed Freestyle Choice, resulted in a record-breaking wave season for the Norwegian brand. The promotion was extremely well received by guests and travel agents alike, giving us optimism that the focus of our target customers is beginning to shift from a strictly price oriented one towards one that understands the overall value proposition of a cruise vacation.  We believe that our market-to-fill strategy coupled with compelling value-add promotions are a strong combination. And while these initiatives are in their early stages of implementation at the Norwegian brand, we can already see positive results as the brand continues to be better loaded in every quarter of 2015 versus the same time last year for 2014.  And for 2016, our book load factor has greatly improved and today it\u2019s approximately double what it was for 2015 at the same time last year, allowing for revenue management to optimize pricing throughout the sales cycle for the remaining inventory. Aside from rolling out certain onboard initiatives aimed at optimizing onboard revenue as well as our go-to-market strategy for the Norwegian brand, the first quarter saw a number of other initiatives and in the interest of time, I will just touch upon.  In the area of increasing demand which falls under the second deal component of improving net per diem, we announced an expansion of our Norwegian brand sales force which includes an increased presence in the important but underpenetrated markets of Canada and California. In addition, we have consolidated a UK sales office - offices of our three brands while in Germany, the Oceania and Regent sales teams will co-locate into the Norwegian brand\u2019s offices in Wiesbaden, allowing them to eliminate the costly GSAs and instead market and sell directly to travel partners and guests in this important market.  With a luxury sector that is as large as that of the UK, but a penetration by the Oceania and Regent brands that is much lower, having a dedicated in-house sales office for these brands in Germany is crucial to our brand\u2019s growth. The combination of our UK and German sales forces into joint offices follows the opening in late January of our sale, marketing and reservation center in Brazil which also represents Norwegian, Oceania and Regent brands in this growing BRIC market. Lastly, we are using our scale to suppress costs. Our management team has embarked on an all-out offensive to look at every aspect of the business that can benefit from our new larger scale. Significant inroads have been made in several areas, including port contracts, insurance, fuel and various other purchasing and provisioning initiatives.  Before turning the call over to Wendy, I\u2019d like to give you an update on the progress of our strategy identification and capture activities. Previously we had communicated the identification of $40 million of synergies for 2015, $15 million from revenue improvement and $25 million from cost savings, growing to an annual run rate of $50 million beginning in 2016. With additional time to assess their areas for further efficiencies, my leadership team in conjunction with our dedicated integration team have now identified total first-year synergies of $75 million with $30 million coming from incremental revenue and $45 million in cost-savings. Looking to 2016 and beyond, these same synergies combined with newly identified synergies result in $115 million in total synergies with more expected to come.  With six ships in the pipeline for delivery between now and 2019, creating and driving demand is the single most important initiative Norwegian\u2019s three brands can undertake. The scale of these incremental synergies provides the opportunity to earmark a portion for reinvestment, allowing us to boost our new deal strategies and other initiatives that drive demand, while at the same time allowing the majority of these synergies to flow to the bottom line for the benefit of our shareholders.  Of the incremental synergies identified, we are earmarking $20 million to be spent in 2015 with $40 million in 2016 for the Norwegian brand operational investments that we think will enhance the guest experience which leads to greater customer loyalty, that in turn drives demand. These reinvestments are crucial if we are to entice past guests to return more frequently and also lure a slightly more affluent and discerning first-time guests to Norwegian who will be willing to pay more to vacation aboard our fabulous ships.  While I can continue on regarding the host of other initiatives underway to further strengthen the foundation for Norwegian\u2019s long-term outsized profit growth, I don't want to overshadow this past quarter\u2019s significant accomplishments, including results which exceeded ours and the street\u2019s expectations and helped improve our outlook for the remainder of the year.  Advance sales in all three of our coming fleet additions are performing extremely well. Norwegian Escape which joins the fleet at the end of 2015 is on her way to a successful inaugural season. She is currently booked 10 times better than the Norwegian Getaway was at the same time prior to her delivery and overall much better than her other recent predecessor, Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Epic. Meanwhile Oceania Serena and Regent Seas Explorer have both led their respective brands to record booking days during Q1. There is lot of good news in the quarter. So I will turn the call over now to Wendy to discuss the results in more detail along with improved guidance for the year. Wendy? Wendy Beck : Thanks, Frank. I would like to begin by noting that unless otherwise stated the following commentary compares first quarter 2015 and 2014 on an as reported basis. You may recall that in our last earnings release, we provided guidance for changes in net yield and net cruise costs on an as reported basis as we customarily do. This as reported basis compares current year\u2019s reported results with those reported for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in the first quarter of 2014 results which occurred prior to the acquisition of Prestige Cruise Holdings.  In order to provide a better comparison of the combined company\u2019s true performance, we also provided guidance for net yield and net cruise costs which compares first quarter 2015 results for NCLH against the first quarter of 2014 which includes the results of Prestige. We refer to this guidance as combined company which we have provided on both an as reported and constant currency basis.  For first quarter 2015, the company generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.23 in the prior year and guidance of $0.20 to $0.24. Contributing to the earnings\u2019 beat were an outperformance in net yield and lower interest expense as a result of lower-than-expected interest rates and better grid pricing on certain credit facilities.  Adjusted net yield performance was better than anticipated, increasing 18.9% on an as reported basis as a result of a full quarter of consolidation of the upper premium and luxury Prestige brands. On a combined company basis, adjusted net yield decreased a slight 0.7% compared to guidance of down 1% to 2% and was essentially flat on a constant currency basis. These results are even more impressive as they come against the strong first quarter of 2014 where net yield increased 3.8% for the Norwegian brands and included two high yielding charters for Norwegian Jade at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi and Norwegian Getaway in New York for the festivity surrounding the Super Bowls.  In addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an expected impact in the quarter. While we saw a slowdown in onboard spend from European guests on the Norwegian brand, overall guest spend improved on the Oceania and Regent brands particularly for shore excursion and pre and post hotel stays. We expect exchange rates to continue to be a net headwind and we have included their expected impact in our guidance which I'll discuss later in my commentary.  Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, increased in the period by 28.7% on an as reported basis, mainly due to the addition of the Prestige brand and 5.6% on a combined company basis. The increasing cost can be attributed to timing of certain expenses, including the receipt of technical spares as well as additional marketing investments, including return to television for the Norwegian brand which we frontloaded into the early part of the year to take advantage of wave season and build a strong base of bookings for 2015 and beyond.  Regarding net cruise costs, I would like to point out one item which appears in our non-GAAP adjustments for this metric. This item is a $9.1 million benefit pertaining to the accounting of the contingency payment of $50 million to be payable to shareholders of Prestige Cruise Holdings prior to the acquisition, pursuant to the achievement of certain performance metrics in 2015. Accounting for this contingency is similar to a mark-to-market instrument with the value being adjusted based on the probability of achievement.  The contingency payment is in two thresholds. The first threshold with a payout of 50% is based on 98% achievement of the target metric. The second threshold payout of the remaining 50% is contingent on achieving the remaining 2% of the target metric. But given the narrow band of the second threshold, small changes in the probability of achievement result in large swings in the contingency recorded.  Now turning back to costs and fuel in particular, our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges in the period decreased 18.3% to $526 from $643 in the prior year. As with the prior quarter, we experienced a negative impact from our fuel hedge portfolio as a result of lower oil prices in the period. Excluding the impact of hedges, our at-the-pump fuel price per metric ton was $401 compared to $646 in 2014, representing a 37.9% decrease. The difference in the hedged versus non-hedged fuel price per metric ton in 2015 results in a $0.09 per share impact on adjusted EPS. Interest expense net was $51 million compared to $31.2 million in 2014 on account of higher debt balances resulting from the acquisition of Prestige, offset by the aforementioned lower than expected interest rates and improvement in grid pricing on certain of our credit facilities due to improved leverage metrics.  Other income expense in the quarter included an expense of $29 million for a foreign currency collar related to a ship construction contract. At the time of the drafting of our prior guidance, we anticipated this collar would be designated as a cash flow hedge and thus receive hedge accounting treatment. The structure of the collar is such that it will not be eligible for hedge accounting treatment, thus we expect future impact of this line item on it is marked to market on a quarterly basis.  Now looking to \u201915, we\u2019ve provided guidance along with associated sensitivity for the second quarter and full year 2015 in our earnings release. In addition to providing guidance on an as reported basis for net yield and net cruise costs, we are also providing guidance of this metric against 2014 combined company results as the basis with which to compare 2015 expectations.  As stated earlier, these combined company results assume the consolidated results of Norwegian and Prestige for the second-quarter and full-year 2014 as of the beginning of that year. In terms of impacts to the balance of the year, Norwegian Star underwent an unscheduled drydock in April to replace propeller bearings which malfunctioned after a recent scheduled drydock in the first quarter. While the cost of the drydock is minimal as the repairs are covered under warranty, the revenue impact of the cancellation of a 15-day Panama Canal sailing is more pronounced and is included in our guidance. Lastly, we expect to continue to experience the headwinds from a stronger dollar on foreign currency denominated sales. Offsetting these impacts are the benefits from incremental revenue synergies and business initiatives identified in the quarter. As a result, we are maintaining our full-year adjusted net yield guidance of approximately 17.5% on an as reported basis for results compared to those filed by the company for full-year 2014 and introducing constant currency guidance of approximately 19%. On a combined company basis, we expect adjusted net yield to be up approximately 1.5% and 3% on an as reported and constant currency basis respectively.  Turning to costs, the additional investment of $20 million for projects and initiatives aimed at driving demand are offset by an equal amount of incremental identified synergies, resulting in our adjusted net cruise costs ex fuel to remain unchanged at up approximately 23.5% on an as reported basis while on a constant currency basis, we expect an increase of approximately 24%.  On a combined company basis, we expect an increase of approximately 2.75% and 3.25% on an as reported and constant currency basis respectively. The benefits of interest savings for the balance of the year will be offset with higher depreciation expense as a result of additional capital investments stemming from the new deal program and its goal of enhancing the guest experience to drive higher per diems. That said, interest savings and better than anticipated net yield performance in the first quarter along with maintaining our net yield and new cruise cost guidance has resulted in raising the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $2.75 to $2.90.  Guidance for the second quarter, where the impact of the Norwegian Star unscheduled drydock is most pronounced, particularly in terms of net yield, are as follows. On an as reported and content currency basis, we expect adjusted net yield for the second quarter of 2015 to grow in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% and 19.5% to 20.5% respectively.  On a combined company basis, we expect adjusted net yield to increase between 1% to 2% on an as reported basis and 2.5% to 3.5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity days, on an as reported basis, is expected to increase between 23% and 24% and 23.5% to 24.5% on a constant currency basis. On a combined company basis, we expect a decrease of 2.25% and 3.25% on an as reported basis and 2% to 3% in constant currency. Lastly, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.75.  Now turning to deployment, the second quarter sees much of our fleet in repositioning voyages. Now in order to demonstrate the benefits of diversification from the addition of the Oceania Cruises and Regent fleets, the following compares 2015 deployment on a combined basis to 2014 on a Norwegian brand only basis. 29% of capacity is in the Caribbean in 2015 compared to 38% in 2014. Europe deployment increases to 27% from 23% for the quarter while Alaska increases 200 basis points to 12%.  And Asia, Africa, Pacific, South America and world cruises which were areas where the company had no presence in 2014 now combined to account for 4% of capacity with the addition of Prestige\u2019s fleet.  With that, I will turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy. As I mentioned earlier, the excitement of Norwegian's prospects and those of our three brands is resonating with our travel agent partners, our valued past guests and throughout the organization as we continue to work for a great 2015 and ready ourselves for another year of outsized profit growth in 2016.  Both Oceania and Regent will welcome fleet additions in 2016 that will further solidify the places -- their places in the upscale cruise space. And not to be outdone, the Norwegian brand will continue its history of innovation with a full year of sailings of its large ship Norwegian Escape, the introduction of a semi-all-inclusive experience on its three and four night Bahamas product onboard Norwegian Sky and will begin the planning for the arrival in 2017 of the Norwegian Bliss.  On the synergy front, we expect that on our next earnings call we will communicate the final tally from our formal synergy identification and implementation efforts that will transition to a new phase of our combined operations where we turn from identifying savings solely as a result of the combination but instead focus on broader opportunities that arise from day-to-day operations. We are working hard on all aspects of the business to bring our shareholders superior profit growth and investment returns. We continue to lead the industry in net yield, EBITDA margin and return on invested capital, and if the year continues as planned, we will have double our adjusted earnings per share in just two years.  It\u2019s a great start to our first full quarter of combined results and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you all for your continued support. We\u2019d like to go ahead and open up the lines for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Brad Boyer : Hey thanks guys. This is actually Brad in for Steve. First off, on the $30 million in identified revenue synergies, and perhaps what comes beyond, can you kind of give some color around how you see that shaking out between ticket and onboard? Wendy Beck : So first off, I don't want to give too much color but I would say the majority of it goes to onboard and net shore ex. And the smaller portion goes to be ticket side but that\u2019s the opportunity and so that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s the FDR deal that\u2019s not baked into our guidance, it\u2019s not baked into our long-term target for \u201817 that we put out there and I think, Frank, do you want to speak a little more to that? Frank Del Rio : Yes, as you recall at the investor conference, one of the drivers of the so-called FDR deal is how do you increase demand which in turn increases per diems which leads to higher yield. And that\u2019s a longer -- longer evolving initiative, it\u2019s already taken hold. I gave you a couple of tidbits of information of how well we are booked into the rest of \u201815 and into \u201916. And when you are booked that well, when your load factor is double what it was the same time last year for 2016, unless you're totally asleep at the wheel, which we are not, prices per diem will go up. And so we see various initiatives that will increase our ability to increase yields at a higher clip, at a faster clip than historical averages. We\u2019re not ready to obviously give you a whole lot of color and specifics around what we expect yields to be in 2016. We reiterated yield guidance for the rest of \u201815 but if the booking load factors are as good as we were saying they are, you know what\u2019s going to come next. And that is better price. Brad Boyer : And then on the second topic, since you last talked to us, a number of your competitors have announced kind of expanded plans and aspirations for the Chinese market. Just wanted to see if we could get an update on your thinking long-range around the China opportunity. Frank Del Rio : Well, what appears to be every ship in the world is going to China, maybe the rest of the world is a bigger opportunity now in China. I say that only tongue-in-cheek but it is incredible to see our competitors devoting their newest largest, probably their best performing ships to the Chinese market. We have launched the study group that we said we were going to launch back in the investor day conference, we have hired a very seasoned executive who has gone through the process of opening up China for one of our competitors. And so we believe that having him on board with his expertise will quickly increase our overall knowledge of that market. Harry Sommer who now has been our chief integration officer, as soon as the integration efforts are complete by the end of Q2 will transition and lead that effort. And so we've got quite a bit of talent dedicated to that study group. I, of course, will oversee it and we\u2019re still very bullish on China as the rest of the industry seems to be as well. So no real specifics at this time, as I mentioned at the investor conference, we expect to complete our work by year-end and be able to share it with you shortly thereafter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry Curtis : I've got a couple of questions. Turning to your incremental reinvestments, can you give us a sense of what you are investing in and why? What is the strategy behind what you're trying to do with the incremental money that you are setting aside? And then have you assumed any impact on yield as a result of that investment? Frank Del Rio : The main driver is to increase demand. All of our three brands are taking on additional tonnage over the next few years as I mentioned in my opening comments. And so the most important initiative that any company can undertake is to make sure that you build that capacity coming online. And so a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing is to do everything we can to generate more demand, and part of that is through sales and marketing efforts. You recall that very early in my tenure in Q1 we announced that we were going to increase the sales force to penetrate the under-performing Canadian and California markets for the Norwegian brand and we were going to do more work on the international arena that the Oceania and Regent brands had penetrated the international marketplace a little bit more effectively than Norwegian had up to now. And quite a bit of that money being spent is to do just that, a more pronounced presence in important markets and with the marketing spend that goes with entering those markets. The second part of the reimbursement is to make the onboard product better, to increase guest satisfaction. If you have happy customers, they are more likely to come back more frequently than if you have unhappy customers. So the Norwegian product is already very good but we want to make it the best it can possibly be and the industry-leading in our space. And so all the monies being spent on the product side are being spent on the Norwegian brand specifically. We\u2019re very happy with the product \u2013 onboard product of the Oceania and Regent brands but we do think that the Norwegian brand could improve from where it is today. Harry Curtis : Then that leads to my second question is it's been three months since \u2013 Frank Del Rio : By the way, Harry, I didn't answer your second part of your question is that there is absolutely no benefit baked into many of the numbers that we disclosed today, whether it is for \u201815 or \u201916. And so we hope that these $20 million initiatives in \u201915 and $40 million in \u201816 will lead to a greater demand which will in turn lead to higher per diems and higher yields but we\u2019re assuming for the moment that we\u2019re going to incur the cost and not reap any of the benefits. So we\u2019re being very conservative with this reinvestment program. Harry Curtis : Very good. And that leads to the next question, which is longer-term. You have made comments about the earnings power of Norwegian perhaps doubling by the end of 2017. It's been three months since you publicly commented on that. Has anything changed in the last three months to make your ability to achieve that goal more or less likely? Frank Del Rio : I just want to correct, I think that the comments we made was that by 2017 earnings-per-share would hit $5. And you recall that was against the context at the time of basically the plan that had been in place prior to my arrival, which had included $50 million of synergies. So what we know today \u2013 two or three months later, the synergies now are greater than $50 million. Everything that I see at Norwegian from a structural perspective, from a brand perspective, I believe there is improvements that we can achieve whether you want to categorize them as synergies or categorize them as just good old business opportunities that had been neglected, or not been fully exploited, I believe that\u2019s the case. So I believe that $5 is -- I feel stronger today than I did three months ago that the $5 if not more is achievable. A bit too early to quantify how much more. So I don\u2019t want to get into what we\u2019re going to be doing in \u201917 because we haven\u2019t gone through \u201816 yet. But there is no reason to believe that those numbers are somewhat conservative at this point. Wendy Beck : And I would just add that we had baked $50 million into the \u201816 synergy number to get to the $5 and so with the net 75 that we put out in our earnings release, that\u2019s an additional 25 million upside to the $5. Operator : Thank you and our next quarter is from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : A couple of questions. Frank, in your opening remarks, and you talked about a 39% increase in revenue on the books for \u201816 versus the same time last year, is that a pro forma number? I just want to think about the scale of that number. Is that pro forma, or is that -- because Prestige would not have been on the books at this time last year? \u2013 Frank Del Rio : No, it is apples to apples. We took what Prestige had in the books at this time last year for \u201815 and added the two numbers together. So it is a good number. Robin Farley : And then can you give us a little color -- maybe this is a question for Wendy -- on the pro forma increase in ticket yields versus the percent increase in onboard yields in kind of a constant-currency basis? Just because there's not enough information released to see what that would look like pro forma constant currency. Wendy Beck : Robin, we don't actually break out the ticket versus onboard in our guidance. I mean that\u2019s a combined number. But what I can tell you is based on the synergies that we saw roughly two-thirds is going towards onboard and one towards ticket. And the upside or the opportunity for us is to continue to push on the ticket side. Robin Farley : But I was \u2013 it sounds just like the actual, Q1 actual? Wendy Beck : On Q1, yes, 75% I would say is ticket and the way that \u2013 that actually skews more towards Norwegian and then the onboard upside really skews more towards Oceania and Regent. Robin Farley : But with the flat pro forma net yield for Q1, does that -- if you said most of that was ticket, does that mean that ticket was up slightly, and maybe onboard was down slightly? Wendy Beck : Yes, so if you go back \u2013 when we put out our Q3 earnings call we actually said at that time that we had hoped that Q1 would be up -- either flat to up 1% and then we guided down but as we went into the quarter we were up high on our per diems but we were actually down on our load. And that was one of the first changes that was made here with the new management team, was let\u2019s get loaded and then once we get it loaded, we will start increasing the revenue and we changed the marketing initiative, that we talked about this at investor day, we changed the deal, we had an enticing ad but we changed to even more call to action less branding and so that resulted in upside in the ticket for Norwegian. Frank Del Rio : Yes and that\u2019s why we are excited, yes, for the second half of \u201815 and really into \u201816 because the necessary condition in my view of being able to raise prices and per diems and therefore yields is load factor. And when your book is well booked into the future as we are at this point, that bodes very well for constant increases in prices. Robin Farley : And then just my last question is just can you clarify what's the deferred revenue that -- it's in your -- you have a line item, adjusted yield, and it looks like it adds about 400 basis points to yield on a reported basis. So I'm just wondering, first of all, can you clarify what that is that you are adjusting? And then, also, how much did it add to your pro forma net yield? In other words, pro forma net yield was basically flat in the quarter. Would it also have been down 4% -- just to understand what that adjustment is? Wendy Beck : So this is related to the acquisition of Prestige and it\u2019s under the business combination accounting rules. So obviously we booked revenue when the ship sails but advance ticket sales, it was about $48 million in total, that is deemed that the sailing process had primarily occurred at the time of the acquisition. And so therefore you have to actually haircut that number and so we actually are adjusting out to 21 million because we are putting it back in, just say, this is real revenue that you need to look at for that selling. But because of the accounting rules they make you haircut it. And that was already baked into our guidance. We were discussing that at the last call. Robin Farley : That $21 million, under the accounting rules, it will show up in later quarters? Or in other words, are they sailings that -- Wendy Beck : That\u2019s correct. Robin Farley : So those were sailings that hadn't been taken yet or something? Wendy Beck : So we are going to see it for the rest of the year and it will go consistently down over the next three quarters. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : Just to finish up on that question that Robin just asked, because we had the same one -- did that $20 million of deferred revenues or so, does it go $20 million to $10 million to $5 million to $5 million? Because it does influence the cadence of the net yield, which obviously we all focus in on. That's one question. Then the second question is just on -- same thing, on cadence of your fuel costs. Fuel price per metric ton probably goes up from first quarter to the second quarter, but fuel price per metric ton seems to be lower in your guidance. So I'm trying to understand that. Is that related to the fuel hedges? Wendy Beck : Okay good question. So on the deferred revenue, there is about $18 million to $19 million remaining for the last three quarters. And then that will go away. And then regarding the fuel prices, yes, so our fuel prices do actually spike up in Q2 and Q3 as we are moving into the more premium itineraries or burning more NGLs and then it\u2019s going to go back down into the fourth quarter. You will see that lower back down to get us back to our full year guidance. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Frank and Wendy, really appreciate all the detail you provided in the prepared remarks, and so far in the Q&A. I'm just wondering, can you update us more specifically about what you're seeing in your various markets in 2015, Caribbean, Europe, Alaska, perhaps some details on pricing on bookings, and if you have seen any changes since your first-quarter guidance in those markets? Frank Del Rio : From that perspective, it\u2019s been pretty steady. There isn\u2019t any markets that are \u2013 that distinguish themselves either on the high end or the low end. If there is a market that shows a little weakness and I think it\u2019s some leftover fears of the Ebola virus and some of the more exotic itineraries on the Oceania and Regent fleet that touch the African continents and go out to Asia. There is a little weakness there. The good news is that\u2019s a very, very small part of our overall deployment but you issue itineraries a year and half, three years ahead of the actual sailing. So if I had to do all over again I may not have as many sailings in and out of Cape Town, Africa. But they are coming back a bit, I think, as the headline and all the negative news stories about Ebola start to fade in and the world is not coming to an end because of Ebola. But if there was one that I would tell you had a little bit of weakness, it would be that but overall Europe is strong, Alaska is strong, the Caribbean is very good. I mentioned to you how well Escape is going and Escape is a Caribbean ship out of Miami. So when you are booked as well as we are booked into the future given the diversification of itineraries by definition, the areas are all doing pretty well. Felicia Hendrix : And then also, Frank, thank you. I know you are very focused on customer satisfaction. I think that goes without saying. You've talked earlier about raising your beverage pricing and your room service fees. I'm just wondering if those efforts have affected consumer satisfaction at all and what kind of feedback has Norwegian gotten from that, if any? Frank Del Rio : On the beverage, we\u2019ve seen nothing at all. We have not seen a decrease in consumption. It\u2019s pretty much what we thought, if you are thirsty around the pool, and you want a Pepsi in the middle of the ocean, you\u2019re going to buy that Pepsi whether it\u2019s $2.10 which was the old price, or $2.25 which is a new price, so nothing at all. On the more recent introduction of a fleet-wide $7.95 service charge on room service, if you read some of the online blogs, there has been some comments, there always is, no one likes to pay more. But we tested it on two ships in two different price points and we didn\u2019t hear complaints. We improved the menus, so there was a give and take. So yes, you have to pay a delivery charge so that we can deliver faster, because that eliminates some of the folks who order a piece of toast on a cup of coffee in the morning and \u2013 but no, overall, all these initiatives that we have put in place that recognize the power of the captive audience that you have without going too far, they\u2019ve all panned out as we expected. Felicia Hendrix : And then just quick housekeeping. Wendy, can you just update us, if there is an update from your investor day on the FX sensitivities to yield and/or EPS? Wendy Beck : Sure. It\u2019s the same sensitivities actually that we had. So let\u2019s see \u2013 it\u2019s three-tenths of a penny, count to two-tenths Canadian, three-tenths and then Australian two-tenths that\u2019s gaining. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Jamie Katz : The $5 that you guys are looking at in 2017 not only implies that you can capture some pricing growth, but also that net cruise costs, capacity-adjusted, are extremely well contained. And I think this quarter, like-for-like they were up about 5.6%, it indicated in the press release. So can you just sort of speak to your confidence level on the ability to maintain those costs and really where you see the best opportunity is to keep those costs under control? Wendy Beck : First off, Jamie, we don\u2019t have in $5. Any upside of FDR new deal into the revenue side of the business. I just want to say if you look back at what I just talked about with the long term outlook, that\u2019s pretty much a 3% to 4% net yield growth baked into that year. So to the extent that these things start to take place and take a foot hold, that\u2019s upside to the $5.  And regarding the net cruise costs, I can just say in my role here, we are just as focused on net cruise costs as we always have been. This is an anomaly year, primarily an organic year, we don\u2019t get the benefit of a new ship until the back end of the year and we already are putting a number of investments into marketing to really bolster the marketing where we believe remains to be and that\u2019s both pre-Frank coming on-board and then post-Frank coming on board, saying, okay, I need to tweak it even more. I will turn it to you, Frank. Frank Del Rio : Yes, but as a general comment, I will tell you that I truly believe that whether you want to consider them formal synergies as I said we need to transition away from just looking at the combination as an opportunity for cost savings and transition to running a business period. We are not done at all on the synergy cost capture. Again we have been here four months now and have found \u2013 what we have found nearly $200 million in total but we are not done. Not going to tell you how much more we think we can get but it\u2019s not de minimis. So we are going to continue to focus on costs. There\u2019s lots of more opportunities. We hinted at our investor conference what we thought we could achieve on the back office, on payroll if you will and we hit the top end. Baked into the synergy number for 2016, for example, is a $27 million of headcount reduction and was roughly 10% of our payroll. And we think we are pretty much done there but there are many pockets \u2013 in a company that generates $4.5 billion worth of revenue and makes $500 million of the profit, it\u2019s $4 billion of expenses and there is just more to get. So none of that \u2013 none of those costs above the $50 million in net synergies that are baked into the $5 in 2017 or the $3.71 I believe in 2016, zero upside to pricing to yields is baked in, whether you want to call it the FDR deal or just the fact that we are still well booked into the future and what\u2019s going to happen next is you are going to see pricing steadily increasing as a result of that strong load factor. None of those factors, both which are positive, are embedded in the $5 in 2017 EPS estimate. And so again I don\u2019t want to start adding A plus B equals C but at this point the $5 is a very well in our focus and it should exceed \u2013 the actual results should exceed that $5 target. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Greg Badishkanian : So I mean really good to hear that you are so well booked. And the 39% year-over-year increase in revenues for 2016 on the books, and then you compare that with the load factor at double, the primary difference there? And then, also, typically at this point in the year, if you don't want to give the specific number right now, but typically, how much of the forward year do you have on the books, just to see the magnitude of how important those numbers are? Frank Del Rio : Still low, I won\u2019t give you a number. But any time you are that far ahead is good. Greg Badishkanian : And the 39% versus the 2 times load factor -- the difference there, what the big difference is there? Frank Del Rio : Difference is that the 39% encompasses all three brands and the double in load factor in Norwegian only. Greg Badishkanian : And then finally, just on -- Royal, obviously, as you listen to your competitor earnings calls -- talked about the policy of stopping last-minute discounting. Has that had any impact on you? And have you noticed any change in behavior of some of the -- I guess it would just be Carnival, since there is not a lot of other big players out there. But have you noticed any differences in the competitive landscape responding to that? Frank Del Rio : I don\u2019t know what Carnival is doing. I heard what Royal was going and I applaud them. No one likes to see discounts. We think that our go-to-market strategy while eliminating discounts, it certainly minimizes the need for discount because if you are again booked this far in advance like we are, the pricing dynamic is want to increase pricing and not to decrease pricing. So if we are successful at rolling out what we say we are going to do and by definition, the need for massive last minute discounting goes away. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Tim Conder : Just a few more here. Wendy, could you maybe give us a little more color on the impact of the unplanned resumed drydock here due to the warranty issue on yield and cost? And then is there any possible recovery for business interruption insurance, either yours or be borne by the yard? Wendy Beck : That\u2019s a great question and obviously once we look into \u2013 so the good news is that the drydock cost is minimal. Our cost is less than $1 million on that because it\u2019s being covered under warranty. The bigger item is the lost revenue and that\u2019s in the mid single digit million that we\u2019ve actually lost on that 15-day Panama Canal sailing. Tim Conder : And then you would have some cost avoidance, also. You are not burning fuel, or -- but I guess you are still obviously paying the crew -- Wendy Beck : There is, Tim but on the same token, when we cancelled that sailing, we hauled tail if you will, to the Bahamas from the West Coast to get there to minimize any disruption before we did the Transatlantic. So it\u2019s an offset. Tim Conder : And then Frank, again, early days, but you and the rejuvenated team here -- great, great performance. Given the discussion that's happened here so far with the incremental net cost savings after reinvestments, and then how that's been some additional opportunities that you had but have not yet quantified, and the impact going forward here, could you or Wendy just maybe update us on your thoughts on the debt prepay? I think you\u2019d talked about pre-paying a certain amount of debt beginning in \u201816 and how that was a little bit factored into your guidance. But then maybe balancing that versus share repo, is that still looking at 2016? Wendy Beck : Great question. And we are very focused on that and including our board as to what\u2019s the best use of our free cash flow. And what I said at investor day is that probably or there is likelihood that in the fourth quarter of \u201915 we could start to either pay down some debt or go back and start \u2013 embark again on our share repurchase program. And I would say that we are still very focused on that. So it\u2019s either late \u201915 or into \u201916, I think that\u2019s what we are focused on. What I also stated was that there is more of an appetite with our weighted average cost of debt being just over 3.7%, we are inclined that share repurchases is more likely the better use of funds. And we are excited about that. So that\u2019s highly likely, obviously it has not been approved by our board at this time but we are focused on that. Tim Conder : And lastly, Frank, I know this is a board decision, but you\u2019d also talked about maybe initiating a dividend. And would that be reasonable to assume that you would maybe want to do that earlier than later, just to broaden out the investor base here? Wendy Beck : Let me jump in and take that, Tim. I think it was the one that addressed that at the investor day. And it\u2019s not that necessarily \u2013 I think what we said all along is that it\u2019s a matter of time before a dividend is implemented. And we know that we want to broaden that investor base. But it hasn\u2019t been the primary focus. We are probably more keen on repurchasing shares first but again that\u2019s a good discussion at our board level and I do think it is a matter of time. Operator : Thank you and our last question is from Stuart Gordon with Berenberg. Stuart Gordon : A couple of questions. Just the first one on the yield, just looking at what you delivered in the first quarter, above the top end of what you'd expected in the quarter. And then your commentary on the outlook seems extremely bullish. I was just curious as to why yield guidance wouldn't have been lifted on the back of this? Is it just Star going in for the drydock, or what's your thoughts there? And the second thing is -- is there anything you can say about Cuba, given obviously we have seen the ferry service getting introduced; JetBlue. Where is the cruise industry in discussions on opening up Cuba? Frank Del Rio : Well Cuba is of a special interest to me, not only because I run a cruise line but because I was born in Havana and haven\u2019t been back in 54 years. So it\u2019d be nice to go back. Look, I have said publicly Cuba was tailor-made for the cruise industry given where it is, given the pent-up demand that there has to be for Cuba after being closed to Americans and for most of the world for all these years. I will tell you that I welcome the initiatives that both governments have undertaken to resume discussions and resume a normal relations between the two countries, literally a week doesn\u2019t go by some news comes out about making progress towards that goal. I think you saw this week where the administration approved four ferry companies to start ferry service to Cuba. I think that\u2019s all positive steps. Obviously we need to go further. I don\u2019t think that both countries want to stop where we are and so we are hopeful that progress continues and that some day not in the distant future, cruising to Cuba will be allowed. It will be a great boon to the industry and coupled with what we are seeing in China this can be the start of another golden boom in the cruise industry, where you\u2019ve got new destinations to go to that are very sought after in Cuba and a whole new market, a large new market in China that wants to cruise. It could be heck of a 1Q punch to really increase overall demand for cruising. In terms of yields, could you repeat the question, please? Stuart Gordon : Yes, it just seems to be -- I think you were above the top end of the first-quarter guidance with yields. And clearly, the commentary and the reinvestment that you're making is all -- sounds extremely positive. But I was curious why I think you've left the full-year guidance where it was. Is it really simply down to the enforced drydock of the Star or are you just being extremely conservative despite the good start to the year? Wendy Beck : Great question. So yes, we did have a beat in revenue on Q1 but it\u2019s a combination not only of the Star drydock that I just spoke about but then also the additional FX hit that we\u2019re going through that at this time we anticipate will hit us for the year. That\u2019s why we have left the yields where they are but we have said that the upside from the FDR new deal plan is baked into those numbers and it takes time to roll out those initiatives. So we feel very confident that they will be fully in place for \u201916 but we think that there could be potential upside in \u201915 too and we will just have to continue to message that to you.  End of Q&A Frank Del Rio : Thanks everyone for your time and support today. As always, we\u2019ll be available later this afternoon to answer any questions you may have. Operator, thank you for your good work. Good by everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer, and instructions for that session will follow at that time. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow with commentary on the results for the quarter as well as provide updated guidance for 2015, before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website, at www.nclhltdinvestor.com, and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.

I would also like to review information about forward-looking statements and the use of the non-GAAP information as a part of this call. The company's comments today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations. The company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates and will undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see the company's SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in the company's earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. The overall theme for the second quarter of 2015 is that the various initiatives that we've shared with you over the past few months have taken hold in our bearing strong positive results. As I mentioned on our last call, our first full quarter as a combined company, our priorities were two-fold. First was ensuring that we came out of the gates strong in our first combined quarter to set a positive tone for the newly combined company. On that front, we can say mission accomplished, as we posted strong earnings for Q1. Second and, perhaps, most importantly was building the foundation to successfully bring the Norwegian and Prestige organizations together under one company. We created a motto for all stakeholders to rally around it, three distinct brands, one incredible company. This motto firmed the basis for how we structured our organization. On one side, our brand champions focused on stimulating demand to drive yields through sales and marketing initiatives. On the other, our areas with centralized responsibilities, including vessel operations, supply chain, revenue management and finance, all of which focus on maximizing our resources and capital allocation to drive further synergies and efficiencies. This flat organizational structure is one of Norwegian's main differentiators in the cruise space. Another differentiator is our portfolio of brands, positioned in the contemporary, upper premium, and luxury segments of the market, there is minimal overlap among them, meaning we do not compete against ourselves in the marketplace. All in all, we believe that our organizational structure and brand mix both of which are unique in the cruise industry, our core strengths that are and will continue to deliver outside dividends in the future. Turning back to the combination of the Norwegian and Prestige organizations, the integration is now substantially complete and we are seeing a strong positive results expected. Over the last few months, team members from both organizations have been collaborating on everything from purchasing to systems integrations, to sharing sales and marketing strategies, all in an effort to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. This is evident in our synergy capture initiative. With the majority of integration efforts substantially complete, we are reiterating our 2015 synergy target of $75 million, comprised of $30 million in revenue and $45 million in cost synergies of which $20 million is being reinvested into the business this year. For 2016, we have identified an additional $10 million in synergies, raising the total to $125 million for the year, split about evenly between revenue and cost synergies. $40 million of the $125 million remains earmarked for reinvestment in various business initiatives aimed at driving yields across our three brands to continue building momentum for what we believe will be a breakout year in 2016. Along with an increase in identified synergies, each of our brand has launched various initiatives during the quarter aimed at bolstering revenue for 2016 and beyond. On our last call, I discussed weaving the Oceania and Regent market-to-fill strategies into the Norwegian brand along with changing the conversation with consumers from one focused on low prices to one focused on high value. This time I'd like to focus on another related strategy, that being creating scarcity of offerings to drive higher yields. Looking at the Norwegian brand, just yesterday, we announced one of our most ambitious and diverse itinerary offerings in recent years. This diversified deployment is another example of exchanging of best practices between brands. In this case, we are weaving in the concept of itinerary scarcity that has proven successful at Oceania and Regent into the Norwegian deployment strategy. This concept involves diversifying itineraries not only for repositioning voyages, but more importantly for seasonal and year-round regional and homeport deployments. Itinerary scarcity breaks up the glut of repetitive sailings or milk runs that in essence tend to commoditize voyages in a given deployment. Whereas in the past, the Norwegian brand focused on freedom, flexibility and choice in the on-board experience, we are now taking these important attributes and expanding them to be in the destination experience as well. The following are a couple of examples to demonstrate this new itinerary development concept. First is diversification of offerings with an entirely new group of itineraries. Using the expertise of the Oceania and Regent itinerary development team, we've crafted a deployment plan for Norwegian Star to begin sailing to Asia and Australia targeting Western guests. For years the Norwegian brand has received appeals from loyal guests to offer sailings in the Australia-Asia region. Echoing this sentiment is a fairly vociferous and growing group of Australians and New Zealanders who have sailed on Norwegian ships in other parts of the world and who have requested time and time again that we bring our unique Freestyle offering down under. Norwegian Star's seasonal deployment will satisfy both contingents and mark the brand's return to the region after a 15-year absence. This new deployment also coincides with the ramping up of our sales and marketing operations in Australia which I'll discuss later in the call, and replaces our lowest yielding seven-day product. Star's new deployment is one of the most exciting for the Norwegian brand in recent years. During our repositioning and deployment, Norwegian Star will call on several ports in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australia, and New Zealand, including Copenhagen, Barcelona, Istanbul, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sydney, and Auckland. The second example is one of diversification of itineraries in some of Norwegian's most popular homeports. In the past, Norwegian was known for having almost exclusively seven-day identical and repetitive sailings or again, milk runs from certain ports, resulting in weeks and weeks of supply with no differentiation. With this new deployment, we have sought to slowly and methodically diversify our offerings while re-energizing homeports that have proven popular. A perfect example is Norwegian Jade which will be deployed to Tampa beginning in October of 2016. Along with her base itinerary of seven-day Western Caribbean voyages, we have added a variety of 8-, 10-, and 11-day voyages to the Eastern and Western Caribbean, which will call on new ports not previously serviced by Norwegian from Tampa. We have done the same with Norwegian Spirit which will be to redeploy to Europe year-round beginning in November of 2016, but this time offering a variety of 7-, 10-, and 11-day Eastern and Western Mediterranean voyages departing from Barcelona, Venice, and Istanbul. As a contemporary product, we fully understand that the Norwegian brand is positioned differently in a marketplace and as such is not expected to reach the same level of diversification that Oceania or Regent enjoys. It is our job to find the right balance between consistency and diversification of offering in order to maximize yields. What we do know is that the Norwegian customer wants to see the world as much as an Oceania or Regent customer does, and we continue to evaluate other opportunities to offer our guests a broader portfolio of destinations. Looking at Oceania, we recently rolled out a new marketing campaign called O Life Advantage (11:10). This booking initiative reinforces Oceania's longstanding message to its guests, which is to book their 2016 vacations early by offering a collection of Oceania's most popular incentives in one simplified program across the fleet, including Oceania's newest vessel, Sirena, which joins the fleet in April of 2016. Also joining our fleet in 2016 is Regent Seven Seas Explorer. During the quarter we revealed additional concepts that we believe will be very popular onboard the most luxurious cruise ship ever built, including an unrivaled infinity pool and sports deck complex, the addition of a Canyon Ranch SpaClub that rivals any on land, and the addition of a signature Pan-Asian gourmet dining experience called Pacific RIB. The expansion of our fleet with Explorer has allowed us to become more creative and adventurous with our itinerary planning for the Regent brand. As a result, we've announced the return to world cruising with a 128-day voyage aboard Seven Seas Navigator beginning in January of 2017, visiting six continents, 31 countries and calling on over 60 ports. This cruise has proven so popular that 70% of the voyage was booked on the very first day of sales. This is a testament not only to the allure of the Regent brand, but also to our belief that guests, on whichever one of our three brands they choose to sail, want unique, different, and rich destination experiences. Before turning the call over to Wendy, I like to give you an update on our international expansion efforts. First is the appointment of Harry Sommer to the role of Executive Vice President of International Business Development. In addition to serving as head of our successful integration initiatives, Harry has previously held various senior positions in finance, revenue management, and sales and marketing at Prestige as well as Norwegian. In this role, Harry will be responsible for advancing our global expansion strategy for all three of our brands, and I can tell you he has hit the ground running. As I mentioned earlier, our Australia and New Zealand sales offices which will be located in Sydney will be ramping operations soon. We have appointed a well-known industry veteran with a strong track record to head that office and lead our sales and marketing efforts for all three brands in the region. In mainland Europe, we have added responsibility for Prestige sales and marketing activities to the existing Norwegian headquarters in Wiesbaden, Germany and are well along in consolidating our UK operations in Southampton. Looking to Latin America, we leveraged the Norwegian brand's opening of a sales office in Brazil and consolidated all three brands under one managing director for Latin America. Lastly, turning to Asia, while we are excited for the Norwegian brand's return to the region after a 15-year hiatus, we continue to evaluate the opportunity to offer Asian-centric product geared toward consumers in the region, particularly those in China. We have the benefit of learning from the industry's initial entry into the market and are building our intelligence and crafting a strategy for the best way to enter the market. Our Skunk Works team has substantially completed its assessment of entering the China-sourced market with a dedicated vessel perhaps as early as 2017. Our original expectations, if you recall, were to announce a go \u2013 no-go decision by spring 2016. However, given the significant progress made to-date, we now expect an announcement to come sooner than we had initially anticipated. There was a lot of excitement building for the Norwegian, Oceania and Regent brands, but we're here today to talk about our second quarter results, so I'll turn the call over to Wendy to discuss those in more detail. Wendy? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Frank. I'd like to begin by noting that unless otherwise stated the following commentary compares second quarter 2015 and 2014 on an as-reported basis. In order to provide a better comparison of the combined company's performance, we have also provided guidance for net yield and net cruise cost which compares second quarter 2015 results for NCLH against the second quarter of 2014, which includes the results of Prestige. We refer to this guidance as combined company which we have provided on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. For the second quarter 2015, the company generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 compared to $0.58 in the prior year, and at the top end of our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.75. Strong earnings were driven by solid ticket and onboard performance, particularly for the Norwegian brand, along with favorable timing of marketing investments which are now planned for the second half of the year. Adjusted net yield performance was in line with expectations, increasing 18.2% on an as-reported basis as result of a full quarter of consolidation of the upper premium and luxury Prestige brands. On a combined company basis, adjusted net yield increased 1.5%, coming in at the midpoint of guidance of up 1% to 2% and was up 3.2% on a constant currency basis versus guidance of up 3%. The booking levels over the last few months have been one of the most successful in Norwegian Cruise Line's history primarily for two reasons. First was a result of the weaving in of certain aspects of Prestige's go-to-market strategy, where we began messaging to consumer and travel partners that booking early would result in the best value proposition. Second was our Freestyle's Choice offering, which not only benefited sailings in 2015, but also has helped build a solid base for sailings in 2016 and beyond. This offering was very well received by consumers and travel partners alike as it provides amazing value to consumers and higher earnings potential to many of our distribution channels. Now turning to cost, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased by 21.1% on an as-reported basis, mainly due to the addition of the Prestige brands, while on a combined company basis decreased 4.7%. This decrease in cost can be attributed mainly to the timing of certain expenses, including marketing investments which will be deployed in the second half of the year as we ramp up for a new marketing campaign for the Norwegian brand post the announcement of our newly appointed advertising agency. Regarding net cruise costs, I would like to review the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of Prestige. Pursuant to the achievement of certain 2015 revenue targets, this consideration was payable to the shareholders of Prestige of which the initial 50% was based on a cliff vesting hurdle. Based on the probability of achievements this liability has been reversed in the quarter as a result of softness in the more exotic itineraries primarily Africa and Q4 Eastern Mediterranean sailings for the Oceania and Regent brands. The $34.3 million benefit is recorded in the marketing G&A line item and has been adjusted out of earnings. Turning to fuel expense, our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, decreased 10.3% to $558 from $622 in the prior year. While on the topic of fuel, I would like to update you on the progress of our exhaust gas scrubber project. As a result of the complexities surrounding this rapidly evolving technology, together with our decision to enhance the scrubbers from an open to closed loop system, we've experienced delays to the project. The enhancement from open to closed loop will provide future benefits in that it will allow us to fully utilize our scrubber systems while the ships are docked in the vast majority of ports around the world, which enables us to burn lower grade, less expensive fuel, not only while at sea but also while in port. The delay put us outside the original operational timeline submitted to the EPA in order to receive fuel waivers to burn lower grade fuel during the installation period. This caused the EPA to rescind these waivers and as a result has changed our fuel consumption mix, reducing the amount of high sulfur fuel we will burn and in turn causing the fuel hedges associated with this consumption to be designated for GAAP purposes. At current market prices, the incremental impact from the change in our fuel consumption mix for the remainder of 2015 will be approximately $10 million. For the full year 2016, we expect the impact to be approximately $15 million, tapering off to $10 million for full year 2017 as the scrubbers become operational over the course of the installation period. Interest expense net was $52.4 million compared to $31.9 million in 2014 in connection with higher debt balances resulting from the acquisition of Prestige. Other income and expense included a non-recurring charge of $10 million related to the aforementioned de-designation of a portion of our fuel hedge portfolio. This was substantially offset by a $9.4 million benefit from a fair value increase and a foreign currency caller related to the Seven Seas Explorer construction contract. As a reminder, the structure of this caller is not eligible for hedge accounting and will be mark-to-market on a quarterly basis, resulting in future changes to this line item until we take delivery of the vessel in Q2 2016. Now looking to the remainder of the third quarter and full year 2015 in our earnings release. In addition to providing guidance on an as-reported basis for net yield and net cruise cost, we're also providing guidance on these metrics against 2014 Combined Company results as the basis with which to compare 2015 expectations. As stated earlier, these Combined Company results assume the consolidated results of Norwegian and Prestige for the third quarter and full year 2014 as of the beginning of that year. As expected, the remainder of 2015 is shaping up nicely. Norwegian Breakaway, Getaway, and Escape are all commanding double-digit pricing premiums when compared to our core fleet in similar markets. Norwegian Escape, with her first revenue sailing to take place in November, is in a better booked position when compared to Breakaway and Getaway at the same time prior to their delivery. Turning to booking trends for the remainder of the year. The Caribbean is shaping up well with both price and load higher over last year. As for Europe, this market continues to perform well and is booked slightly ahead of last year with pricing flat year-over-year despite softness in the Eastern Med. Alaska is booking well and is better loaded versus last year at comparable pricing. Bermuda is strong this year, well ahead on both pricing and load. And exotic itineraries, such as Africa, are experiencing softness in the back half of the year which is expected to continue into Q1 2016. Looking at guidance, we are maintaining our full year adjusted net yield guidance of up approximately 17.5% on an as-reported basis for results compared to those reported by the company for full year 2014 were up approximately 19% on a constant currency basis. On a Combined Company basis, we expect adjusted net yields to be up approximately 1.5% and 3% on an as-reported and constant currency basis respectively. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel decreases slightly to up approximately 23.25% on an as-reported basis, while on a constant currency basis we expect an increase of approximately 23.75%. On a combined company basis, we expect an increase of approximately 2.5% [and 3% on an as reported and constant currency basis, respectively.] Inclusive of the impacts from the aforementioned increase in fuel expense, we are raising the midpoint of our full year earnings guidance [to now be in the range of $2.80 to $2.90, primarily] due to favorability and operating and interest expense. Guidance for the third quarter in terms of adjusted net yield is as follows. On an as-reported and constant currency basis, we expect adjusted net yield for the third quarter of 2015 to grow in the range of 18% to 19% and 20.5% to 21.5% respectively. On a Combined Company basis, we expect adjusted net yield to increase between 0.5% and 1.5% on an as-reported basis and 2.75% to 3.75% on a constant currency basis. As a result of a shift in timing of certain expenses from the second quarter to the back half of the year, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day on an as-reported basis is expected to increase between 28.5% and 29.75% to 30.75% on a constant currency basis. On a Combined Company basis, we expect an increase of between 5% and 6% on an as-reported basis and 6% to 7% on a constant currency basis. A few items to note regarding net cruise cost. First, Norwegian Epic will undergo her first scheduled dry dock, which is 23 days in length spanning Q3 and Q4. Norwegian Gem also has its scheduled dry dock in Q4, which will be 14 days in length. [Second, as we ramp up for delivery of Norwegian Escape, we will also see] inaugural and launch expenses that will straddle the third and fourth quarters. And lastly, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter are expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.35. Turning to deployment, the third quarter is comprised of our peak seasonal itineraries across our fleets. In order to demonstrate the benefits of diversification from the addition of the Oceania Cruises and Regent fleets, the following compares 2015 deployment on a combined basis to 2014 on a Norwegian brand-only basis. 19% of third quarter capacity is in the Caribbean compared to 23% in 2014. Europe deployment increases 37% from 31%, while Alaska stays constant year-over-year at 18%. And Asia, Africa, Pacific, South America, and world cruises which were areas where the company had no presence in 2014 now combined to account for 2% of capacity with the addition of Prestige's fleet. Looking to 2016, as we previously mentioned, our various strategies are taking a strong hold and as a result, our 2016 booked revenue is approximately 30% higher versus same time last year, while capacity increased approximately 11%. With that, I'll turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Wendy. As Wendy mentioned, 2016 is [shaping up to be another breakout year.] It's hard to believe that by the time of our next call we will have already welcomed Norwegian Escape into our fleet. Not only is she the largest and most ambitious ship in Norwegian's storied history, she's also one of the most popular as evidenced by a strong book position that has outpaced those of her recent predecessors. Her offerings from the first Margaritaville at Sea to our largest Haven complex will make her a fitting addition to Norwegian's innovative fleet. Norwegian's Escape addition also means that this current quarter will be the company's last organic quarter for some time as we layer in the expansion of the Norwegian, Oceania and Regent fleet throughout 2019. As our company grows with these latest additions, we'll continue to execute on our strategies which include the initiatives I spoke of today regarding creating scarcity of itinerary offerings to drive yield and taking full advantage of the Norwegian and Prestige combination to expand our international footprint. We believe these strategies combined with others focusing on driving yields and leveraging our scale will drive Norwegian's growth well into the future and keep us on track for our 2017 earnings target of $5 per share and the doubling of our ROIC from our IPO levels in 2013 to 14% by the end of 2018. Thank you all for your continued support. We'd like to go ahead and open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Felecia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, and thank you. Frank, just to kind of hop on to your closing comments and Wendy's closing comments, at the beginning of your remarks you called 2016 a breakout year. You guys put in the release and in the prepared remarks about your strong bookings for next year. You're going to have a new ship. You're changing out your milk runs. You're growing internationally. So I'm just assuming that by calling 2016 a breakout year, you mean that all of these items will manifest themselves. So I wanted to just make sure I was understanding that properly and maybe you could talk about some things that you see going forward additionally. And I think previously you had talked about perhaps beating that $5 goal? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Felecia. Yeah, by breakout year, I meant it in a very positive way. The 30% better book revenue is very healthy. It comes from both load factor improvement and pricing improvement. And we continue to see very strong onboard spend especially on our newer vessels. And as we stated in the release, we continue to see that double-digit premium of the newer vessels versus the legacy vessels. So, the Escape is booking well. The Explorer is booking phenomenally well, as is Sirena on the Oceania side. We've upped our synergies for 2015. That doesn't mean that we're giving up on finding additional opportunities. They're there. But as I'd mentioned earlier, we want to close the book on synergies, the define number and focus more on an ongoing business. So it just looks very, very strong, Felecia. The industry is strong. You've seen our colleagues also report strength and so there's a lot to be optimistic about. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you touch on that $5 goal? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's still the goal. And not only is it the goal, but I think we feel more confident than ever that we're going to get there. So, still a year away or more than a year away. We're focused on 2016 and 2016 looks very, very strong, which hopefully will lead to even a stronger 2017. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura. Your line is open. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Can you talk more specifically about your outlook for the Caribbean next year? What kind of supply growth do you expect overall for the area, and what kind of pricing you would hope to get on your same-store fleet? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So first off, Harry, on our deployment, our Caribbean capacity for the full year 2015 is at 41% and next year it will grow to 43%. And Frank, do you want to address the pricing? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's a bit early, Harry to give you a whole lot of color on pricing, but as I said a little earlier to Felecia's question, we're seeing 2016 strength both in load factor and in pricing. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Specifically what I was after is on the supply growth, I appreciate your capacity, your mix going up, but there are some concerns that after a year in 2015 where we actually have a tailwind on supply overall in the Caribbean that it's actually going to go up 4% or 5% next year. Is that a number that's consistent with what you're expecting? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, we're anticipating 2%... Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...for the supply growth. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Industry-wide. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And then, just quickly touching on China, can you give us a sense of a little more color on what your plans are in China? There seems to be an evolution of how you fill ships in China. As you look into putting capacity there, are you likely to fill ships or a ship with partners? Are you planning on building out a marketing and sales force? Just a little more color on your plans there would be great? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : That would be premature. We have not announced that we're going to China yet and so I'd rather stay away from answering specific questions. Time will come for us to make that call. But I agree that China is a different model than the rest of the world, although it is beginning to move more towards FIT bookings and the charter model. But it's been successful. I think you've heard the other lines several times now mention how their most profitable ships, their high yielding ships are based in China and everything that we have seen indicated that is correct and so we want in on that action. And like I said earlier, things are going well with our review and our assessment of the potential of China and Asia in general. And so, we will make the decision to go or not go earlier than we once thought. And I like to leave it at that for now. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So last question is, it sounds like there is room for the possibility of your capacity going in before 2017, it's a possibility. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Not before 2017. If we decide to go to China, our ships will not arrive there in 2016 and 2017 at the earliest if we decide to go. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open. Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. So, Frank, you talked about in the release earmarking certain synergy savings for reinvestment and you just barely glanced over it in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe help us think about what you're targeting in terms of some of those reinvestments? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, on prior calls we've said that we're going to invest in the onboard product, primarily in improving menus and we believe the way to a person's heart is through their stomach and so we want to make our food offerings the best they can be. We're also going to be investing monies in additional marketing to coincide with the new ad agency that we've contracted with. We want to keep the momentum going throughout 2016. Remember there's a new vessel coming on the Norwegian brand for 2017. And so, we believe that a combination of sales and marketing initiatives, primarily for the Norwegian brand, but some for the Prestige brand as well combined with an improvement in the onboard food product for the Norwegian brand is the overwhelming majority of that reinvestment. Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, got you. Then second question with regards to your book to load position for the remainder of the year. We've heard your competitors out there saying they're in the best position they've ever been. Is that a similar type of story that you guys are in at this point as well? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. We've said for some time now that we're in a better book position for the next six quarters over the last two quarters of the year and all of next year than we were at this time last year. Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Two sort of housekeeping items and then just a question about your forward guidance, for Q2, just looking at a couple of the add-backs, can you just give more color around there was, I guess $11 million of expenses related to the Prestige acquisition last year that fell in this quarter and it looks like this is separate from accounting changes and separate from severance. So I was just wondering what that is. Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I'll handle that. So about two-thirds of the $10.9 million is related to termination and break fees, for example, a large item in there is the breaking the casino contract that Prestige had, so that we could bring it in-house and handle the casino similarly to how we've handled Norwegian and successfully grown it through the years. And the other third is related to integration costs and SOX compliance to really get Prestige SOX-compliant. But also as we integrate all of our programs together, we've got a big push here that we've got to have that done by the end of the year. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then, on the fuel expense \u2013 and you guys talked about why that may be going up \u2013 I just want to clarify. Is the $10 million higher fuel cost that's from the EPA rescinding waivers, is that the same $10 million that you call out in the add backs that loss of $10 million related to fuel swap hedge contracts or are those two different expenses? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. They're actually two different expenses. It happens to be the same number. So I don't know if you want me to clarify anything more on that, but there actually is some offsets in there too. So we've got a loss of $10 million related to the certain hedge contracts, and then we also have had $9.4 million that's related to the Explorer exchange that's offsetting that. So that's in there. And then we also have the $10 million for the MGO fuel cost because we're going to have to now burn the more expensive fuel towards the back half of the year. So it just happens to be similar amounts. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But that $10 million in higher fuel cost \u2013 that's just going to run through your regular operating expense? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. And then the other thing to note is that, there is additional amounts that we'll actually see in 2016 and 2017, but that will mitigate. So it will be an additional $15 million in fuel expense into 2016 and $10 million into 2017. Three of the ships that are getting scrubbers put on them will actually be online by the second half of next year \u2013 actually in the first half before we get to June. And so, then it starts to taper down and then the remaining scrubbers will go out into 2017. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just my last question. Frank, you mentioned the $5 a share in EPS, still the goal for 2017. Is it still fair to say that \u2013 you have talked about potential upside to that coming from additional Prestige synergies like you announced today and if there is share repurchase at some point between now and then, those things would be kind of incremental to the $5. Is that still how we should think of it? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And don't forget that of all the synergies we've talked about, we've never ascribed a single penny to improved pricing from a new go-to-market strategy that as we said earlier we see a 30% increase in revenue \u2013 book revenue year-over-year. So that also can be very much accretive to that basic $5. And my guess is that that would be the highest potential area to the $5 would be how much more pricing \u2013 ticket pricing we can see on the Norwegian brand because of the new strategy. Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And the other thing that I would add in is that \u2013 that also assumes $790 million in debt pay downs, so we've got that money out there as we message numerous times to either pay down debt or buy back shares. So, we've got some options there. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Just a couple here. Relating to the fuel, Wendy, and the expiration of the hedges or the falling out of those, is the net of that plus any incremental hedges that you've layered on to, is that what we're seeing in your hedge percentage guidance here that you outlined in the press release? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. So the hedge percentage actually goes down because now it's the remainder that is left in, that's getting hedge accounting, that percentage is related to the HFO that we will actually burn for the remainder of the year and so that's the cause of it going down. You will not see that change, so it's now at 48% for 2015, 54% for 2016. And you probably have noticed that we've layered in some additional hedges in the back two years, now moving up to 44% in 2017. But the change down is purely related to the de-designation of our accounting hedges. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Theoretically, could you continue to put more hedges on \u2013 although they may not qualify as of yet until you get some of the other scrubbers online and then we can see that percentage jump? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, definitely for the outer years we could do that if we chose to. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, some others in the industry provided some, I guess, waiting by quarter or directional wait, I should say by quarter and by the year on your FX. Is there anything that you guys could provide there either here on the call or in the filing or follow-up? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, so the first thing I would say is just as a reminder, roughly 15% of our currency is coming in from foreign source. It has shifted a little bit. So we used to say that of that 15%, 10% was euros; that's gone down to about 8% now and the pound has actually moved up a little from 5 % to 6% with the remainder being Australian currency. And then, Tim, were you looking for sensitivities? Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess, just the more the waiting by quarters, where you had the exposure or ranking maybe by quarters and then you just kind of gave it for the year. But by quarters any \u2013 just sort of how we should think about the cadence of the ranking by quarters. Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so third quarter definitely would be the highest and then fourth quarter obviously we're moving a lot into the Caribbean. And then as far as cadence, I can tell you on a full year basis, $0.01 change on the yield impact for the euro would be 4.3 bps. The pound is about 2.0 bps, Canadian 3.5 bps, and Australian at 2.1 bps. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then Frank, one of the things that you outlined in the Analyst Day was an objective and a goal to really push to source more Canadians, similar to what Prestige had been doing, but source more for the Norwegian brand. Just maybe an update on that. Does that seem like a pretty good size pocket of opportunity relative to what others were doing in the industry? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, relative to what the Prestige brands had done in Canada, the Norwegian brands had underperformed. And so we have geared up in Canada and are beginning to see positive results. Our international source business, and you can include Canada in that broad international space, is improving. So we like what we see in the international expansion. And we're glad that we've made those investments. It's beginning to pay off. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then, lastly you talked about your 30% booked revenue increase for 2016 on a year-over-year basis. Can you say just in absolute terms how much of your capacity you have booked for 2015 and then any color if you would on 2016 on an absolute basis? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : You want to know what our occupancy is for 2015. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, just as a percent of capacity for 2015, how much were you booked at this point for the full year, granted part of the year is already done? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : That's something that we normally don't give out, especially not by brand. But we like very much where we are. We're substantially complete. Especially the Oceania and Regent brands which are booked much further out than the Norwegian brand does. So that's about all I can tell you about that. And for 2016, we're really excited because it's throughout the year and to have a 30% bump year-over-year within only 11% increase in capacity just gives you a feel for how robust the business is coming in and it's been that way for several months. This is a slow steady build up. And we're seeing slow steady buildup both in load and in price. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. No, definitely great metrics. Thank you, sir. Operator : Our next question comes from Joel Simkins from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Christie Fredericks - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is actually Christie on for Joel. And I just wanted to ask how you're thinking about opportunities in Cuba, should this open up to U.S customers, and how quickly you'd move to dedicate capacity there? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, so I'm very much involved in our Cuba strategy. We believe that once Cuba opens up totally, it's going to be a real windfall for the industry. Everyone is excited about China and I believe that Cuba can have a similar positive impact on the industry as a whole given its proximity to the United States and given that the Caribbean as a whole represents some 40% of the industry's deployment. We have applied for our OFAC license from the Department of U.S. Treasury. We've applied for our Commerce Department export license and are waiting to hear the positive results. And we've also engaged the Cuban government in the discussions necessary to obtain their permission as well. I don't know the timeline for any of those three licenses to come through, but I am hopeful that they will happen before the year is out. In terms of how quickly we can deploy a vessel, suddenly vessels \u2013 the availability of vessels comes into play, given how far in advance we're booked. As I stated earlier up 30% of book revenue for the following year. So I don't have an answer for you. It's going to be a nice problem to have to find a vessel that you move from an existing deployment to Cuba. By definition, given the infrastructure limitations, it looks like the first vessel that would go to Cuba would most likely come from the Oceania fleet as opposed to the large vessels or the larger vessels of the Norwegian fleet. So it's still very much a project that's in progress. This is very new to a lot of people both in the U.S. and in Cuba. And \u2013 but we're hopeful that, as I said earlier, the applicable permissions from both governments come soon. And then, we'll have an interesting dilemma on our hands of what vessel to deploy to Cuba and from where. Christie Fredericks - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Lara A. Fourman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. This is Lara stepping in for Steve. I was just wondering what \u2013 in terms of the discount to sell and market-to-sell strategy and kind of transitioning from one to the other, is that contributing to any of your 2016 bookings being up 30%? And then, also my second question was just if you could give us some color on how the Breakaway bookings look in the fourth quarter and early next year as well as Anthem enters the New York City market. Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : You can never attribute any broad market move to any one particular action, but I do believe that on the broadest scale that the new go-to-market strategy focusing on value, not necessarily low price, taking prices up steadily over time, the strong messaging in the consumers \u2013 to consumers and travel agents alike, that this is a great deal, that travel agents are earning higher commissions on, because of higher pricing. It all works together and helps elongate the booking curve. So one of the things that we're seeing is part of that 30% increase in revenue is an elongation of the booking curve into 2016 quite significantly. So we're very happy about that. And in terms of Breakaway, Breakaway is doing great. She's behaving much like she behaved in prior years. Her pricing is up. The onboard spend, at least, through the month of July this year is double digits percentage wise, better than the core fleet. So Breakaway loves New York and New Yorkers love Breakaway. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open. Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research : Hi, good morning. I'm curious now that your study on Asia or the Far East seems to be wrapping up. Is there any early read-throughs that you guys are willing to share with us from that? And then, now that you guys are opening an office in Sydney, how are you thinking about the sourcing strategy outside of the earlier discussion on Canada longer term maybe from some of these other markets? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : In terms of sourcing, I don't think it was any change. Remember that Norwegian has after delivery of Escape three more vessels coming, one in 2017, one in 2018, and one in 2019. So we need to expand all our channels. Don't want to take anything for granted. We want more demand, that's going to push up yields. And so, we think that Australia is an underserved market for the Norwegian brand and are excited to be able to open up our own office there to service all three brands and that we're able to recruit a very talented experienced executive to head up that office. In terms of Asia, the read-through is that other cruise lines have been successful in Asia. It's no longer a startup market, if you will. I think some of our competitors are now celebrating close to 10 years of being in China. And given that the Norwegian fleet has now grown or will have grown by 2019 to 17 vessels, it's time for us to take a look and deploy some of our tonnage there which we hope to be able to make that decision like I said in short order. Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Hardiman from Wedbush. Your line is open. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the trend you're seeing with respect to onboard yields as compared to ticket yields. I guess a couple of different things here. One, should we be backing out the entirety of the deferred revenues from the ticket or is some of that onboard? Secondly, are you still seeing European customers balk a little bit with respect to onboard spending just given the currency situation? And third as more of your brands move towards bundling traditionally onboard products and services into the ticket price, how should we think about where that shows up in your income whether it's booked or onboard? Thanks. Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, great. So first off, no, you don't want to be backing out the deferred revenue. We actually show that in the adjustments to add it back in to show what the real revenue power is of the company as opposed to how you have to account for it in the acquisition. Regarding our onboard revenue, in general, we've been seeing very robust onboard revenue in the company. If you segregate out the European-sourced customers, it's down but it's marginal and overall we're seeing strong onboard revenue throughout our fleets. And then, regarding how we account for it, we're allocating that on a retail value. So if you're selling the bucket, it's being allocated equally based on the retail values to both ticket and onboard on a GAAP basis. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. And just so I understand, the deferred piece -- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to back it out, add it back. Do I add it back 100% to ticket? Or is it split between ticket and onboard? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's to ticket. Good question. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess last question for me and ultimately this should be just math, but you've got a lot of moving pieces here given the acquisition and everything else. How should we think about the implied yield growth and cost growth in the fourth quarter? Again, we should have the pieces here to get to those numbers. But on a combined company basis, are yields accelerating in the fourth quarter versus 3Q and how should we think about costs? Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so clearly taking our full year and you can get to the implied numbers. But they are accelerating in Q4. Q4 in the prior year was a weaker quarter for us. But you will see some nice yield growth in our Q4 this year. You guys can all back into the numbers. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And what's... Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : ...duration in Q1. As the go-to-market strategy takes a hold and greater percentage of the bookings come as a result of that new strategy as opposed to legacy strategy for old bookings, the pricing improves and accelerates into the future. So Q1 is better than Q4 and Q2 is better than Q1, et cetera. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And the other thing I would say is I would stay focused on the constant dollars, I mean, there has definitely been a shift with currency fluctuating the way it has this year that we're really \u2013 to really look at our true results. We're saying look more at the constant dollar. The other thing is on the net cruise cost based on the guidance in Q3, the implied number for net cruise cost is down from where it is at Q3 to get to our full year number. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : We have time for one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from Assia Georgieva from Infiniti Research. Your line is open. Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research Ltd.: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Frank, if I may, I'd like to go back to your characterization of 2006 being a breakout year. We have investment in international sales infrastructure obviously and the itinerary diversification. This latter factor, in the past and the Norwegian Sun comes to mind, had become a little bit of an issue when that ship went to Alaska, because travel agents were slow to embrace a new vessel that they weren't as familiar within that market. Do you think we may see a little bit of hesitation with Norwegian Star? And as part of that, is the expectation for 2016 more on yield or on EPS as well? Thank you so much. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Look, remember we took our lowest yielding seven-day product, which was our winter ship out of Houston and that's the one that's going to Asia for the Western market. So our risk reward factor is high. That's where marketing comes in. I think we're much more of a marketing focused company today than we might have been before and therefore we will make sure that our past guests who we are going to rely on quite a bit to fill these vessels in Asia, because of the pent-up demand. They've been on our Norwegian fleet across the world. They haven't been to Asia with us. The high producing travel agents not just in the U.S., but around the world who have been asking us to go to Asia. So no \u2013 and remember, one more thing, Asia, it is a seasonal deployment. So, there's a lot of pent-up demand that wants to go to Asia over a 4.5 to 5 month period of our lowest yielding product that it replaces. So, I think it all points up very positively. And I'm sorry, but I didn't get your second question. Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research Ltd.: On 2006 (sic) [2016] (1:02:09), should we be looking towards yield or yield and EPS being breakout metrics? Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think both. Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research Ltd.: Okay. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. If yields are up, your EPS better be up. Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research Ltd.: Well, given an infrastructure investments, that was a little bit of a concern of mine. Thank you so much for taking my question, both of you. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Wendy A. Beck - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for your time and support. As always, we'll be available to answer your questions later today. All the best. Bye, bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions for that session will follow at that time. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Nicholas. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow with commentary on the results for the quarter, as well as provided updated guidance for 2015, before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. We will then open up the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com, and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results I would like to cover just a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2015 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. I would also like to review information about forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP information as a part of this call. The company's commentary today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations. The company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see the company's SEC filings. In addition, some of the comments may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the company's earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea. And welcome, everyone. Appreciate everyone joining us today. As you saw from our press release this morning, Norwegian posted impressive record results for the third quarter, particularly the top line where our industry-leading net yields continued its quarter-over-quarter acceleration, exceeded our guidance range and drove strong earnings growth of 22%, with adjusted earnings per share coming in at the top end of our guidance. These results demonstrate how our various strategic initiatives that we began implementing earlier this year are driving outsized earnings growth. From our go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill versus discounting to fill, to our consistent consumer communication of emphasizing value over price, these strategies resulted in strong yield performance that is more commensurate with a quarter that has the benefit of a new build introduction as opposed to the actual case this quarter where yield and revenue growth were purely organic and came solely from same-store operations. This quarter marks our third consecutive quarter of net yield growth with yield essentially flat in the first quarter coming off very strong prior year performance, yields up 3% in the second quarter and now up 4.7% in the third quarter. This strong booking momentum continues into 2016 where we are entering the year at record loads, well ahead of last year, and significantly exceeding our 11% increase in capacity with higher pricing across all brands, and an extended bookings curve that is now 12% longer than same time last year, allowing us to optimize pricing for 2016 and beyond. Wendy will delve more deeply into current financial results along with color on 2016 later in the call. But for now, while traditionally my commentary has focused on discussing key events and strategic initiatives, I'd be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to discuss our recent events and announcements that occurred outside of the third quarter, but which are essential to Norwegian's growth trajectory, both in the short and long term. Most recently is the addition of Norwegian Escape. At approximately 4,200 berth, she is the company's largest ship and the latest incarnation of its freestyle offering. We've been taking immensely popular award-winning design of our Breakaway Class Ships and added new features, venues and entertainment options that build on the already high level of freedom and flexibility found on all Norwegian Cruise Line ships. Norwegian Escape has enjoyed record setting bookings, which have surpassed our highest expectations, and outpaced the strong booking levels that we experienced with each of Norwegian's most recent three new builds. She also continues to garner double-digit yield premiums when compared to other ships in the same or similar itineraries, and deservedly so. As you know, my cruise background is from the upscale side of the business, and pound-for-pound, or should I say ton-for-ton, the design and offerings on Norwegian Escape will impress the most discerning upscale travelers. The design of her public venues in the cuisine served in all of her restaurants are on par with fine restaurants found in any large international city, and her suites leave nothing to be desired. She truly sets a new standard for mega ships in the industry. A few weeks prior to the delivery of Norwegian Escape, we made a series of other announcements that reinforce our long-term commitment to the international expansion efforts of our three brands. First was the official opening of our sales and marketing office in Australia, which is our first in the Pacific region. This Sydney based team represents all three of our brands, and offers the support to travel partners and guests in Australia and New Zealand, a market where we have grown our guests by 12% over the last three years. The office, which opened ahead of Norwegian Cruise Lines returned to sailing in the Asia-Pacific region in late 2016, with a product geared to Western guests will also support the Oceania and Regent brands, which have sailed in the region for some time. This new Australia office, combined with our offices in the UK, continental Europe and Brazil, lend dedicated sales and marketing support to our three brands in key source markets worldwide. Our second and most important announcement was regarding a 2017 entry into the world's fastest growing market, China. During an intensive nine-month study, a dedicated team of senior executives worked with experts in the Chinese cruise industry and analyzed the market potential and its competitive landscape. At the completion of our research the results were clear. The size, scope and growth potential of the Chinese cruise market was so compelling that Norwegian's entry wasn't a matter of if, but when, and also how. In 2014 Chinese vacationers accounted for over 100 million outbound international trips to destinations as close as Hong Kong and as far as the United States. Of these, only about 700,000, not even 1% were on cruises. These 100 million travelers led the world in tourism spend, close to $165 billion, accounting for 13% of global tourism receipts. To put this into perspective, the second closest country was the United States whose approximately 60 million outbound travelers spent about $110 billion, almost a third less than the spend of Chinese travelers. Equally as important as the compelling and almost numbing potential is to ensure that we have a thorough understanding of Chinese vacationers' wants and needs when it comes to their vacation experiences. First to service Chinese travelers who prefer to stay close to their home, we announced the deployment of a highly customized and purpose-built ship for the Chinese market to debut in the summer of 2017. This ship will sail under the Norwegian Cruise Line brand, and is the second in our existing four-ship order of Breakaway Plus Class vessels. As for the ship's design, not only will we take the best of the features from across the fleet to bring to life the Norwegian brand's unique offerings of freedom and flexibility, which our research determine resonates very well with the Chinese consumer, we will also draw upon the depth of design experience from all three of our brands, as well as from a host of Chinese lifestyle experts that we have retained specifically for this purpose to create a purpose-built ship that is from the onset equipped to cater to the unique needs, desire and tastes of the Chinese vacationer. We will be announcing more regarding the ship's unique designs and first-at-sea features in regular updates and reveal as the ship's launch draws closer. As with all ships, the guest experience isn't just predicated on the quality of the hardware, it's the quality of the crew that brings the ship to life that really counts. Our dedication to the China market goes beyond just delivering outstanding hardware. We must also deliver an outstanding cruise experience. And to this end, our hotel operations team is partnering with Chinese hospitality experts to recruit Mandarin-speaking personnel and craft training programs that will result in an onboard staff that is able to deliver the highly personalized service that we are known for, while still being cognizant of the cultural differences that are unique to China. We strongly believe that the combination of stellar service tuned to local sensibilities, a product offering that includes a variety of authentic Mandarin, Cantonese and Szechuan dining venues, and entertainment options geared towards local tastes, all in a ship designed to have expanded onboard shopping, gaming and family-friendly areas with never before seen features at sea, will amaze our guests and will give Norwegian the best cruise proposition in the region. With the hardware and staffing component of our strategy complete, we turn our attention to sourcing, which will be managed by our recently opened sales and marketing offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. These offices will serve a dual role. First, they will support our travel agent partners to capture a portion of the 80 million Chinese vacationers who opt for short haul vacations and steer them to a cruise vacation. Opening these offices a full 18 months prior to the delivery of our China dedicated ship will allow ample time to further develop relationships with key travel partners, obtain their guidance on devising strategies to drive demand to cruising, and build brand awareness among Chinese cruisers. The second role of these offices is to grow China as a source market for long haul cruises outside of the region on our three brands. China is already our fastest growing source market, with guests growing at a three-year CAGR of 30%. With vessels of all sizes and offerings for every taste, our company is in a unique position to offer Chinese cruisers a vacation experience that is tailored to their desires. While investment for the expansion of these offices, as well as marketing efforts to build brand awareness have already begun, the majority of the ramp up will occur in 2016 with the first sailing expected to occur in the summer of 2017. We are excited about the opportunity to enter the China source short haul market with the largest, newest and most innovative ship in the region, and look forward to having Chinese travelers experience the freedom and flexibility that makes the Norwegian Cruise Line an incredible vacation experience. And now to discuss our strong results for the quarter and our outlook, I'll turn the call over to Wendy. Wendy A. Beck: Thanks, Frank. I'd like to begin by noting that unless otherwise stated, the following commentary compares third quarter 2015 and 2014 on an as reported basis. In order to provide a better comparison of our company's current performance versus last year prior to the combination of Norwegian and Prestige, we provided guidance for adjusted net yield and adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per capacity day, which compares third quarter 2015 results for NCLH against third quarter of 2014, which includes the results of Prestige. We refer to this guidance as combined company, which we have provided on both an as reported and constant currency basis. For the third quarter of 2015, the company generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 compared to $1.11 in the prior year, and at the top end of our guidance range of $1.30 to $1.35. Strong earnings were driven by solid net yield performance, mainly due to strength in the Caribbean, Bermuda and Alaska markets which more than offset softness in certain European itineraries. Adjusted net yield outperformed expectations, increasing 19.8% on an as reported basis as a result of a full quarter of the consolidation of Prestige, as well as strong pricing. On a combined company basis, adjusted net yield increased 2.2% coming in above guidance of up 0.5% to 1.5% and was up 4.7% on a constant currency basis versus guidance of 2.75% to 3.75%. Our go-to-market strategy and other initiatives have led to a strong base of bookings which has lengthened the booking curve versus prior year, allowing us the opportunity to optimize pricing. Turning to cost, adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, increased 30.5% on an as reported basis, mainly due to the addition of Prestige, while on a combined company basis increased 6.4%. This increase in cost can be attributed mainly to the timing of marketing expenses and incremental discretionary shipboard enhancements and maintenance costs which will drive future returns. As a reminder, net cruise costs are always best viewed on an annual basis as the timing of expenses may cause variations between the quarters. Turning to fuel expense, our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges decreased 11.7% to $566 from $641 in the prior year. Fuel price per metric ton, excluding the impact of our hedges, was $4.91 compared to $6.34 (sic) [$491 compared to $634] in 2014. Now taking a look below the line, interest expense net was $49.8 million compared to $32.3 million in 2014, mainly due to higher debt balances resulting from the acquisition of Prestige. Turning to the remainder of the year, we have provided guidance on an as reported and combined company basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 in our earnings release. While the combination of Norwegian and Prestige occurred midway through the fourth quarter of 2014, this combined company guidance assumes the consolidated results of Norwegian and Prestige for the full fourth quarter as well as the full year 2014. As a result of continued solid net yield performance, we are increasing our full year adjusted net yield guidance to approximately 17.75% on an as reported basis, or 19.5% on a constant currency basis. On a combined company basis we expect adjusted net yield to be up approximately 1.75%, and from 3.25% to 3.5% on an as reported and constant currency basis, respectively. Turning to costs, full year adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, increases slightly from prior guidance to approximately 23.5% on an as reported basis, while on a constant currency basis we expect an increase of approximately 24.75%. On a combined company basis we expect an increase of approximately 2.75% and 3.5% on an as reported and constant currency basis, respectively. The increase is primarily due to dry-docks for Norwegian Epic and Gem in the fourth quarter where we took the opportunity to make several guest facing enhancements, which were not in the original plan, but which contribute to our ability to generate outsized pricing performance. Looking at fuel expense for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $535 and $545, respectively. Excluding the impact of hedges, fuel price per metric ton is expected to be $380 and $435, respectively. As of September 30, 2015, we had hedges in place for 59% of our expected fuel consumption the remainder of the year at an average price of $475. Our expected consumption is approximately 185,000 metric tons and 670,000 metric tons for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. On an annual basis our fuel mix which varies by season is in the high 60%s and the remainder is marine gas oil. As a result of the aforementioned increase in our guidance for adjusted net yield and adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.90 for the year. The pricing strength in Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries along with all of the new strategies implemented this year more than offset the incremental fuel expense as a result of the change in our fuel mix, as well as the softness in exotic itinerary such as Africa and Eastern Mediterranean. Guidance for the fourth quarter in terms of adjusted net yield is as follows. On an as reported and constant currency basis we expect adjusted net yield for the fourth quarter 2015 to grow approximately 13.75% and 14.75% respectively. On a combined company basis we expect adjusted net yield to increase approximately 4.5% on an as reported basis, and 5.5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, per capacity day on an as reported basis is expected to increase approximately 13% (sic) [15%] and 17% on a constant currency basis. On a combined company basis we expect an increase of approximately 4% on an as reported basis, and 5% on a constant currency basis. To provide some relativity on a combined company basis, a 25 basis point change to adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day in the quarter equates to approximately $1 million. And lastly, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.50. Turning to deployment, the fourth quarter contains several repositioning voyages as ships redeploy from summer to winter itineraries. The following compares 2015 deployments to 2014 which included only a partial quarter of Prestige. 47% of fourth quarter capacity is in the Caribbean compared to 60% in 2014. Europe accounts for 15% of deployment which is similar to last year. And the balance is comprised of Bermuda, Hawaii and other itineraries along with repositioning sailings. Looking to 2016, as we mentioned on our last call, 2016 is following the footsteps of 2015 and is shaping up to be a breakout year. While it's too early to provide detailed guidance, I'd like to give some color on quarterly cadence. There are two main items to consider from a year-over-year perspective. First, we are looking forward to welcoming Sirena and Seven Seas Explorer into our fleet as part of our measured fleet expansion program. The revenue benefit from these fleet additions, as well as a full year of Norwegian Escape, will be truly evident in our 2016 results. Second, 2016 will include eight scheduled dry-docks of various lengths totaling 131 days compared to five in 2015 totaling 63 days. Let's discuss how these ship additions and dry-docks affect each quarter. We anticipate the first quarter will be a tougher year-over-year comparison from a yield perspective. There are two scheduled dry-docks in Q1 compared to one in 2015, which includes an extensive 24-day dry-dock for Pride of America, the Norwegian brand's highest yielding ship. In addition, Norwegian Epic will experience lower yields due to her deployment in Europe during the off-peak winter season, compared to what she garnered in the Caribbean in the prior year. In the second quarter, Sirena will join the Oceania Cruises fleet, and will immediately undergo an extensive 35-day dry-dock to bring her up to the standards of her sister vessels, with her first sailing commencing in late April. Seven Seas Explorer will join the Regent fleet in June, with inaugural and launch expenses spanning the second and third quarters. There are four scheduled dry-docks in 2016 for 62 days versus one in the prior year for 10 days. In Q3 Seven Seas Explorer begin to revenue sailings in mid-July. This is the first new build for the Regent fleet in over 13 years, so there is much anticipation for her arrival. As for dry-docks, there are none scheduled in 2016, compared to the beginning of Norwegian Epic's dry-dock late in the third quarter of 2015. The quarter also includes a 40-day bareboat charter of Norwegian Getaway. Lastly, in the fourth quarter there are two scheduled dry-docks totaling 40 days compared to two in 2015 totaling 32 days, which includes the majority of the 23-day dry-dock for Norwegian Epic, which span the third and fourth quarters of this year. Overall for 2016 we see continuing strength in the Caribbean where Norwegian Escape and Getaway are deployed year round to Miami. In addition, Europe is shaping up well for 2016, while exotic itineraries such as Africa are experiencing some softness. Overall we continue to see the momentum build, and have generated solid demand as we move into 2016, which will enable us to maximize pricing. With that, I'll turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy. Now in a few weeks we will mark the first anniversary of the combination of Norwegian and Prestige. And I have to tell you that I'm extremely pleased with the seamless and smooth integration of the two companies. When you walk the halls of Norwegian, you would find it hard to believe that a year ago we were operating as separate entities. Today our operations are completely interwoven with vessel operations, revenue management, supply chain, logistic and support services all under one corporate umbrella. And while the synergy harvesting program officially came to an end last quarter, these areas continue to share best practices and uncover further efficiencies. It's part of the DNA that we have fostered in this combined company. 2015 has been an eventful year. And while not yet over, but as I stated earlier, we are in a very strong book position, in fact, the best in the company's history, which sets up a robust 2016. A year ago, or excuse me, a year where the convergence of our revenue enhancement strategies combined with international expansion and planning fleet additions will result in increase to our already industry-leading net yields. We also look forward to reaching notable milestones such as $5 billion in revenue, $12 billion in assets, posting record EBITDA margins, and continuing our series of consecutive quarters of EBITDA growth. All on our march towards our targeted adjusted earnings per share of at least $5 in 2017 and the doubling of our return on invested capital to 14% in 2018. Thank you all for your continued interest and support. We'd like to go ahead and open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wendy, thanks a lot for the color on the cadence of the quarters. That was helpful. And, Frank, you kind of wrapped up by saying that Norwegian's in the best book position in the company's history. But if I could just drill down a little further and maybe just get kind of obvious, are you booked higher on a load and APCDs for 2016? And then, taking the cadence that you discussed, Wendy, in the prepared remarks, are you seeing that for every quarter of 2016? Frank J. Del Rio : The answer to your first question is yes. More booked \u2013 more passengers booked, more revenue booked, significantly outstripping our capacity increases, as I said it earlier. And we see stronger pricing across all three brands. Felicia Hendrix : And, Wendy how does that fall across the quarters? You said first quarter would be a little tougher. Wendy A. Beck: We still are positive, Felicia, but it is definitely skewed with Q1 having several hurdles, as I mentioned, with the Epic deployment in Europe. And as you all know, we've now moved the Epic for the following year. So we're overlapping that, as well as taking our highest Norwegian yielding ship out of the fleet for 24 days in Q1. So Q1 is the most skewed on the pricing. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Thanks. And then, Frank just moving to China, you gave us a lot of color there earlier. I was just wondering how should we think about your MS&A expenses as you build up infrastructure in China. And do you expect the ship to generate a profit on a fully allocated per PPCD (28:03) basis as early as 2017? Frank J. Del Rio : Not sure it'll turn a profit in the full first year given that we only have six months of operation and a full year of expense. A lot will depend on just the kind of yield premiums we'll be able to achieve. But clearly all the potential that we see in China, the alternative itineraries that you would deploy, that or any vessel, China is clearly the winner. The expense so far in 2015 has been minimal. We will ramp up in 2016. We're finalizing the budgets now. But it will impact the result in 2016. But it's an investment. You have to think of entering China almost as a startup where you have upfront expenses and you have to wait at least a year, in our case up to 18 months, before you start generating revenue. But we think that's the way to do it. We don't want to rush into the market. But we think it will pay dividends once we do with this brand new ship, as I described, the biggest ship that we'll be operating in China. So we're very bullish on the opportunities there. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. But despite that you're still confirming or reiterating the at least $5 goal and the 14% ROI goal. Frank J. Del Rio : Absolutely. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Harry C. Curtis: Hi, good morning. Just going back to one of Felicia's questions, can you give us a sense of how well booked, what percentage of bookings you are in 2016 so far? And I'm guessing that the \u2013 as of today, the pricing that you're seeing across your three brands is now ahead of where it was at this point last year. Frank J. Del Rio : Hi, Harry. Yes, we are ahead versus where we were last year. A bit early to give you specific guidance on \u2013 and of course, we never give guidance on a per brand basis. But our target is to be about 55% booked or so for the three companies combined, three brands combined, by the end of the year. Wendy A. Beck: And we're on target for that. Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. Harry C. Curtis: Okay. Just along the same lines, is it \u2013 it is early, but can you venture to say kind of what your worse case yield outlook ought to be next year? Frank J. Del Rio : No. I think that's not the right question to ask. We believe that the yields next year will be better than they were this year, but that's as far as we'll go at this time. Wendy A. Beck: The only other color I would add to that, Harry, is if you know our long-range model, we say 3% to 4% in years that we bring in a new ship, which you know is significant with the yield that we report in this quarter. As we pointed out it's an organic quarter. Historically we've said our yield will be 2% to 3% on comp fleets. Our goal this year has been to drive the yield strength on our organic fleet in addition to getting the bump with bringing in new ships. So in a year where we bring in the new ship, like next year, our long-range model is 3% to 4%. Obviously we're looking to beat that and that's the path that we're on. Harry C. Curtis: Okay. And my last question, just related to some of the costs in the third quarter, it was interesting that year-over-year, both your other ship operating and your SG&A they were definitely higher than we were looking for. And if you could talk about what in the quarter you view as recurring versus non-recurring, that would be helpful. Thanks. Wendy A. Beck: Yeah. So the first thing is in Q2 we said that we were deferring a number of our marketing expenses. As you know, we mentioned that we hired a new marketing agency and we are in the process of launching a new marketing campaign. So part of it is ramp up with marketing. Also as we go into international, we've been layering in some marketing. On the intentional investments that we've made into the \u2013 primarily it is the Norwegian fleet \u2013 it's a number of soft items : carpets, linens, plates, cutlery. It's standards that Frank has brought in that these are minimum standards that we have to be operating at. There is a lot of soap and water going into that. That is fortunately not stuff we have to expense because we've got the labor. But it's the soft side that we've had to go out and expense. Anything you want to add, Frank? Frank J. Del Rio : Look, I think that we're focused on growing the top line, growing the yields, both in ticket pricing and in onboard. And you have to spend a little money on some areas to be able to facilitate that \u2013 the onboard experience. I will tell you that I think that perhaps there was some under spending in prior years that we're playing a little catch-up on. I think we've done that for the most part in the quarter. The good news is that eight vessels will undergo dry-dock in 2016. I believe another six in 2017, so we have an opportunity when these ships do go into dry-dock to bring them up to the highest level they can be, given the space that they're in across the fleet, whether it's the Norwegian brand or the Regent brand. It will have two dry-docks next year. But we have the youngest fleet in the industry. But some of the vessels are a little bit more seasoned than others and this is the time when \u2013 it's an opportune time for us, I should say, because these dry-docks are coming at the right time where we can go in and bring them back up to as-new condition. But not all vessels are being dry-docked next year. Some are waiting until 2017. So some of these steps that we took in the third quarter, as Wendy mentioned, were \u2013 we spent the money to bring these up in anticipation of the dry-dock occurring in the next 12 months to 24 months. Harry C. Curtis: Okay. That does it for me. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS Securities. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Robin M. Farley: Great. Thanks. I wanted to just clarify, Wendy, from the color that you gave on the cadence of the quarters. That was helpful. Thank you. Were you suggesting that Q1 \u2013 I know there are some things that will make it a more difficult comparison, but it would still be a positive yield quarter year-over-year in Q1? Is that right? Wendy A. Beck: Absolutely. Yes, it will be positive. It's just it's a harder \u2013 it's harder with the number of things that we called out as to the rest of the quarters. So when we give our full year guidance, Q1 will be lower than the other quarters. Robin M. Farley: Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, just to understand the expense timing and \u2013 I understand that the Q3 expense timing, marketing shifting between quarters, but with the full year expenses going up for 2015, is that expenses \u2013 is that like the new offices in China opening earlier? Or I guess, what's the \u2013 it seems like there's a shift of expense between 2016 and 2015? Wendy A. Beck: Yeah. It's still \u2013 there is some additional infrastructure, but primarily it's marketing, as I laid out and then it's also the additional investments into the Norwegian fleet. Specifically, we have the Epic and the Gem dry-dock, so although a portion of that is capitalized, there is more OpEx expense, and those were in addition to what we had originally planned at the beginning of the year. This has definitely been a year of transition. At the time that we planned those dry-docks, it was actually before Frank even came in as the CEO. So as we've gotten into the year and there's been ship inspections by Frank and the management team, they've made intentional investments and decisions as to how can we garner the highest return on those ships and how do we continue to drive pricing, how do we drive guest satisfaction, and so there is additional investments being made into the Norwegian fleet. Robin M. Farley: So with the timing of the \u2013 the dry-docks didn't shift, it's just that you're putting more investment in the dry-docks in Q4 that otherwise would have taken place at some point in 2016 is kind of the idea? Wendy A. Beck: That's correct. And as far as the international infrastructure, it's fairly minimal in Q4. We'll see that start ramping up into 2016. Robin M. Farley: Okay. Great. And then just my last question, with the commitment to send capacity to China, because in many ways as a smaller fleet than some of the others out there, you could have also benefited just by staying in the Caribbean while kind of others went to China. And I know you're taking obviously a longer term view than just sort of that first year or so, but I guess since you're not sourcing passengers from China for Chinese-based cruises right now, I know when you looked into it, you had outside consultants. Can you give us a view on kind of what you're hearing about pricing in China as supply is moving there and kind of what your consultants are telling you, what's taking place with kind of price and the markups with travel sellers in China? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. By all accounts, China will become the second-largest cruise market in the next five years. Within the next 10 years, that could exceed the United States. So waiting much longer was just not an option and given that we had the opportunity to come into the market with a brand-new vessel that really resonates in the marketplace that we're going to customize. We think today there isn't a product in China that is perfectly geared for the Chinese. All the vessels that are in China today were built to go elsewhere, were built for the Western market, and depending on what ship and what brand you're talking about, there was some level of customization made, but not a whole lot. So we believe that although we're coming to China a little bit later than others, we will enter with the best hardware that anybody else has. It will be the biggest ship, it'll be the newest vessel, and it will be customized to a level that no one else has done yet. All the intelligence that we hear from our sources in China is that the bookings remain strong, perhaps not at the strongest level ever as more capacity has come in and has to be digested, but still significantly higher than an alternative western itinerary, whether it's the Caribbean or Alaska or Europe. The Chinese itineraries are outperforming the others. And so, we're very bullish that even though we may not have first move or advantage, we have other advantages. We're learning where others perhaps might have made certain mistakes, would wish they had done things differently. We have the benefit of those, of that history. We have the benefit of introducing a brand new ship. We have the benefit of 18 months of runway until our ship gets there. And so we believe that on par, it's the perfect time to enter the Chinese market with this incredible vessel. And everything we hear is no question the right decision. It's literally a no-brainer. Robin M. Farley: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Steven Wieczynski : Hey, good morning, guys. So, first question will be on Escape. And I think, Frank, you talked about Escape right now is still seeing double-digit yields at this point. But could you maybe compare Escape at this point versus how Getaway was booking at this same point? And maybe also how Escape bookings have trended over the last three to five months, would be helpful as well. Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah, Escape without question, is the most successful introduction in the company's history. She is booked three times deeper than Getaway was at the same time with about the same pricing, so very happy to see that performance. And she has been building strong all along, not just in the last three or four months, but ever since we introduced her, she's been a strong, strong performer. And when can you see her? Hopefully you can come down now over the weekend and see her for yourself. She is truly breathtaking, an amazing vessel. For a ship that size, you would not expect to see the kind of finishes, the kind of upscaleness that you see in this vessel. So we have high hopes that she can continue generating double-digit growth well on to the future. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Great. And then second question will be on the booking curve, I think you talked about how it's 12% longer at this point. But when you look at the industry in general, it seems like all you guys have essentially \u2013 have gotten consumers to book a little bit further out. I guess, I'm just wondering how much \u2013 what else can you do at this point to get people to book even further out? And how much more do you think you can get that booking window to expand at this point? Frank J. Del Rio : Well, I don't think necessarily you want to extend the booking window to infinity. I'd rather raise prices to infinity. And so, I'm very comfortable with the booking window the way it is now. Much more than that you'd probably be leaving yield on the table. So you're never sure what the perfect balance of bookings are, but we'll finish the year, as I said earlier, occupancy in the mid-50s for next year. That's very, very strong, up significantly from where we were this time last year where we will be \u2013 at year-end versus 2014 year-end. So I think that the emphasis will continue to be push prices up, not just ticket pricing, but take advantage of the on board revenue. We've seen very, very strong on board revenue, especially at the Norwegian brand, over the last quarter. And we hope and believe that will continue. It's part of what we learn in the integration and synergy review that we put into place, and we think that's got sustainability. Steven Wieczynski : Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Steven E. Kent: Hi. Good morning. Couple questions, I guess fundamentally it's going to be very hard to understand the earnings momentum of your operations, given all of these moving parts. And just wondered if you had reconsidered showing the performance of Prestige and Norwegian brands separately, because between the dry-docks and the product roll-out, it's going to be almost impossible to get a quarterly progression to assess the power of your brands and fleets from the outside, especially because you have a relatively small base. And then just one other issue, in terms of weakness in Europe, what's underlying that? I mean you mentioned it a couple of times, is it too much supply in the region? Is it that North American consumers are preferring to buy hotel rooms in depreciated euro more than a cruise ticket in U.S. dollar? Frank J. Del Rio : Steve, the answer to your first question is, no. We have not considered that suggestion. In terms of Europe bookings, look there's been some issues in Europe, right? The Eastern Mediterranean has been impacted and has been impacted now for the last several years, so it's a little bit of the cumulative effect. We've got the Black Sea situation. It's still not back to normal with the Crimea situation. We've had several disruptions in Istanbul. The Greek financial crisis did not help the Greek Isles itineraries. There is always tension or there has been more tension than usual in the Israel space, because of the Syrian situation. We've got the refugees spreading across some of the Eastern Mediterranean areas. And then, the strong dollar, as you mentioned earlier, would tend to cause if anything a move away from cruising. Cruising is very, very good when the dollar is weaker, because all your expenses are paid upfront and you don't have to pay for lodging and food. So, I imagine on the margins that the strong dollar has favored land programs versus cruises in Europe this past year. And look, ships have to go somewhere, so there has been a reduction, a slight reduction in capacity out of the Caribbean. The Caribbean is now strong. The weakness might be Europe. There may be more capacity in Europe than there has been in prior years. But on the other hand the Northern Europe remains strong. Western Europe remains strong. Hopefully the Eastern Mediterranean will shape up in the next few months, next years. Steven E. Kent: Okay. See you next week. Frank J. Del Rio : Can't wait. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Tim A. Conder: Thank you. Frank, again just maybe to recap here, if I heard you correctly the catch-up investments that you had here, as far as getting the Norwegian ships up to your standard \u2013 when you want the customer to step on, they want to be \u2013 to perceive the ship as being new continually. For the Jade and so forth that are being dry-docked now, that will effectively be completed? And then as you dry-dock the others, will that affectively complete that raising the standard up to the FDR standards? Frank J. Del Rio : I think you need to look at it over a two-year program. We dry-docked Epic and Gem, and those were extensive dry-docks in Q3, Q4 this year. As Wendy mentioned, we have eight dry-docks next year, two with the Regent brand, one at the Oceania brand, five at the Norwegian brand. And I think \u2013 I know that it will \u2013 that kind of dry-dock heavy schedule will now continue into 2017. I believe that by 2017 every one of Norwegian's ships except the brand new ones will have been dry-docked except for one vessel. So that gives us a very unique opportunity to upgrade the fleet over a short, concentrated time so that the whole brand gets elevated in terms of product delivery and allows us to continue to raise prices more so than if you hadn't done these thing. At the end of the day the consumer is not stupid, the consumer has choices and we think that the ROIC on these kinds of investments is \u2013 outpaces, if you will, the ROIC and the pay back of new vessels. And so, our goal is we've got billions of dollars invested in these ships. You have to maintain them at the highest standards if you expect to achieve these higher yields. And so far we're very pleased with our ability to raise prices, our ability to generate incremental on board revenue and we believe that if the fleet were to be in tip-top condition that will continue. Tim A. Conder: Okay. Totally agree. Totally agree. How should we I guess then think about the portion that will flow through to the P&L over this period versus what we'll call a normal run rate? And then, of course, layering in your \u2013 I think China, your investments, those will probably be ongoing just given the long term and near-term even potential. But if we could maybe break those components out going forward here incrementally and then, of course, they start to fall off in 2017 on the reinvestments. Any color you can give us there? And then, as it relates to \u2013 you talked a little bit about sourcing passengers from China, the reason you opened the three offices for markets outside, itineraries outside of China. How do you see that ramping the Prestige brands versus the Norwegian brands and other global markets for Chinese sourced passengers? Frank J. Del Rio : Well, the Oceania and Regent brands have been sourcing customers out of China. As I mentioned earlier, it's been the largest percentage gainer \u2013 still small numbers, but largest percentage gainers. And we've been doing that sort of as absentee marketers because we did not have a strong presence in China. We've been doing it through general sales agents, et cetera. So now that we have three offices in the major cities in China and Hong Kong, we expect that business to continue to accelerate. The Chinese consumer is sophisticated, has got the wherewithal and if you've been to the major capitals of Europe lately, you see upscale Chinese travelers everywhere. And so, we believe that a natural evolution of the Chinese consumers wanting to travel and seeing the world is to do so on a ship. And so, we're focusing those two brands on that type of consumer. Because the type of Chinese consumer that does travel outside the country on these long haul trips tends to be the more upscale consumer in China, which we believe that the Oceania and Regent brand fit well. But also with The Haven on board, the Norwegian ships, we also believe that that type of consumer will also consider the Norwegian brand. So we're very enthusiastic about entering the Chinese markets, not just for the new vessel that's going into China, but China as a new source for our existing vessels. Wendy A. Beck: And then regarding the expense on upgrading, if you will, the Norwegian fleet, typically we have guided to $7 million to $8 million on the dry-dock expense per Norwegian ship and that would be a good run rate also for our entire fleet. The Pride of America, however, is going to be a more expensive dry-dock. As you know, that that ship is out in Hawaii. We were not able to get into the U.S. Naval Yard there, so we're actually bringing the ship over to San Francisco, which you know five days transit each way plus 14 days gives you the 24 day dry-dock. So that is a little bit more expensive. We will have all of this. We'll give clarity when we give our guidance for 2016. I think the walk away here is that we've said today that we are very comfortable, we're on target to exceed the $5 EPS target for 2017. And everything that we've talked about, the incremental spend on the Norwegian fleet, the offices opening internationally, as we continue to grow all three of the brands, as we move into China, that's baked into our targets that are out there. So as far as giving everyone clarity on that, we will give you clarity. It will be when we rollout \u2013 our next quarter, when we rollout our guidance for 2016. And then it's the same thing with CapEx. We've been running with a run rate of approximately $175 million on a combined basis; this is excluding our new builds. So to the extent that that number is higher as we complete these dry-docks, again we will give you clarity on that, but again that's still baked into our targets, including our 14% ROIC in 2018. Tim A. Conder: Okay. Thank you, Wendy. Thank you, Frank. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Kevin M. Milota: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, but just to beat a dead horse a little bit more here on the net cruise cost. New ship introductions, could you give us the offset \u2013 kind of the offsetting factor for how much more fuel efficient, energy efficient, cost efficient those ships are? And how that might be helpful to net cruise costs next year, just to offset the China investment and the dry-dock spend? Thank you very much. Frank J. Del Rio : New vessels are more efficient on fuel, but net cruise costs are ex-fuel, so I don't see a new ship adding a whole lot of efficiency, if you will, to net cruise costs. They're primarily \u2013 they deliver double-digit yield growth. That's what new vessels bring to the table more so than cost savings. You do get to the spread, your overhead over a broader base of beds and of course that tends to decrease costs overall, but the main driver why you bring new ships on line is the ability to drive double-digit yield growth. Kevin M. Milota: Okay. Wendy A. Beck: And I would just reiterate, Kevin, that, we are right on path with holding our G&A as tight as we possibly can as we continue to bring in new builds. Just as we talked about in the past, we will continue to add sales force. We will add direct agents, res agents, but you're still spreading it over the rest of the corporate office, as Frank said. Kevin M. Milota: And just captured in your $5 EPS number, the underlying net cruise cost increase has not changed is what you're trying to message to all of us? Wendy A. Beck: Correct. We've been messaging 1% to 2%. That's what we're trying to stay in line with. However, we have said there's puts and takes in that $5 target. We already know that there's upside to it, and yet we know that there's incremental investment into China, so we haven't actually quantified yet what is the investment into China and these international offices. But the underlying into the $5 plan is the 1% to 2% net cruise cost. Kevin M. Milota: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Jaime Katz : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about capital allocation now that shares have increased pretty significantly over the last year, and whether or not you've made any changes to your assessment on whether it would be more strategic to pay down debt rather than buy back shares? I mean, how that plays into your $5 price target in 2017? I'm sorry, your $5 earnings target in 2017? Wendy A. Beck: Okay. Great question. So when we originally put the target out there, as you'll recall, it's roughly $100 million of free cash flow that we had assumed at the time of Investor Day that we would actually pay down debt. We've been messaging that towards the back half of this year, we would like to get back out there and repurchase some shares. You'll see in our filings that we actually have embarked upon it in a small way in Q3. As we've said to everyone, we will be opportunistic and we did pick it up at a very nice price, although it's a small amount. We're still on path for that right now. You may see us do a little bit on the debt pay down and you may see us out there also with share repurchases. We will continue to be opportunistic and look at that. Jaime Katz : Okay. And then, as far as the lengthening by brand of the booking curve, has there been any bifurcation you guys have seen across the different brands that you're willing to comment on? I'm just curious if any of the different demographics that you cater to are responding differently? Frank J. Del Rio : No. All three brands are showing an extended booking curve. All three are contributing to that 12% overall extension on the booking curve. Jaime Katz : And then lastly, can you just update us on any changes to capacity growth and either the fourth quarter ahead as the timing of the ship to come on? Wendy A. Beck: Sure. So for fourth quarter, Norwegian Escape is actually contributing to capacity growth of 2.2%. And then, do you need capacity for the outer years, Jamie? Jaime Katz : If you have it. Wendy A. Beck: So, 2016, we're going to be up 11%, that's Escape, Sirena, and Explorer. 2017 up 8%, 2018 9%, and 2019 is 4%. Jaime Katz : Excellent. Thank you so much. Wendy A. Beck: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes... Frank J. Del Rio : Hey, Nicholas, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our last question will come from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush. Your line is now open. Please proceed. Sean Wagner : Hi. This is Sean Wagner on for James Hardiman. With respect to China, the urgency with which you wanted to enter that market has changed since your Analyst Day. Can you walk through how your decision making on China has evolved over the past year? Was it just that you couldn't afford to wait anymore like you had mentioned? Frank J. Del Rio : I don't think it changed. We said that we're going to take a close look, a measured look. We've been working on it all year, but at the end of that study which was very thorough, we concluded that the Chinese market was still the highest yielding market for the introduction of a new vessel, and the one that's growing the fastest. So if it's the highest yielding and the fastest growing, where would you put a new ship? Sean Wagner : All right. Fair enough. Along those lines with several new incremental ships going into that market, at the same time the economy has kind of sputtered there. I understand the short-term demand is outpacing supply, but when do you think the two even out? And has that point moved up considering the ongoing capacity growth in the region? Frank J. Del Rio : There'll be 14 ships in China next year. There'll be 19 in 2017. Not all are year round. We will be there year round. Some of these are seasonal. Even though the general wisdom of the consensus is that the Chinese economy is slowing and may be slowing from the unsustainable pace of double-digit growth that we might have seen 10 years ago, but it's still 7% or so. And it's three times the United States, several times more that of Western Europe. So it's still the safest bet that the Chinese market will continue to grow on an outsized manner and again it has the highest pricing. Chinese consumers got money in their pocket and they want to spend it and we're seeing that in the way that they \u2013 not only buy cruises, but their spending habits on board. The retail spend from everything that we can gather is substantially higher than that from the Western markets. The gaming revenues are substantially higher in the Western market. And so, we believe that all told it is still the best place to enter a new vessel. We think we will have a competitive advantage given the tonnage that we were bringing into the market, being the newest, the largest, the most customized and so we can't wait for 2017 to get here. Sean Wagner : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Frank J. Del Rio : Okay. Frank J. Del Rio : Well, thanks everyone for your time and support today and as always, we will be available to answer your questions. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Abigail, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions for the session will follow at that time. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow with commentary on the results for the quarter and full year 2015, as well as provide guidance for 2016 before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. We will then open up the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com, and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2015 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. I would also like to review information about forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP information as a part of this call. The company's comments today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations. The company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see the company's SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the company's earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by pointing out the song you've been listening to is the new Pitbull hit song, Freedom, which has been rocketing up the charts. As I'm sure you know, Pitbull is the godfather of our newest ship, Norwegian Escape, and the song plays an important role in Norwegian's new Feel Free global ad campaign. I'll talk more about the campaign a little later in the call, but first I'd like to discuss our robust financial results for 2015, talk a little bit about the initiatives we are implementing to keep the strong momentum from 2015 going into 2016 and beyond and give some color on the current business environment as we see it. I'll then hand over the call to Wendy to review 2015 results in more detail and to highlight our 2016 guidance. This past year, we dedicated a great deal of our time formulating, implementing and aligning the go-to-market strategies of Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania and Regent, by focusing on a targeted set of initiatives aimed at driving demand. These initiatives resonated incredibly well and included our market-to-fill approach to pricing, which directs our target market and our past guests to focus on the deal aspect and value proposition of a cruise vacation rather than just on low price. Let me start by reiterating that the company came into 2016 in the best book position in our history. We had more revenue on our books and were better loaded coming into Wave season than ever before and we're better booked in each quarter and for the full year and at higher prices than at any time in our history. We attribute the strong base of booking to our successful go-to-market strategies which have put us in a position of strength as we continue to focus on increasing pricing as we move through the balance of 2016 and into 2017 and which should allow us to achieve constant currency adjusted net yield growth of approximately 4% for the year. Turning for a moment to the macroeconomic environment. There have been several recent headlines which have raised concerns among our stakeholders regarding their possible impacts on our business. First is the Zika virus. Simply put, the impact of Zika virus has been negligible across our brands and we believe based on past experience from similar outbreaks that any remaining concerns will soon subside. Looking at the broader macro picture, in my view the cruise industry as a whole is one of the best harbingers of future economic activity because of the advanced booking curve nature of our business. I already spoke about our record book position coming into 2016. But looking even further ahead, as of last week an early read shows that the first half of 2017 is already approximately 30% more booked and at higher prices on capacity growth of just 5% compared to the same time last year. While we largely attribute this year-over-year growth to the success of our go-to-market strategies and the power of our brands, we would not be experiencing this level of booking activity for sailings over a year out if consumer confidence was not strong. I'd also like to comment on the state of the current and future markets where we operate. First, close-to-home destinations, which rely predominantly on North American-sourced guests, such as itineraries to the Caribbean, Alaska, Bermuda, Hawaii, and Canada, New England (6:30) are performing extremely well. Combined, these markets are more than offsetting softness which we have been experiencing in the Mediterranean, particularly in the Eastern Med since the Paris attacks. After the latest incident in Istanbul, we redeployed all 2016 itineraries that touch Turkish ports across all of our brands to alternate destinations in Greece and Italy. In conjunction with these itinerary changes, we have taken pricing action where necessary and have diverted marketing dollars to help stimulate consumer demand for sailings operating in the region. We are confident that the Mediterranean area, with its unique destinations and world-class attractions, will soon recover and return to its stature as one of the premium regions in our deployment portfolio. Now turning to one of our future endeavors. As you know, we announced our intent to enter the China market in October of last year and we are on track to deploy our upcoming Breakaway Plus Class ship from the Norwegian brand to the region in mid-2017. We are designing a ship customized to the Chinese consumer with features and amenities not only unique to a ship sailing in the Asia region, but unique to any ship sailing anywhere in the world. We also continue to develop and strengthen our relationships with travel partners and are taking the time to learn about the intricacies and nuances of operating in China. These learnings will allow us to tailor not only our product offerings, but also our business and marketing approach with our travel partners so that we can offer the best possible experience and outcomes for all stakeholders. The more we learn about the competitive landscape, the more we continue to be certain that the emerging, evolving and growing Chinese market presents the best opportunity for maximizing fleet-wide profitability and is the best deployment option for new vessels to generate upsized incremental earnings. As a reminder, our $5 adjusted earnings per share target for 2017 did not contemplate our entry into China, meaning that any upside from our entry into China will be accretive to earnings per share beginning in the second half of 2017. Looking now to our results for last year. 2015 marked the first full year of combined operations for the Norwegian, Oceania and Regent brands, and our results for the period demonstrate just how successful a combination this has become. What makes these results more impressive is that they were delivered by a management team who, up until a year ago, weren't even under the same roof. The speed and efficiency with which we merged the two companies' teams and cultures to create today's NCLH is nothing short of remarkable. Most importantly, this flurry of activity we formulated an overarching strategy to make the most out of this combination, which we termed the New Deal. And here is a one-year progress report on how the New Deal is proceeding. As a reminder, there are three tenets to the strategy. The first, build on a steady as she goes approach continues the successful growth strategies that Norwegian had put into place prior to the acquisition of Prestige. One of these strategies, a disciplined new-build program, is a key driver of future growth and the successful launch of Norwegian Escape, the first ship in a Breakaway Plus Class demonstrate our ability to effectively deliver on these fleet introduction. The second tenet, driving higher demand and higher yield, revolves around the various initiatives in the go-to-market strategy that I mentioned in my earlier comment. Although it is the most complex of the three to establish, it is the one where we have demonstrated the most success. Our strong net yield performance in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, which were either entirely or primarily a result of organic growth, as well as our extremely strong book position entering into 2016, demonstrate that these initiatives have already gained traction and are producing outstanding results. Lastly, utilizing our scale to suppress cost is demonstrated by the flattening of our organizational structure as we migrated to a primarily shared services based organization. This structure not only yields monetary savings but more importantly gives us a strategic advantage as it encourages and facilitates the sharing of best practices throughout the organization in a quick and efficient manner. Looking ahead, there are several initiatives that were part of the new deal that are still in their early stages, but which will bear fruit in the coming years. First is rewarding net yield growth from organic sources versus solely relying on growth from newbuilds. While we posted a strong same fleet net yield growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, we are strengthening this initiative by introducing brand specific programs aimed at enriching the guest experience through ship revitalizations, destination enhancements and other investments. Last month Regent announced a program aimed at elevating the experience on its current three-ship fleet to the standards of its upcoming flagship, Seven Seas Explorer. The Norwegian Cruise Line brand introduced The Norwegian Edge, which will see meaningful investments in all the brands ship introduced in 2010 or earlier, as well as enhancements to our land-based, private destinations in the Bahamas and Belize. These initiatives are aimed at stimulating demand and increasing yield on our current fleet, which when coupled with the returns of our future new ship additions, will bolster earnings growth well into the future. Another driver of pricing we expect to gain traction this year is our continued diversification of itinerary. 2016 marks the year whereby we began to slowly wean the Norwegian brand away from its reliance on seven-day milk runs type itineraries. Some examples are : The 2016/2017 winter redeployment of Norwegian Epic with Port Canaveral offering Bahamas and Caribbean voyages of various length; the 2016/2017 winter redeployment of Norwegian Star in Asia and Australia; the summer 2017 redeployment of Norwegian Getaway to one our highest yielding itineraries in the Baltic region; and lastly, the summer 2017 redeployment of Norwegian Jade to run dual homeport Northern Europe itineraries from Southampton, England and Hamburg, Germany to take full advantage of our expanding presence in our major European source market. The diversification of itineraries will inherently boost yield. This is not to say that we're only less bullish on seven nights Caribbean itinerary. On the contrary, our ships in the region are performing extremely well and for good reasons. Norwegian has some of the newest and best hardware selling in the Caribbean, and after The Norwegian Edge enhancements have been fully rolled out, we will have an even stronger presence in this key market. So, to summarize my comments, 2015 was an extraordinary first year for Norwegian as a Combined Company with record results and solid affirmation that our go-to-the market strategies are resonating well in the marketplace. In addition, we will grow our industry-leading return on invested capital to double-digit in 2016 on our path to achieving our stated goal of 14% in 2018. Lastly, we continue to build confidence in upside as we drive to our $5 adjusted earnings per share target in 2017. Now to discuss our strong results for the quarter and year as well as our outlook in more detail, I'll turn the call over to Wendy. Wendy A. Beck: Thanks, Frank. I am extremely pleased to report strong results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015, which as Frank mentioned earlier marks the first full year of operations of the Combined Norwegian and Prestige organizations under one umbrella. I'll begin with a discussion of these results followed by an update on booking trends and then we'll close with our outlook for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2015 and 2014 per Capacity Day metrics on a Constant Currency Combined Company basis, which compares 2015 results for Norwegian against the combined 2014 financial results of Norwegian and Prestige. I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter results, where adjusted earnings per share increased 42% over prior year to $0.51 exceeding the top end of our guidance range. The fleet was primarily driven by higher net yields as the result of higher pricing as well as a benefit from lower fuel prices partially offset by the timing of our repair and maintenance costs. Adjusted Net Yield outperformed our expectations increasing 7.4% and exceeding our guidance of up approximately 5.5%, primarily as a result of strong pricing from same fleet operations as well as a partial quarter benefit from the addition of Norwegian Escape to the fleet. This comes on the heels of strong yield performance in the third quarter where net yields improved 4.7% on solely same fleet operations. On a Constant Currency and as reported basis, Adjusted Net Yield increased 16.9% and 15.2% respectively as a result of the acquisition of Prestige and stronger pricing. Now moving on to costs, Adjusted Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day increased 5.9% or 4.8% on a Combined Company as reported basis, primarily as the result of two scheduled dry-docks in the period compared to no dry-docks in the prior year. The increase was 17.8% and 16.6% on a Constant Currency and as reported basis, respectively mainly due to the addition of Prestige. Turning to fuel expense, our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges decreased 15% to $509 from $599 in the prior year. Excluding the impact of hedges, our fuel price per metric ton was $351 compared to $529 in 2014. Looking back at the full year, 2015 represented another solid year of strong financial performance. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 27% to $2.88 primarily on same fleet operations, building on a 61% increase in 2014, which was driven by record revenue of $4.3 billion representing a 39% increase from the prior year. We are extremely pleased with our results for 2015, even more so given that it was a year with little benefit from new hardware in our fleet. With an increase of 3.7%, Adjusted net yield for the year outperformed expectations and exceeded the high-end of our guidance. On a combined company as reported basis, adjusted net yield was up 2% also surpassing our guidance. This solid net yield performance was driven by strength in markets, such as the Caribbean, Bermuda and Alaska, as well as the overall success of our go-to market strategies, which were implemented earlier in the year. Adjusted net yield increased 20% on a constant currency basis or 18% on an as reported basis, primarily as a result of the consolidation of Prestige as well as the aforementioned strong pricing. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day increased 3.8% or 2.9% on a combined company as reported basis, primarily driven by increased investments in sales and marketing, and product enhancements to drive demand. On a constant currency basis, this metric increased 25% or 24%, as reported, mainly due to the addition of Prestige. As for fuel expense, our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges decreased 13.8% to $539 from $625 in the prior year. Fuel price per metric ton, excluding the impact of hedges was $424 compared to $605 in 2014. Interest expense net was $221.9 million compared to $151.8 million in 2014 mainly due to higher debt balances resulting from the acquisition of Prestige. Now looking to 2016, we entered the year with a record booked position with over 50% of our overall inventory sold as a result of the aforementioned strategy to drive demand. In addition, the booking window continues to improve over prior year, as evidenced in the fourth quarter where it expanded 11%. As Frank mentioned, while still early in the booking cycle, we have seen encouraging trends into early 2017 with a booked position that is 30% higher with more revenue and higher pricing versus the same time last year. Continuing on the subject of strong bookings, Norwegian Escape was extremely well received by guests and travel agents alike and continues to book very well. When compared to the Norwegian brand's other 4,000-plus berth ships launched in the Caribbean, Norwegian Escape remains the best booked at higher prices. As part of our measured fleet expansion program, this year we will welcome Sirena and Seven Seas Explorer into the Oceania and Regent fleets, respectively. The earnings benefit from these additions as well as the full-year benefit from Norwegian Escape will be very evident in our 2016 results. As a result of these fleet additions, total capacity for 2016 is expected to increase approximately 12%. Looking at deployment for 2016, our core business is performing strongly and we see continued strength in the Caribbean, where our two newest ships, Norwegian Escape and Norwegian Getaway, are deployed year-round from Miami. Approximately 43% of our overall capacity is in the Caribbean, which is up approximately 200 basis points from prior year. This has been a strong performing market both in 2015 and so far in 2016, with pricing and load higher year-over-year. Europe, with 22% of our capacity for the year, looks to be a tale of two markets. The Baltic is performing very well, with both occupancy and pricing up nicely. This performance is being offset by softness in Med sailings, which, as Frank mentioned earlier, were impacted by various geopolitical events that have occurred throughout Europe in recent months. Also impacting overall yields is the deployment of Norwegian Epic year-round in Europe. We have already redeployed her for winter 2016, where she will be back in the Caribbean and we expect her to garner higher ticket pricing and enhanced onboard revenue. As for other key markets, our deployment is similar to last year, with Alaska accounting for 7%, Bermuda 6%, Hawaii 4%, and the remainder of our capacity in the Asia, Africa, Pacific region, South America, as well as other voyages. We are seeing particular strength in the key markets which are primarily sourced from North America, which bodes well given the high percentage of guests we attract from the region. While our international expansion strategies have been successful to-date, our current sourcing mix remains heavily skewed toward North American passengers, leaving us less dependent on Europe, Asia and other source markets. In terms of currency sourcing, approximately 85% of revenues are booked in the U.S. dollar. Bookings in local currency are predominantly in euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. A $0.01 change in this basket of currencies is approximately $0.02 in EPS on an annual basis. Now turning to our guidance for 2016. In the first quarter, we executed a purchase and sale agreement for our interest in certain land-based operations in Hawaii. The sale is expected to close in 2016, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. While this transaction is deemed immaterial to our consolidated financial statements, for comparative purposes our guidance excludes the results of these operations for both current and prior year. For your reference, we have provided key metrics for 2015 by quarter and full year excluding these results in our earnings release. As a result of our strong booked position entering the year as well as capacity additions from new ships, we expect an increase in adjusted net yield of approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and approximately 3.5% on an as-reported basis. For the full year 2016, we expect adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day to increase 2.5% on a constant currency basis and 2.25% on an as-reported basis. The increase is mainly due to incremental dry-dock expense year-over-year as well as our investment to expand into the China market. This investment is expected to be approximately $15 million in 2016 and an additional $15 million in the first half of 2017 prior to our ship launch mid-year. Turning to fuel expense. Our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges is expected to be $470 for the year and excluding hedges is expected to be $290. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 60% of our total fuel consumption for 2016 was hedged at an average price per metric ton of $452. We've been opportunistic to layer on incremental hedges in the outer years and, as of year-end 2015, we were 56% hedged for 2017 at an average price of $401, 49% for 2018 at an average price of $357 and 32% hedged for 2019 at an average price of $322. 2016 will be another year of strong financial performance with earnings growth of approximately 30%, with adjusted EPS expected to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 and double-digit ROIC. Now I'd like to walk you through our guidance and expectations for the first quarter. Capacity will be approximately 13% due to the addition of Norwegian Escape, who joined our fleet in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 2.5% on a constant currency basis or 1.75% on an as-reported basis. It is important to note that this net yield performance is inclusive of a 24-day dry-dock of Pride of America, the highest yielding ship in the Norwegian brand, as well as the impact from the deployment of Norwegian Epic in Europe during the non-peak shoulder season. Excluding these items, yield would have been approximately 75 basis points to 100 basis points higher. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to increase 2% on a constant currency basis and 1.75% on an as-reported basis. And adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.39. As we continue to execute on our strategies to increase returns on our existing fleet while also taking delivery of new vessels with attractive earnings profiles, we expect to drive incremental shareholder value and continue to broaden the spread between our adjusted return on invested capital and our weighted average cost of capital, which at year-end were 9% and 8.4%, respectively. We remain committed to driving growth and delivering strong results while continuing to be opportunistic with share repurchases under our previously authorized $500 million program, of which $313.5 million remains available as of December 31, 2015. With that, I'll turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy. With the integration of Norwegian and Prestige well behind us, our team can now focus 100% on executing on our long-term strategy and developing complementary initiatives to drive further growth in our business. A case in point is the Feel Free global campaign launched last month with the Norwegian brand. It brings a straightforward message that translates well in all markets around the world and bolsters Norwegian's attribute of freedom and flexibility. At the same time, we are delivering on our disciplined newbuild program with the addition of Sirena to the Oceania Cruises fleet and the already legendary Seven Seas Explorer to the Regent fleet. Lastly, Norwegian's three brands continue to work together to align strategies and home processes by showing best practices ranging from the best way to deploy digital marketing initiatives to producing world-class entertainment across our fleet, to developing preliminary programs that are best-in-class. Both Wendy and I wish we had more time to discuss just how much activity is going on at Norwegian in our drive to at least $5 adjusted earnings per share in 2017 and 14% return on invested capital in 2018, but we want to leave time for your questions. So, operator, I'll ask you to now please open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open. Harry C. Curtis: Hi, good morning. Frank, can you talk about one of the concerns over the past six weeks about China that there's just simply too much supply coming and not enough demand or infrastructure to fill that capacity? Frank J. Del Rio : I've heard those comments. I'm probably not the best expert to articulate what may be happening on the ground today because, as you know, we don't get there until another 18 months from now. But I got to tell you, Harry, that everything that I've seen, everything that my team on the ground sees, the discussions we're having with the big-charter travel agents, operators, it reinforces our belief that overall there is no better place to deploy a new vessel, like we are deploying in 2017, than in China. Harry C. Curtis: Can you talk a little bit more about diversifying the sourcing away from the charters and your perception of how the travel agent system is building and kind of the financial incentives for the reasons why that system should build pretty quickly? Frank J. Del Rio : Well, I think it's at this stage more of a wish and a hope by the operator that it evolves into a more diversified multi-channel way of doing business than the singular charter. But I got to tell you, from our perspective, entering the market as we are for the first time, I think it works to Norwegian's advantage to have a very concentrated group of travel agents that are mainly responsible for the ultimate distribution of the product. Perhaps years from now when we have four or five vessels, I will probably think differently. But entering this market pretty much as a start-up in China, I kind of favor the existing very one-sided model because it allows me to focus all my attention on a known group of distributors as opposed to trying to introduce a brand in a populace of over a billion people. So for guys like me, it may not be the worst thing in the world. Harry C. Curtis: Very good. And then I just had a quick question on costs. There was some talk after the Prestige merger of some cost savings, really long-tail cost savings such as contract renewals. Can you give us a sense of where those are at this point? How much savings is still possible based on further synergies? Frank J. Del Rio : We mentioned probably six months ago that the formal synergy program was over. We've, I believe, done an excellent job in identifying those major contracts. Contracts have long-life in some cases. They're not all up for renewal in 2015 or in 2016, and we continue to believe that as more of these contracts come up for renewal that the combined volume that we bring to a particular vendor, a particular contract will be helpful in renegotiating new terms at a lower cost. Wendy A. Beck: And I would just add to that, Harry, that I think in the beginning, what you might be alluding to is taking out maybe the hotel operations contractor on Prestige, and we have decided to keep that in place. But instead, what we've done is we've really pulled our buying power and we're working very well together not just on the Prestige side, but also logistics for the entire fleet. Harry C. Curtis: Very good and nice results. Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio : Thanks, Harry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, good morning. Thank you and thanks for all the great color you provided on the call. Wendy, I believe you said that for the first quarter, just in reference to the dry-dock and some other items, that yields would have been 75 basis points to 100 basis points higher. For the full year, I believe you still have some higher dry-docks than you had last year. So for the full year, what would that yield impact be? Wendy A. Beck: So all of the other dry-docks throughout the year, if you look at dry-docks this year versus last year, they pretty much roll over each other. So the largest impact is when you pull out the Pride of America in Q1, Felicia, partly because it's a 24-day dry-dock, partly because it's also the highest yielding ship on Norwegian. So, on a full year basis, if you pulled that out, it's probably about 10 basis points to 15 basis points. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Thanks. And then just while we're talking about the full year, in the past you guys have said that the company could generate net yield growth of 2% to 3% in an organic year and 3% to 4% in the year when there's a new ship. So if three ships coming in this year, is it fair to say that these three new ships account for 100 basis points of yield to the forecast? Because it sounds like the legacy fleet and everything that you've done is performing well also. Frank J. Del Rio : You've got to take them one at a time. Certainly, Escape is proving to be as good as her billing and consistent with what we've said in the past about new vessels entering the Norwegian fleet. Sirena on the Oceania brand is performing on par with the other three sister vessels that are identical to Sirena. So not really accretive, but just more of the good high yields that those kind of vessels produce. And Explorer is doing very well, although she's only going to contribute to about 5.5 months worth of business. But to give you an idea, she is in the Mediterranean in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. And in spite of the challenges that we see in the Mediterranean, she is booked at yields roughly 50% higher than a sister Regent vessel is generating in the Mediterranean during the same time. So clearly, that is a huge driver. But remember that that vessel is only a 750-passenger vessel. So, on a weighted average basis, even though she books as well as I mentioning to her the overall impact on the annual yield growth is minimal. Wendy A. Beck: And I would just add that that kind of helps counterbalance the Norwegian Escape, where obviously Norwegian ships are at a lower yield than the Oceania and the Regent ships. But again, Felicia, if you take 3% to 4% is the number that we've always guided to in a year that we bring in ships, that's a midpoint of 3.5%, we're guiding to 4% on a Constant Currency basis, which I think really points to the fact that we have really been growing the organic fleet. Felicia Hendrix : Thank you for that color. And then just last thing, little housekeeping. When you guys talk about 2017, your outlook for earnings to exceed $5, I was just curious, are you assuming stock buybacks in it? Wendy A. Beck: No, we are not. So the guidance for 2016 does not assume buybacks. In the original $5 plan, however, there was just under $800 million of free cash flow that we showed at that time to pay down debt, but not specifically buybacks. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley: Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is I wonder if you could talk a little bit about expense drivers in Q4 came in I guess a little bit higher than guidance, which would have been something other than the dry-docks that you would have had in the plan, I guess. And similarly, for 2016, when we sort of quantify what the dry-dock increase is and the China expense, there may be some there expenses that are up, and I know the whole Norwegian Edge program, most of that's going to be showing up in CapEx. So maybe you could just give a little color on what the other expense drivers are. Wendy A. Beck: Sure. So on Q4, there were some partly repairs and maintenance, some timing items and additional investments. Clearly you've seen the benefit as we've made investments, primarily into the Norwegian brand in 2015 and what it's done to drive demand and yields. On the 2016 side of costs, there are a number of puts and takes there, but clearly we are investing in China, we called that out, that's $15 million for 2016 for the cost of investing and the ship comes in in mid-2017 where we'll then get the benefit. There is about $20 million on the additional dry-docks, there is a little bit more interest in some FX, and then we also have a tailwind on the fuel side. Robin M. Farley: And maybe some other non-fuel operating expense items in there because, if I backed out China and the dry-docks, it seems like expense would still be up excluding fuel on the operating side? Wendy A. Beck: Yeah, somewhat. But overall I would say that we're doing everything we can to keep \u2013 if you take out China and the additional dry-dock expense, we would actually be sub-1% in our growth in net cruise cost, Robin. So we're doing everything we can to manage down those costs. And you are correct, by the way, on The Norwegian Edge program. There has been a little bit of misunderstanding there as to how we get to those numbers. But keep in mind that we have always been out there saying post the acquisition that we have about $175 million in what we would call maintenance CapEx for the combined fleets. So The Norwegian Edge and the Regent program, those span two years so you've got $175 million times two. We also have been opportunistic to lock in FX hedges on our new-builds. So there's a few puts and takes, but overall our CapEx guidance has not changed because we're managing through that. Robin M. Farley: Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then just lastly, can you give a little more color around the Hawaiian land-based operation that you bought and just what that will do to revenue and expenses? Is that accretive at the bottom line and that kind of thing? Wendy A. Beck: Sure. So it's about $32 million a year in revenue and about $5 million per year to the bottom line, so pretty immaterial. And it actually is dilutive to our yields as we bring in additional capacity. So what we've tried to do there is just make sure that we excluded assuming that the sale will go through and it'll be out some time in 2016 and give you all the color to get your models right by quarter. Robin M. Farley: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Steven Wieczynski : Hey. Good morning, guys. So, Frank, I guess going back to the 2017 guidance of $5, it now sounds like you're a little bit more favorable going north of $5. And you said that didn't contemplate any entry into China. So I guess the question is, does that now contemplate China? Is it better fundamentals? Is it lower fuel? I'm just trying to get at why is that a little bit better versus $5 right now. Frank J. Del Rio : So, yes, it did not include China. The $5 was introduced about a year ago. So lots of moving parts any time you are predicting what's going to happen two years down the road. But everything that we see today, we have greater confidence than ever that the $5 earnings per share at a minimal will be reached. We think China will be accretive. We think that, if fuel remains at the levels it is today, it will be accretive. not on a dollar-for-dollar basis because don't forget our unfavorable hedges. But nevertheless, we've also netted higher synergies than was contemplated when we put out the $5 back in February/March of last year. But then, of course, the biggest driver of all is the confidence that we're seeing in the advance booking. To be up 30% on higher pricing is very comforting. And we have yet to see the full effect of all the itinerary changes that we've announced because some don't take effect until late 2016 and early 2017 and some don't take effect until mid-2017, which also were not included. We believe that the move of Getaway alone to Scandinavia could have an impact of just under $0.10 a share. So we see a lot of good reasons why that $5 is coming into focus very nicely. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. And then the second question would be in terms of this year. How are you guys viewing onboard spend? And have you seen any weakness in onboard spend in the last two months, three months? Frank J. Del Rio : We had a very, very strong Q4 in onboard spend leading up to the holidays. We saw a little dip at the beginning of the year, and it's typical. I think it's a little bit of the hangover from New Year. But over the last three weeks or so, we've seen it pick up back to where we expected it to be. So there's no headline there, at least not yet. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. And then last question real quick. Have you guys bought back any stock in the first quarter? Wendy A. Beck: We will continue to be opportunistic and we will be buying back shares most likely in Q1. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Your line is open. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Great. Thanks. Just on Europe, when you mention that the recent geopolitical events as well as currency could have an impact of about $0.10, I'm just wondering the breakout between currency versus the geopolitical issues impacting itineraries (46:34)? Wendy A. Beck: Yeah, good question. So it's about half and half. $0.05 of that would be related to the impact of Turkey and $0.05 would be on the FX. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Perfect. And are you noticing any differences between North American-sourced passengers going to the Med versus European-sourced passengers going on Med as well as European itineraries? Is there any difference in behavior and demand? Frank J. Del Rio : Greg, we see that the North American passenger up to now \u2013 we think it will change throughout the spring and summer, but up to now we see the North American passenger being a little more hesitant to book an Eastern Mediterranean itinerary than if you are a European-sourced guest. And that's very consistent with what we've seen in prior events similar to what we're facing now. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Makes sense. And then finally, just the Caribbean, it's strong, it's very strong and that's pretty consistent within the industry. What's the key driver for that continued strength? Frank J. Del Rio : Well, there is I think various reasons. One, people want to go on vacation, they want to cruise. So if a person is perhaps hesitant to go to the Eastern Mediterranean, they'll go to the Caribbean instead. So weakness in one theater of deployment will be offset by strength in the other. I also think that in the case of Norwegian, we've got our best hardware there. People want to try the Escape; people want to try the Getaway and Breakaway. And I think that our marketing is resonating, it's upbeat. It's just consistent with the overall fun nature of the Caribbean, and there has not been any reason not to go to the Caribbean. So it's always going to be the largest deployment theater for the cruise industry and it's been consistently in the mid 40s-% of capacity, and I think to some degree the demand has sort of filled up to that capacity over the years. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kevin M. Milota: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here. One, hopefully, you could give us the capacity increases. You gave us the first quarter and full year, but maybe second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter capacity increases? And also talk through the cadence of net yields, can you give us some expectations on where you see net yields, how they're flowing through the year given the new ship introductions in the second quarter and the third quarter? Thank you very much. Wendy A. Beck: Great. Hi. So the capacity growth for Q2 is approximately 11%, Q3 15%, and Q4 11%. And then on the cadence for yields, it will be the highest in Q3. I've likened it to a bell curve in the past and it's still similar to bell curve and then Q2 would be the next highest, Q1 would be the third highest and then Q4 would be the lowest, but that's because we're rolling over such high numbers in Q4 2015. Kevin M. Milota: Okay. Thank you very much. Wendy A. Beck: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim A. Conder: Thank you. First of all, again, Frank and team, congrats on the great execution. Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you. Tim A. Conder: And also, all the color, to echo some previous comments on that. Most of my questions have been answered. But a couple clarifications, Wendy, the $20 million in incremental dry-docks that we're going to see in 2016, should we assume \u2013 I know you've got some accelerated dry-docks in the first half of 2017, but on an annual basis, should we assume that that should go more back to normal i.e. that $20 million go away in 2017 is the first question. And then, Frank, on China, just to clarify, the $5 plus in EPS that you're commenting on earlier. You said the incremental shift is not included but does that include the 2015 of incremental expense that you called out? Frank J. Del Rio : No. It did not. So, China was just not contemplated when the original $5 forecast was disclosed. Tim A. Conder: Okay. Wendy A. Beck: And then, Tim, regarding the dry-dock, so it's a dry-dock versus a dry-dock 2016 versus 2017. Maybe slightly less in cost in 2017 due to the Pride of America dry-dock. Tim A. Conder: Okay. And then back to the question on share repo and debt reduction. Again, you commented on what was and was not contemplated related to the $5 plus target there. Has anything changed, as you see it now, related to your plans on debt pay down and in your thought process there? Wendy A. Beck: Well, I think as we talked to all of our investors, we've got a weighted average cost of debt of roughly 3.9%. It's hard to choose to pay down debt at those kind of rates. We have been out there, as you've seen, being opportunistic and also participating with secondary offerings. So, I think that's where our focus is at this time, especially with the rates where our stock is. Tim A. Conder: Okay. Okay. That's what we thought. Thank you very much. Wendy A. Beck: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Vince Ciepiel : Great. A couple on the business. The first, you've mentioned a nice increase in the outside sales force in the past. Could you help us understand what payback you're seeing now that you've had a few quarters to digest that and specifically California and Canada, how has that business changed for you over the last 6 months to 12 months? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. I'm glad you asked. We made a big deal at about this time last year. And through the fourth quarter, our California business was up 20% and Canada was up 19%. So, we thought that was a very good ROI, especially to get to those levels ramped up as quickly. And so I expected that trend to continue through 2016 with the new ship introductions, et cetera. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. And then the 30% increase for the first half of 2017, I think it was you mentioned as being indicative of consumer confidence. How much of that 30% increase do you think is an industry-wide thing or a lengthening of the booking curve versus maybe some things you're doing specifically within the business and a payback from new ad campaign or other changes you've made? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. I don't know. Those aren't the kind of things that I discuss with competitors. But my sense is that a high tide raises all boats, as they say. And if we're doing well into the future, my instinct is that others are as well. We're not doing anything particularly different for 2017 departures that we're not doing for 2016. It seems to resonate well in the market place. As I said earlier, the only difference between 2016 and 2017 are some itinerary changes that we discussed earlier that we think are going to be accretive to yields and therefore to earnings. But I think it just shows a fundamental strong demand by consumers for cruise vacation. We all know what's the pundits have been saying about the overall economy and the threat of recession, et cetera, et cetera, but I've always believed that the cruise industry because of our elongated booking curve is a very strong indicator of future our economic activity and I hope that what we're seeing for 2017 carries on and it proves out (55:32) that the economy remains strong. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio : Okay, Abigail, we have time for one more question please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi. Good morning. Frank J. Del Rio : Good morning. Wendy A. Beck: Good morning. Jared Shojaian : Frank, there seems to be some debate philosophically about how luxury brands performed during recession. You've got one camp that will say luxury is more cyclical because it deals with higher dollar pricing, and then the other camp will say luxury is less cyclical because you have higher net worth incomes. Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. Jared Shojaian : So, I think based on comments you've made in the past, you lean towards the latter. But my question is what sort of data can you share just to compare Oceania and Regent versus some of the contemporary brands just historically over the last few recessions? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio : If you go back to 2008, 2009 with the great recession, most cruise lines out there today have yet to reach their pre-recession yield. I think that's the best indicator of how resilient the brands are in case of a downturn and that's because most brands react by reducing pricing when natural demand dries up. The Oceania and Regent brands didn't do that, our go-to-market strategy is to not focus on discount but to focus on spending more marketing dollars to stimulate demand. As a result, Regent returned to its high watermark. I think, Regent never missed a year, every year was a record year in yields and Oceania missed it in 2009 and got back in 2010. So from Oceania and Regent's perspective, I will tell you that, the upscale brands are more resilient to the downturn. Even though Norwegian brand, on a standalone basis, got back to their pre-recession yields in 2011. And so I think a lot has to do with management and how they react to the situation and we're very pleased that we keep growing yields because we never had to climb that steep full back up from deep discounting. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Great. Thanks, that's helpful. And then, lastly, we know there's a lot of incremental luxury capacity coming on later this year, whether that's in Viking or Seabourn and even yourself. So can you just update us on what you're seeing on the yield side and in the luxury premium segment? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. I think that the bigger impact on yields in the upscale segment is not so much the capacity increase as you mentioned, but the geopolitical situation in the Eastern Med, the Med. That's the area where a lot of upscale inventory goes to in the second quarter and third quarters. And with that area having the negative impact, I think that's having a bigger impact on yield than whether one or two or three ships are entering the marketplace. Jared Shojaian : Okay, great. Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio : Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for your time and support. As always, we will be available to answer your questions later today. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions for the session will follow at that time. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Latoya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today is Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow to discuss results for the quarter, as well as provide guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2016 before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on our Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com, and will be available for replay 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2016 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. I would also like to review information about forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial information as a part of this call. The company's comments today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations. The company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see the company's SEC filings. In addition, some of our commentary may reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in the company's earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea. And good morning, everyone. The reporting of first quarter earnings are customarily the most anticipated of the year, it's the quarter that gives us a first blush of actual results, and begins to provide a clear picture as to expectations for the year ahead. This year, our first quarter report is no exception. And it is doubly exciting as it means that we are one quarter closer to achieving a double-digit adjusted return on invested capital at the end of 2016. And while I know, Wendy will review our first quarter results in more detail later in the call. I would like to call out a few highlights that demonstrate, just how stronger quarter it was. We posted strong yield growth of 3.6%, which while impressive doesn't fully capture the whole story of just how strong our underlying business really is. This healthy yield growth comes as a result of strong overall pricing from solid Caribbean demand and better than expected onboard revenue. And if not, for the following two factors would have been even higher. First, as we have stated several times in the past, the decision to deploy Norwegian Epic one of the brand's largest and best performing ships and a strong generator of onboard revenue to sail Western Mediterranean Canary Islands at Canary's in a relatively weak first quarter and second quarters was a drag on yield growth. And second, was the plan dry-docks of Norwegian brand highest yielding ship, Pride of America as part of the line Norwegian Edge refurbishment initiative. If not for these two factors, we estimate that adjusted net yield growth in the quarter would have exceeded 5%. Pride of America is now out of dry-dock with improvements and enhancements that may create better shift in the day she was delivered. In addition and as a result of our itinerary optimization strategy, beginning in fourth quarter of this year, Norwegian Epic will be redeployed back to the Caribbean, where we expect that she will garner the ticket premiums and strong onboard revenue that made her a game changer, when she first joined the Norwegian fleet in 2010. So, looking to more current events, a little over a week ago, I had the honor of welcoming the latest additions to Oceania Cruises' award-winning fleet. Sirena was christened in a ceremony in Barcelona and joined sister R-class ships, Regatta, Insignia, and Nautica to form a fleet of four mid-sized 684 berth ships that deliver exceptional onboard experiences, destination which itineraries in the finest cuisine at sea. Being the new kid in the block have these advantages and Sirena is the first of our R-class vessels to incorporate features from the next generation of ships in Oceania suite. Among these features are, the addition of popular Asian eatery Red Ginger with cuisine representative of the Pacific Rim. The all new Italian steakhouse concept, Tuscan Steak and Jacques Bistro, the first dedicated offering on our R-class fleet from Oceania's Executive Culinary Directory, the legendary chef, Jacques P\u00e9pin, whose daughter, Claudine, served as Sirena's godmother. Sirena is the latest example of our strategy to introduce successful offerings to my most modern ships to the rest of our fleets, whether it be Oceania, Regent or Norwegian and I'm sure that our guests who sail on her, will appreciate these expanded offerings. Sirena is spending her inaugural season sailing a diverse set of itineraries in Mediterranean or her deployment delivered a 30% plus increase in capacity in Regent for Oceania. This short capacity increase, however comes at time, when as you know, European sailing are under pressure. The cumulative impact of successive events across Europe in the past month have indeed affected booking patterns for sailings in the Regent, particularly among North American consumers, who comprise the majority of our sourcing pools. The weaker demand from high spending North Americans has increased our reliance on local European sourcing, which have historically booked closer in and at lower prices and with lower onboard spend. This weaker demand and the resulting shift in sourcing, coupled with the increased capacity in Europe for our premium Oceania brand and Norwegian Epic's winter season deployment in Europe have resulted in our tempered expectations for the second quarter. And while the yield growth story for Q2 is not what we expected coming into the year, there are a number of very positive factors providing a solid foundation for the balance of 2016 and beyond. First, is the runaway success of Seven Seas Explorer, which debut in the Mediterranean in July of this year. She broke single-day and multi-day sales record at Regent and is almost entirely booked for inaugural season. I recently visited her at the yard and she will certainly live up to her billing as the most luxurious ship ever built, justifying the record high per diems, she is garnering. Second, we have a lengthy full ship charter of Norwegian Getaway at significant premium above her normal rate. This charter will also shift capacity out of the non-peak Miami-based Caribbean season in the third quarter and should bolster pricing for Norwegian brand's newest ship, Norwegian Escape, which is also based in Miami or Caribbean sailing. Third is the continued strong demand from North American consumers for sailing in markets closer to home, mainly those in the Caribbean, Alaska, Bermuda, Hawaii and New England. And those sailings comprised close to 60% of our capacity in the back half of the year. The combination of a premium price 40-day charter for Norwegian Getaway and strongly booked inaugural seasons for the high yielding Sirena and Seven Seas Explorer combined to lock-in approximately half of our yield growth in the back half of the year. After the fact of the majority of sailings in the back half are in strong performing North American markets further solidified our positive expectations for the third quarter and fourth quarters of 2016, where pricing is up mid-to-high single-digits with occupancies slightly down. These positive expectation also do not take into account the opportunity for potential upside for Europe sailings where we believe the worst of the slowdown is behind us as we have seen positive booking traction in the last four weeks and remain hopeful that the momentum continues. Lastly, adding to this momentum is a fine tuning of our pricing strategy to capture more business at favorable rates. Our disciplined pricing strategy focuses guests on value versus price and is a major driver in not only achieving the industry's highest yields, but also the industry's highest yield growth since our initial public offering. For months now, the Norwegian brand has successfully bundled value-added packages such as unlimited beverage and dining in its cruise fares. First in its freestyle choice offers then in its free-at-sea promotions to the majority of its guests who recognize the outstanding value proposition of these programs. One lesson learned, however, over the last few months revolved around online travel agents or OTAs, which are one of the main distribution channels for selling close-in inventory. One of the drawback of this channel is its difficulty in effectively communicating non-price dependent offers to consumers. When guests search for cruise options online, the Norwegian brand where at times at a competitive disadvantage, as our value-packed pricing would appear higher versus competitors for similar itineraries even though our overall value was much greater. We took this opportunity to introduce sail-away rates on the lowest level category of each stateroom type excluding suite, which represents less than 10% of Norwegian's inventory. Sail-away rates are cruise-only rates with no value-add, which will allow us to capture business that we temporarily were not capturing and while these fares appear to be at lower price points in third-party pricing survey, the cruise fares result in net ticket yields that are generally equal to those of our bundled free-at-sea fares. To summarize, we expect our strong book position, coupled with continued robust demand for North American itineraries and our enhanced pricing strategy, will result in strong yield growth in the back half of the year compensating for the moderate yield growth in the second quarter. Our expected full-year growth of 4% in 2016 is even more impressive given that in prior-years' yields grew 4.7% and 7.4% in the third quarter and fourth quarters, respectively. There were several other highlights in the first quarter, including the first reveal of exciting activities and features on our upcoming China dedicated ship, Norwegian Joy, which I'll cover more detail in my closing comment. But now to discuss the result and outlook in more detail, I'll turn the call over to Wendy. Wendy? Wendy A. Beck: Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2016 and 2015 per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our first quarter results, where I'm pleased to report, yet another strong quarter of financial performance. Adjusted earnings per share increased 41% to $0.38, coming in at the top end of our guidance range of $0.34 to $0.39. Strength in the quarter was a result of higher net yields from higher pricing as well as lower than anticipated net cruise costs excluding fuel. Strong pricing in the Caribbean, which comprised 65% of our capacity in the first quarter coupled with strong onboard revenue in the period drove outperformance in adjusted net yield, which increased 3.6%. On an as-reported basis, adjusted net yields were up 2.5%. This outperformance is particularly impressive given the year-over-year comps Frank discussed earlier. Now looking at cost, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day, increased 1.5% or 1.1% on an as reported basis. Turning to fuel, our fuel expense per metric ton net of hedges decreased 16.7% to $438 from $526 in the prior-year. At face value, fuel expense net appears to be favorable versus guidance for the quarter by $1.6 million. However, when combined with a $5.2 million realized loss in other income and expense related to a portion of our fuel hedge portfolio which was deemed ineffective, all-in fuel expense was unfavorable by $3.6 million in the quarter as a result of the increase in fuel pricing for our unhedged fuel consumption. Taking a look below the line, interest expense net was $59.8 million compared to $51 million in the prior-year mainly due to higher interest rates as a result of an increase in LIBOR rates as well as an increase in average outstanding debt balances primarily associated with the delivery of Norwegian Escape. As for other income expense, there are a few puts and takes impacting this line item. First was the aforementioned loss on our fuel derivatives of $5.2 million. Second was a loss of $4.2 million from the mark-to-market impact of foreign denominated advance ticket sales, which will benefit future periods in the form of higher recognized revenue. These losses were more than offset by a gain from the fair value increase related to a foreign exchange collar for the Seven Seas Explorer newbuild, which we customarily adjust out of earnings. Excluding the $4.2 million non-operational translation loss, adjusted EPS would have been $0.02 higher or $0.40 in the period, further demonstrating our strong underlying operational performance. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we have executed an agreement to divest our land-based operations in Hawaii, which we expect to finalize in 2016, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Our guidance provided excludes the results of the aforementioned land-based operations and since the sale is yet to be finalized, results for the first quarter include this land-based operation. The following key metrics back out the land-based operation from first quarter results to provide an apples-to-apples comparison to guidance. Adjusted net yield growth on a constant currency basis would have been 3.9% compared to guidance of approximately 2.5%; and on an as-reported basis 2.7% compared to guidance of approximately 1.75%. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day growth on a constant currency basis would have been 1.6% compared to guidance of approximately 2%; and on as-reported basis, 1.3% compared to guidance of approximately 1.75%. Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged. Taking a look at markets and deployment around the world, we see continued strength in the Caribbean, where Norwegian's two newest ships, Norwegian Escape and Getaway are deployed year-round from Miami. For the second quarter, approximately 37% of our overall capacity is in the Caribbean from 29% in the prior-year due to the addition of Norwegian Escape to our fleet. Europe accounts for 26% of our capacity for the second quarter and while comparable to prior-year. As for other key market, Alaska accounts for 11%, Bermuda 7%, Hawaii 5% with the remainder of capacity in the Asia/Africa Pacific regions, South America repositioning sailings and other voyages. Now, I'd like to walk you through our guidance and expectations for the second quarter and full-year 2016. As a reminder, due to the pending sale of our land-based operations in Hawaii, our guidance and sensitivities exclude the results of this operation for both current and prior-year. In addition for you reference, in our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, we provided key metrics for 2015 by quarter and full-year excluding these results to assist with modeling on a like-for-like basis. Starting with the second quarter, capacity will be up approximately 10% due to the addition of Norwegian Escape, who joined our fleet in October of last year and Oceania, Sirena, who joined the fleet post her dry-dock at the end of April. As previously mentioned, the weakness in European itineraries has tempered our expectations and adjusted net yields as expected to increase approximately 1.75% or 1.5% on an as reported basis. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to increase approximately 6.25% or 6% on an as reported basis, primarily due to the year-over-year timing of scheduled dry-docks, which we have noted on previous calls. There are four regularly scheduled dry-docks in the quarter compared to only one in the prior-year, which equates to a six-fold increase in dry-dock days, resulting in higher net cruise costs in the quarter. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $480 with expected consumption of approximately 175,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.85. As for the full-year, expectations remain unchanged for our three key metrics. Adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 4% or 3.5% on an as reported basis. The cadence of adjusted net yield growth is led by the third quarter, which will have the highest growth benefiting from the addition of Seven Seas Explorer, and Sirena to the fleet as well as the 40-day charter of Norwegian Getaway. In order of growth, the third quarter is followed by Q1 then Q4 and finally Q2. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to increase approximately 2.5% or 2.25% on an as reported basis. As for cadence of growth, the second quarter will have the largest growth followed by the first quarter, then the third quarter and finally the fourth quarter. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $460 with expected consumption of approximately 715,000 metric ton. As of March 31, 2016, we had hedged approximately 92%, 82%, 55% and 50% of our total projected fuel consumption for the remainder of 2016, and the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively at an average price per metric ton of $380, $361, $356, and $309. We opportunistically layered on incremental hedges throughout the first quarter including new hedges, from marine gas oil or MGO, which we had not previously hedged. As a result of our ability to now hedge both our major fuel consumption types, our overall fuel hedge position significantly increased. To illustrate our strong operational performance, had we not entered into a majority of our hedges prior to the steep decline in fuel prices, expected adjusted net income for the year would have been approximately $120 million higher, adding an additional $0.52 to earnings per share. Taking all of this into account, our expectations for adjusted EPS for the full-year remains unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85. There are few other key metrics that I would like to touch upon. Our balance sheet remains in great shape and we expect to be approximately four times levered on an as reported basis or approximately 3.7 times on a pro forma basis by the end of this year, as we naturally de-lever, bringing it into our targeted leverage range of three times to four times. As for capital allocation, we opportunistically repurchased $50 million in the quarter under our previously authorized $500 million share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2016, $264 million remained available in the program; and while we will remain opportunistic for the remainder of 2016, we anticipate larger share repurchases in 2017 as we balance our share repurchase program, leverage target and liquidity profile. With that, I'll turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy. We are excited about our newbuild program, which adds a new vessel to our fleet each year through 2020. While we recently took delivery of Sirena for the Oceania fleet and anxiously await the delivery of Seven Seas Explorer in July, the most exciting update in our newbuild program was perhaps the announcement of some of the luxurious accommodations and thrilling features and activities of our first purpose-built ship for the Chinese market, Norwegian Joy. Based on the successful design of our Breakaway Plus Class Ships, Norwegian Joy will be styled to appeal to Chinese travelers and include everything from Norwegian brand's largest upscale shopping venue and multiple casinos to an increase in staterooms designed specifically for families, as well as interconnected staterooms for extended families travelling together. The ship will include a number of berths within Norwegian brand, including concierge level accommodations which feature larger balcony staterooms, with luxurious in-suite amenities, the services of a dedicated concierge in an exclusive concierge lounge with private bar and light food offerings available throughout the day. The concierge level is a complement to the brand's luxurious, The Haven by Norwegian suites complex, which also will be part of Norwegian Joy's collection of accommodation and has been expanded to include a VVIP casino. At-sea-first will abound the Norwegian Joy, including a two level, eight turn electric car race track at the very top of the ship and a Galaxy Pavilion complete with numerous immersive virtual reality experiences drilling simulator rides into active video walls, hover craft bumper cars, and a single seat, genuine Formula One race car that's been converted into a state-of-the-art racing simulator among other exciting activity. If you'd like to learn more about Norwegian Joy's features, I invite everyone to visit our dedicated microsite at www.ncl.com/norwegian-joy. By the time of our next call, Seven Seas Explorer will have joined the Regent fleet, as the most luxurious ship at sea. As I had mentioned earlier, her popularity was so great, that she broke records and sold out many voyages, as soon as sails were open. And mind you, these initial sails were open only to members of Regents loyalty program. A sails opened to other gaps, her popularity only grew. So much though that in March of this year, we announced an order for a sister vessel to be delivered in 2020. We are very bullish on these highly anticipated Explorer class vessels and look forward to the first addition entering our fleet this July. The introduction of Norwegian Joy, Sirena, and Seven Seas Explorer along with our disciplined pricing strategy, deployment, optimization and cost containing initiatives are a few of the many factors, which reinforce our confidence in our long-term earnings per share and return on invested capital target. But perhaps the biggest factor contributing to our confidence is our strong book position for the first half of 2017, which includes double-digit pricing growth, while not including any benefit from our China ship, which doesn't launch until July of 2017. Consequently, our view regarding our $5 adjusted earnings per share target for 2017 has not changed since last quarter and we look forward to posting double-digit adjusted ROIC at the end of this year for the first time in our company's history and leading the industry in this all important metrics. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Yes, thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Thank you and good morning. Frank, I just wanted to stay with that last point you made on the $5, because as you think there might be some confusion, I believe in your last release, you have talked about exceeding the $5 and then in this release it seems more like you were on track for the $5, so perhaps you could help explain the difference and some metrics there? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. Look, there is no difference. I just reiterated our position. We feel as strong today as we ever had, perhaps stronger than ever, given that we are now closer to 2017 than we were one quarter ago. And as I said it earlier, bookings, which is the main driver of this business remains strong for 2017, pricing is very strong, double-digit yield growth. So, we've never talked about exceeding the $5 target, while we set $5, but the point I want to get across is nothing has changed. If we were going to exceed it, we're going to exceed it today as much as we were last quarter. And no one should read a whole lot into the change of words that we use whether it was reach or some other word to qualify it. 2017 is looking very, very good and I'm very comfortable with where we are. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I just wanted to touch on the well-known softness in Europe, now coming from North American, kind of a two-parted here. One is, when you think about or if you are looking back in terms of what it's happened so far, can you just parse out for us how the low end demand from North Americans from Mediterranean cruises have affected the Norwegian brands versus the Prestige brands? And then also I was just hoping you could touch upon a comment that you made that over the past few weeks, these things are worst, is behind us and that you're seeing some improvement? Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. I won't talk about the different brands individually. A third of our overall business approximately for European itineraries is sourced in Europe. So, we still rely primarily on the North American consumer. And while we are trying to diversify our channels, as you know over the last year, we've opened offices in Sydney, Australia in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in Germany, in China, we're still a Northern American centric company, and that's good, because the North Americans paid the highest amounts to go onboard cruises and spend the most money once they are there. But you have to recognize that given the events that have occurred in Europe over the last four months or five months, in multiple situation, it affects the North Americans more so than the local markets in Europe. But, yes, as time and distances from the events, people tend to forget what happened. We put the past behind us, and we look forward. And so, yes, I have seen what I believe is the worst of the downturn in North American market demand for European sailings behind us and have seen an uptick in business in the last four weeks. And we hope that momentum continues. And if it does, we'll see upside to our projection. Felicia Hendrix : Great. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Frank J. Del Rio : But it's important to note, Felicia, that we don't need a major rebound in European business to hit our target. We have seen that the business will continue to \u2013 it has been and therefore we have reaffirmed our guidance for the full-year, if Europe materially improves then we can see some upside. Felicia Hendrix : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is open. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Great. Thanks. I think your last comments on 2017 were very interesting, double-digit pricing growth, and if you could kind of give some color on bookings, and why do you think it is so strong for \u2013 is it first half of 2017, is that what you said, I don't remember for the full-year or first half? Frank J. Del Rio : First half, because the second half is still lightly \u2013 so lightly booked that is not material to commentary. Look, our brands are strong, our marketing platforms are resonating in the marketplace. As we have repeatedly said, other than European itineraries, business is stronger than ever, Caribbean is very, very strong, Hawaii, Bermuda. Q1 of 2017 has very little Europe as you know is primarily a Caribbean-centric quarter. And as we, again, distance ourselves from the events of Europe, by Q2 of 2017, things begin to improve. And remember that Norwegian Joy, the new China vessel doesn't come on till Q3. So, the fact that we are, so well booked at such high pricing without the benefit of the China vessel, which we all know is higher yielding than the rest of the fleet is very encouraging for us. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Great. And do you think that the improved traction in bookings for the \u2013 I believe it's North American passengers going to Europe, which has been the big source of weakness, is that just because memories are kind of fading of kind of the incidents in Brussels and Paris and they're getting more comfortable with traveling to Europe versus maybe promotions and discounts, which I think everyone's been doing for a while now, but it seems to be resonating, according to your comments. Frank J. Del Rio : Well, there's a couple of things. One is, yes, those events are not hitting our customers in the face every day in the news cycle. It's a bit of history, nothing new has happened and let's \u2013 hopefully, we keep it that way. But another factor is, because overall travel through Europe is down, the airlines have also had to drop prices. And so, our customers are gaining the advantage of that lower price, so it's more economical for them to travel to Europe. So, that's having an impact as well. The strong dollar helps as well. So, we're hopeful again that the worst is behind us and we've got some green shoots that indicate that, the worst is behind us. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley: Hi. Great. A couple of things, want to clarify. One is, can you give us the breakdown of Europe or maybe even Eastern Med, specifically Q3 versus Q2? Just trying to think about, given the impact that that's Q2, and trying to think about what that might be in Q3? I know you're not giving specific guidance for that in Q3, but just kind of thinking about the percent of exposure? And then, also, just looking at Q1 results of the gross yield. I know there are different sort of deferred revenue adjustments and we can't tell it's sort of with or without currency for that, but I guess how to think about the gross yield change in Q1, I think kind of flattish and like I said, maybe there are adjustments to make there? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. I'll take the \u2013 your question about the Eastern Med and so forth. Our Q2 capacity in the overall Med is 21% and the growth of 26% in Q3. So, it's more, but not so materially more. But we are well booked in Q3. And again, our guidance for the full-year takes the consideration what has happened in Europe in Q2, what impact it had in our Q3 Europe business. And in spite of that weakness, we reaffirm our full-year guidance, which suggest that if Europe hadn't had the difficulties that it's having, our results would have been even stronger, but we do feel confident that in spite of what's happening in Europe and without the need for Europe to have a major rebound as I noted earlier, we are confident of our current guidance. Robin M. Farley: Good. That's helpful. So, your current guidance, you're assuming that the declines in the Med in Q3 would be at least as much as the declines in Q2, right? You're not looking for any improvement, you're saying our guidance fully assumes yields will be down as much in Q3 as they were in Q2, in the Med specifically? Frank J. Del Rio : The difference between Q2, Q3 when you talk about Europe in general is that the Baltic which is a very high yielding itinerary and it has been less impacted than the Mediterranean has really comes into focus much more in Q3 than in Q2. In our case, the Baltic represents almost a three-fold increase in capacity over Q2 in the Baltic. Robin M. Farley: Okay. Now, that's helpful. And on the Q1 gross yields? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. Wendy A. Beck: Yeah. So, I think what's really important to keep in mind here is that as we have rolled out our bundled packages, which actually started in Q1 of 2015, the accounting rules stipulate that the revenue is allocated between the ticket and the onboard revenue based on retail value. So as a result, the individual components are not representative of the selling price in the market. So, what I would focus everybody to concentrate and I have been saying this quarter-after-after, is look at total net yield, or total net revenue. And so, if you look at that \u2013 if you just take it on a component basis and try and divide it out by capacity days it looks skewed, when you look at \u2013 when you pull apart ticket and onboard, but it's totally as a result of these bundled packages. And then, once we get into Q2, we'll be rolling over like-for-like, when you look at Q2 of the prior-year, before rolling out the bundled packages. Robin M. Farley: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. And just one final thing, Frank, I don't know, if I \u2013 and you comment on the 2017 volume on the books or just first half of 2017, volume on the books? Frank J. Del Rio : First half, yes. Robin M. Farley: Is the volume up as well as price? Frank J. Del Rio : It's comparable to the prior-year. And as you know, we started the year in a great book position, so I'm very happy of where we are for 2017. To be more booked, quite frankly, we'd probably be leaving money on the table in terms of yield. And I much more prefer at this stage, to be up double-digit in pricing then have another point or two in capacity. Robin M. Farley: Great. Perfect. Thank you very much. That's great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Your line is open. Harry C. Curtis: Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the second half of this year. Can you provide us with a little bit more visibility on how well booked you are in the second half? How much more is there really to sell? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. Hi, Harry. So, the per diems are up in the mid to high single-digit with occupancy slightly down and slightly down in primarily in Q3 because of the Europe situation we've been discussing. So, I rather be slightly ahead, but not anything significant that we can't overcome, I'd rather much have the up in pricing, because there is so difficult, Harry, to claw back pricing than it is to claw back occupancy. Occupancy is for after that ship sails and comes back again, but that pricing tenure that you have in the marketplace lingers. And so, we're very, very pleased and proud of what we've been able to achieve on the pricing side, all our three brands are recognizing the industry is having the highest yield in their respective categories, and I want to protect that at all cost, so to speak. And the good news for us is that, the tempo of bookings is strong, it is strong, very strong in the fourth quarter, it is very strong in 2017, we know about the slight weakness in the third quarter. But it's been offset again by Explorer being so well booked, just about sold out, it's not sold out in the entire second half. Sirena, a very high yielding ship is also very well booked. And then there is a 40-day charter that it is at a premium pricing. So, as we mentioned in the call, approximately half of our second half yield growth is looked in. Harry C. Curtis: I understand. Thank you for that. And let me shift gears. If you could touch on or follow-up on your comments in the last call with regard to Cuba, it's little bit later getting the approval from the government than you thought, give us your thoughts on that. And one of your competitors commented that they thought the impact of Cuba would be relatively modest, do you feel differently? Frank J. Del Rio : I am still confident that a Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings vessel will cruise to queue up before year-end. We continue to make progress on both, happy of where we are and disappointed that I missed your April deadline, but I am getting closer. And again, feel very, very strong that we will have all this wrapped up soon and that one of our vessels will cruise into Cuba first of the year. Look, I still believe that Cuba will garner a yield premium to anything else in the Caribbean. The question is going to be what percentage of any brands or any company's overall capacity will be dedicated to Cuba, and how many sailings will that ship operate in Cuba. Obviously for a company like us that were smaller than our two other competitors in the space, a Cuba or a ship like China that could represent a much bigger impact than it does for others. As you know, Norwegian Joy one vessel in China represents 8% of our capacity. And so, I don't want to say I disagree with where we make that statement; but on a relative term, I think Cuba will likely be more significant for us and it maybe for the other two because of pure size. Harry C. Curtis: Thanks, Frank. Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Harry. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Milota of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kevin M. Milota: Hey, good morning, everyone. I was hoping, if you could give us a sense for what you think the Explorer or Sirena in the Getaway charter will add to core net yield growth of 2% to 3% in the second half? Frank J. Del Rio : I don't have that number a couple of my head to give you, but I'll tell you that, that business is baked in, the charter is a contract that baked in, Sirena and Explorer both very high yielding vessels are much more so than the rest of the fleet and that's what gives us the confidence that we are going to be able to achieve our yield in the second half of the year. Like I said earlier, it's roughly half of our projected yields growth in the second half of the year are baked in because of our already strong book position, I remember, I said that our currently book position is up mid to high single-digits in the second half for of the year along with those three items. Wendy A. Beck: So, I would just add Kevin that our implied yields are very strong for the back half of the year, approximately 4.5%, but we've also given the cadence that Q3 will be stronger. We don't actually break it out by the brands, but significant strength is coming from those three items, we cited. Kevin M. Milota: Okay. Very good. And then second, could you give a sense for what the total percent of your business has been booked for the third quarter and fourth quarter? Frank J. Del Rio : We typically don't breakout occupancies like that specifically. I will tell you that the back half of the year, the second half of the year, pricing is up mid to high single-digit with overall occupancy compared to this time last year slightly down or the slightly down is all in Q3, because Q4 is slightly up. Kevin M. Milota: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim A. Conder: Thank you. Just a follow-on, Frank, on a couple of questions that have been asked. And by the way thank you for all the color you've given so far, greatly helpful. The Prestige brands, given that they booked further out, did you see cancellations post Brussels on those and is that what really is impacting Q2 more so and then not as much Q3 because of the SKU into the Baltic? And then going forward here with the changes that you've made or you're attracting more Europeans to fill even though you don't source that many Europeans. Just a little more color on the dynamic with Q2, Q3 in Europe? And then, if you cloud also, anything you can give us on the type of premium that Getaway charter is achieving for those 40 days, 45 days that you mentioned? Frank J. Del Rio : No, by contract, we can't talk about that charter, it is at a premium to what you ordinarily would generate actually operator or normalized itineraries. But getting back to your first question, about cancellations both Brussels, typically when these kind of events happened, cancellations is not what causes the weakness. If you're booked, you tend to stay. What typically happens is new bookings are harder to come by. And that's what happened after Paris, it's what happened after the Istanbul situation in early January and it's what happened after Brussels. And so, it takes a little bit of time for the new cycle and Brussels as you recall was a heavy new cycle and lingered on for a while. So, it's not behind us, and bookings are begun to come back \u2013 it's also primetime, Europe is, this is one people start going to Europe. And so it is possible, although we're not counting on it from the point of view of our guidance that there will be a late Europe booking season, later than normal to bridge the gap from where we are today versus where we normally are. Tim A. Conder: Okay. And then Wendy or whoever want to take these if I may, couple of just maybe a little one nuance colors here. China, what percent of your capacity overall, you'd mentioned that Joy will be 8% of capacity, given that's coming midyear. If you only say roughly 4%, will China represent your 2017 capacity, and then on a fully annualized basis? And then Wendy on the hedging, historically all of your hedging has been as you'd said concentrated in that 3% sulfur type of grade. How should we think about the mix now you're hedging with the MGO now starting to \u2013 your EBITDA qualify that for hedge accounting? Frank J. Del Rio : So, in terms of your question on China. Yes, it will be roughly 4% for 2017, because it should come midyear; on a run rate basis based on current capacity, it is 8%. Tim A. Conder: Okay. Wendy A. Beck: And Tim, from a mix standpoint, nothing has changed. So, roughly 70% HFO, 30% MGO, but we're using brands as a property for hedging for MGO. Tim A. Conder: Okay. Great. Thank you both. Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Tim. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. I wanted to circle back on fuel. When you look at the guidance of the fuel price per ton and then also consumption it looks like there is kind of a nickel benefit versus when you last gave guidance, but you've also mentioned some other items that are impacting earnings. So, could you just help us with the math on what the net EPS impact of fuel is versus when you last gave guidance? Wendy A. Beck: Fair. Hi, Vince. So, full-year is down about $13 million at the time that we gave our original guidance, our hedge position was roughly 75%, meaning 25% of consumption was subject to volatility. So, we spent pretty much locked at and being 92% hedged. I'm sorry \u2013 and what was \u2013 did I answer that or do have another question? Vince Ciepiel : No, I was just wondering, if your updated full-year guidance, if fuel has been a headwind or tailwind or a neutral to that? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Your call will resume momentarily. Okay. The call will resume now. Frank J. Del Rio : Sorry about that. We don't know what happened. Is everybody back on? Operator : Yes. Vince, are you still there? Vince Ciepiel : I'm here. Operator : Okay. Frank J. Del Rio : Vince, can you repeat your question or do you have a new one? Vince Ciepiel : Yeah. So, on fuel, I was just wondering if moves since the last time you've provided guidance were neutral, a headwind or a tailwind to the full-year EPS guidance? Frank J. Del Rio : Vince? Vince Ciepiel : Yeah. Frank J. Del Rio : Okay. We couldn't hear you. Can you repeat that? We're having a little technical difficulty here. Vince Ciepiel : Sure. I was just wondering if the moves in fuel since you initially provided the full-year EPS guidance have been a headwind, tailwind, or roughly neutral to the updated guidance? Frank J. Del Rio : Okay. Wendy A. Beck: Yeah. So, the updated guidance, Vince, is actually a tailwind for us. So, we've locked it in, it's $13 million to $14 million on a full-year basis that we'll benefit from. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thank you. And then secondly on China. I had written down that it was about a $15 million cost investment in 2016, $15 million in the first half of 2017, and then turning profitable in the second half of 2017, so much so that it should be accretive and additive to the $5 target. And I was just curious if I had that correct? And if anything has changed since the last call that suggests that's no longer the case? Wendy A. Beck: No, you have that correct. So, it's $15 million in 2016, I would straight line that throughout 2016. And then 2017, first half, there is an additional $15 million of cost. And although that would be a run rate of $30 million for the year, we really just call attention to the fact that the ship isn't there in the first half and it is there in the second half. But even with those costs in 2017, it still \u2013 run rate is profitable in 2017 and that is accretive to our $5 EPS target. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. James Hardiman : Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just a couple mechanical questions on the first quarter. Obviously, the first quarter yields were significantly better than you would had expected, costs were also better. So, presumably that other income line that you talked about was worse. How should we model that throughout the remainder of the year, is there an offset in other income later on or should that be a similar negative for the year as what we saw in the first quarter? And then secondly, it looks like you got a pretty nice benefit from occupancy in the first quarter about a 140 basis points better than last year, help us understand that were just more families taking trips or was there something more structural that allowed you to do that, that might be a benefit going forward? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. In terms of the Q1 occupancy, there is a strong quarter. We had Escape for the first time, we didn't have Escape Q1 of 2015. She's very popular, it's the peak winter Caribbean season. The marketing has resonated very well. We rolled out the Feel Free At Sea promotion. And the vast majority of the inventory was out of Europe and already booked at the turn of the year. Remember, we had a very, very strong book position at the end of the year, which benefited Q1 more than any other quarter, just because of its proximity. Wendy A. Beck: But then just kind of rolling down through Q1, yield as we called the attention to, we have seen much greater strength in the Caribbean. We also saw increased onboard revenue, so you get the right passengers on there, they tend to spend more as we've called attention to. So, we definitely got a boost to our yield. Net cruise cost, some of that is timing, primarily on marketing. On the other income, you can't really model that. So, this is the first time that we've called attention to this mark-to-market on our ATS or advance ticket sales. The advance ticket sales is a liability for the fact that these are future sailings and due to the weakening of the dollar at quarter end, we recorded this, but if rates hold at these levels, it would provide a similar tailwind in the future quarters. So, you book that revenue then as the ship sails, if you will. And, again, we've never really called us on the past, because it was immaterial. So, I don't think from that standpoint, you can really model it, but we will call attention to it in future quarters. Frank J. Del Rio : What was a headwind in Q1 will turn into a tailwind in future quarters for the reasons that Wendy just said. Wendy A. Beck: And I think that's why it's important I called attention to it with the fact that it's $0.02 added on to $0.38 if it wasn't for this mark-to-market, we really delivered $0.40 EPS. James Hardiman : Just so I understand that, the benefit that you'll get will be on the yield side rather than on the other income line? Wendy A. Beck: That's correct. As long as the ship hasn't sailed, your mark-to-market whatever in your liability in ATS, but then once it sails, it's actually in yield. James Hardiman : Got it. And then, my last question, while we're talking about currency, it seems like the currency headwind for the year is essentially unchanged versus your prior guidance, which is a little bit of a surprise, given at least what I'm looking at the euro or the Canadian dollar and the British pound all strengthened versus three months ago, maybe that just wasn't enough, but why aren't we seeing a little bit of a benefit on that front? Frank J. Del Rio : Well, primarily, we source 85% of our business from North America. And therefore 85%, 86% of our business comes in U.S. dollars. So, it's not material, number one; number two, the currency hasn't changed that much. Wendy A. Beck: Right. We're rolling over similar levels from the prior-year. James Hardiman : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Wendy A. Beck: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio : Maybe it's time for one more question. Operator : Yes, sir. The last question will come from Dan McKenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Dan J. McKenzie: Oh, hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I wonder if you can remind us what percent of the Mediterranean capacity is tied to luxury versus contemporary cruise in the second quarter? And then, I guess, just related to that, given what you're seeing, is there a need to perhaps increase or expand distribution in Europe looking ahead? Frank J. Del Rio : Well, we are working to diversify our outsourcing, so that we are not still dependent upon the North American market. It's one of the pillars of the FDR deal that we rollout last year. So, since last year, we opened sales offices in Sydney, Australia. We've opened up three offices in China. We opened an office in Brazil, and we've added resources to both our German offices to take care of Continental Europe and our UK office in Southampton as the UK is our single largest non-North American market. So, that takes time, but we're already seeing an increase in business from these non-North American markets. It's one of the reasons why we feel pretty good about Q3, we'll be able to source more business out of Europe, primarily for the Europe itineraries, although we have to recognize that those likely will come in at a lower price point, because that's just how the European business is. But we do have \u2013 we are \u2013 booked so well at such high prices for Q3 that we can absorb that. And we don't \u2013 I'll take the first part of your question, as we won't breakout the capacity by brand. But overall, our Mediterranean capacity, I think I mentioned earlier in the call, is 26% in Q3 versus 21% in Q2, and only 15% in Q4. For the full-year, it's 17%. Dan J. McKenzie: Okay. Understood. Appreciate that. And I guess, Wendy, with respect to deferred revenue tied to the latitudes program, have any of the accounting assumptions changed around that in terms of the amount of the ticket price that you might defer into future periods? And then I guess, just tied to that, when do the points expire exactly before it becomes recognized as actual revenue? Wendy A. Beck: Okay. So, when you're saying latitudes program, first off the, advance ticket sales is what are your latitudes number or not. It's all revenue that it deferred, that's on the book. But are you referring to the crude mix program? We are actually booking our crudes in advance. Dan J. McKenzie: Yeah. Just in terms of the year on credits for the \u2013 with respect to the latitudes program. Wendy A. Beck: Yeah. So, that's just when they're redeemed. Dan J. McKenzie: Understood. Okay. And do they... Wendy A. Beck: like 12 months then it expires. Dan J. McKenzie: I see. Okay. Very good. That'll do it for me. Thanks, guys. Wendy A. Beck: Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio : Well, thanks everyone, for your time and support this morning. And as always, we are all available to answer your questions throughout the day. Have a great day. Thanks, everyone. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. As a reminder, to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow to discuss results for the quarter, as well as provide guidance for the third quarter and full year 2016 before turning the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. We will then open the call for your question. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2016 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. I would also like to review information about forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial information as a part of this call. The company's comments today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations. The company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you would like more information on the risks involved in forward-looking statements, please see the company's SEC filings. In addition, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the company's earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning everyone. Wendy and I have a good amount of material we would like to go over, so we will dive directly into our commentary on second quarter results and our revised expectations. The second quarter marks yet another quarter of healthy earnings having achieved year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. That continues our track record of delivering strong financial performance. Earnings for the quarter have had several puts and takes, which Wendy will go into more detail later in the call. The second quarter and the month following saw a series of news grabbing geopolitical events that when combined with other operational considerations result in a revision to our earnings expectations for the back half of 2016 and into 2017. This revision includes our expectations for $5 adjusted earnings per share in 2017, which given current conditions we have withdrawn and instead replaced with an achievable annual earnings per share growth target of 15% to 25% over 2016 adjusted earnings per share. The reasons for our revision can be attributed to four primary drivers : a challenging operating environment in Europe, the impact of weaker foreign currencies, a sharp increase in Miami-based Caribbean capacity, and our decision to maintain pricing discipline consistent with our go-to-market strategy. The main drag to our earnings expectation has been the rapid and steep deterioration of the operating environment in Europe and the negative impact that successive incidences and geopolitical events have had on cruise demand for the region, especially from our core North American consumers. Three fundamental factors coalesced to cause this deterioration. First is the sheer number of incidences and the magnitude of the events themselves that have taken place primarily across Europe in the last several months. Just prior to last quarter's call, the world was coming off the attacks in Brussels, which led to a slowdown in bookings in the immediate aftermath. By the time of our first quarter call in early May, we had begun to seek modest booking traction over the prior four weeks following the Brussels attack, which caused us to be hopeful that the momentum would continue. The guidance we provided at the time assumed no upside from an improved European booking environment whose slowdown we believe was behind us. Unfortunately, the opposite happened and the faint traction we had seen following Brussels quickly collapsed by the occurrence of further events, fulminating with the attack at the Istanbul airport and only deteriorated further with the Bastille Day tragedy in Nice and the failed military coup in Turkey. This pattern of fits and starts where bookings would begin to gain some traction only to be quickly stalled by the occurrence of another headline event has been characteristic of the overall operating environment in the past several months. Along with the occurrence of these adverse events, our current passenger sourcing mix has also played a role in the weak performance of our European itineraries. While our international marketing initiatives continue to gradually increase our sourcing from local European market, the fact is that today we source the majority of our guests from North America. For instance, our highest yielding ships in the region historically source approximately 70% of their guests from North America. These guests are also some of the most risk adverse and their demographic is such that the majority are not bound by work or school schedules; meaning, they can delay their vacation to another time of the year if they do not feel safe traveling to a particular region. This drop off in North American demand added pressure to rely more heavily on sourcing from local European markets, which comes at a lower ticket price and lower on-board spend. In the second quarter, all brands sourced more passages from Europe than in the prior year. The last factor contributing to the different difficult operating environment in Europe is our 7% year-over-year capacity increase and our overall heavy deployment to the region, which spans from the beginning of the second quarter to the middle of the fourth quarter across all three brands. Europe has historically been the strongest performing destination during the peak Q2 through mid-Q4 cruising season; and as such, we deploy the majority of our vessels there. This year, half of our fleet is dedicated to operating Europe itineraries during this six-month to seven-month season and particularly during the entire and all-important third quarter. It is important to note that of these 12 ships, eight are the highest yielding in our fleet and include our two latest additions, the Oceania Sirena and the Regent Explorer. To put this ship deployment into perspective, the percentage of brand capacity in the region is approximately 28% for Norwegian brand, 87% for the Oceania brand and 81% for Regent. And while the Baltic region has performed to expectations, the additions of Oceania Sirena and Regent Explorer resulted in a 32% increase in Mediterranean capacity for these two brands combined adding additional pressure to the rest of our fleet in the region. Adding to the capacity pressure was a narrowing of our itinerary offerings as a result of our previously announced suspension of calls to Turkish ports across our three brands in 2016 and into 2017. While it is difficult to find a silver lining in this challenging European operating environment, we believe that we have now fully factored the total impact of how the region is currently performing into our outlook, which we believe removes significant uncertainty for the remainder of the year. The second key driver of our revised 2016 expectation is the impact of a stronger dollar or conversely weaker global currencies, particularly those in Europe as a result of the Brexit vote in the UK earlier this year. The next major driver to our 2016 revised guidance is our Caribbean deployment, particularly out of my Miami. While the strong fundamentals in the region remain intact, and I want to repeat that, the strong fundamentals in the region do remain intact, the high year-over-year expectations that we place on the region to deliver strong pricing growth despite a steep capacity increase did not fully materialize. As a company, our capacity growth in this market is 37%, 28% and 10% in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, which outstrips that of the industry in each of these quarters by a wide margin. The major catalyst for this capacity growth is the deployment of two of our largest and newest ships, Norwegian Getaway and Norwegian Escape in Miami for the low season month of April through October. This doubling of capacity during the lowest yielding period in the Caribbean resulted in pricing that while higher than prior year was less robust than our high expectations. And while a 40-day charter of the Norwegian Getaway helped alleviate some of the pricing pressure, there was still a good portion of the period which was accessible to the impact of this significant capacity increase. For 2017, we have remedied this deployment concentration by shifting the Norwegian Getaway to the higher-yielding Baltic region for the peak season beginning in mid-Q2; a region which has historically outperformed the Caribbean in any operating environment. Oceania Cruises has a similar capacity profile in Q4 2016 and Q1 of 2017, when it's two largest ships are both operating from Miami to the Caribbean region for the first time. For fourth quarter 2017 and first quarter 2018, this capacity concentration has also been remedied with a redeployment of Oceania Marina to Tahiti and South Pacific itineraries. The last major driver to our revised expectations come from our continued commitment to our core go-to-market strategy of maintaining pricing discipline by minimizing discounting and instead focus on increasing value. The deal versus price. In normal operating environment, this strategy results in optimized yields. And why we have generally adhered to this strategy throughout this challenging period, the expected outcome is slightly lower occupancies resulting in lower on-board revenue which combined generate lower net yield than originally anticipated. Our adherence to the strategy during a challenging operating environment demonstrates our commitment to operating this company for long-term success. Substantially abandoning this strategy could result in a few more points of yield and therefore revenue. However, it would come at a high cost of eroding hard-fought long-term pricing gains which are infinitely more difficult to regain than they are to lose and which would have a larger negative impact in future quarters. To summarize, our prior expectations for 2016 have been pared back due to four main factors : the challenging operating member for European itineraries, the weakening of global currencies, our steep capacity increase in Miami-based Caribbean itineraries and our commitment to maintain pricing discipline. As a result of these factors, we have revised our earnings expectations and anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.45, a healthy 18% increase at the midpoint of guidance versus prior year. Our confidence in these projections take into account that our current book position for 2016 is 96%. Looking to 2017, we have extrapolated the impacts of the current operating environment into next year. The result is a tempering of earnings expectations, which will fall short of our previously stated $5 in adjusted earnings per share. Nevertheless, in continuing our string of delivering strong year-over-year performance, we anticipate that adjusted earnings per share will grow in the range of 15% to 25% in 2017 as current booked position for next year shows first half pricing up mid-single-digits on comparable occupancy levels. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy to go into our results and earnings expectations in more detail. Wendy? Wendy A. Beck: Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2016 and 2015 per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis and includes the results of our land-based operations in Hawaii, which were excluded in our guidance. I'll begin with commentary on our second quarter results followed by a color on booking trends and finish with an update on our full-year 2016 guidance. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.85, coming in at the top end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.85. Softness in top-line results versus our expectation was partially offset with a reduction in costs. Many of the factors that Frank mentioned in his commentary led to lower than expected yield growth in the second quarter, particularly the impact from the challenging operating environment in Europe and our capacity increase in the Caribbean. These headwinds resulted in adjusted net yield growth coming in below our expectations with adjusted net yield growth on a constant currency basis up 1.2% or 0.8% on an as-reported basis. Excluding our land-based operations in Hawaii, adjusted net yield growth was up 1.3% or 0.9% on an as-reported basis. Looking at cost, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day, increased 4% or 4.1% on an as-reported basis, well below guidance of 6.25% or 6% on an as-reported basis. Excluding our land-based operation in Hawaii, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day was up 4.2% or up 4.1% on an as-reported basis. Favorability to guidance was mainly due to lower general and administrative expenses primarily related to a reduction to management incentives, cost savings associated with food costs and a reduction in dry-dock expenses due to efficiencies with our Norwegian Edge program as well as timing of certain marketing expenses. Turning to fuel; our feel expense per metric ton net of hedges decreased 15.9% to $469 from $558 in the prior year. At face value, fuel expense net appears to be favorable versus guidance for the quarter. However, when combined with a $3.2 million realized loss recorded in other expense related to a portion of our fuel hedge portfolio which was deemed ineffective, our all-in fuel expense was essentially flat to guidance. Taking a look below the line, interest expense net increased to $68.4 million compared to $52.4 million in the prior year mainly due to an increase in average debt balances outstanding, primarily associated with the delivery of Norwegian Escape in October 2015 and higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR rates. The increase also reflects a write-off of $11.4 million of deferred financing fees related to the refinancing of certain of our credit facilities. As for other income (expense), there are a few puts and takes impacting this line item. First was the aforementioned loss due to ineffectiveness of our fuel derivatives of $3.2 million. Second was a loss of $9.4 million from the fair value decrease related to a foreign exchange collar for the Seven Seas Explorer newbuild, which we customarily adjust out of earnings. These losses were partially offset by a gain in foreign currency. Looking ahead, let's take a look at our markets and deployment around the world for the third quarter. On a consolidated basis, approximately 22% of our deployment mix is in the Caribbean compared to 19% for the prior year due to the addition of Norwegian Escape to our fleet. This higher mix of Caribbean itineraries results in a roughly 28% capacity increase in the market, which is less than the second quarter due to the full ship charter of Norwegian Getaway for 40 days in the period. Europe accounts for 36% of our deployment mix for the third quarter. The addition of Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Cruises' Sirena to the fleet increased capacity in Europe for these brands combined by 32%, which is a steep increase in capacity for these brands to absorb in a market that has proven to be more challenging than anticipated. As for other key markets, Alaska accounts for 16%, Bermuda 12% and Hawaii 5% of our deployment mix, all of which are performing in line with our expectations. Now I'd like to walk you through our guidance and expectations for the third quarter and full year 2016. As a reminder, due to the pending sale of our land-based operation in Hawaii, all guidance and sensitivities exclude the results of this operation for both current and prior year. In addition, for your reference in our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, we provided key metrics for 2015 by quarter and full year excluding these results to assist with modeling on a like-for-like basis. Let's start by bridging the change to our adjusted EPS guidance from the time of our last call. $0.34 is attributable to lower revenue, of which approximately 70% of the decrease is due to the aforementioned impact on sailings in Europe; 20% is due to the tempering of our revenue expectations for the Caribbean, which still remains a solid market with year-over-year pricing up mid-single digits; and the balance due to other itineraries, mainly South America, which has been impacted by headline events in the region and repositioning in other sailings. $0.12 is due to the impacts of foreign exchange combined with increased fuel prices. These reductions were partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses, which include management incentives along with cost-reduction initiatives and operating expenses which account for $0.11. Now turning to guidance for the third quarter. Adjusted net yield is expected to be up approximately 2.5% or up approximately 1.75% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be up approximately 1.75% or approximately 1.5% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.62 for the quarter, a double-digit increase over prior year. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $510 with expected consumption of approximately 170,000 metric tons. Our guidance now includes a new level of detail for our fuel hedge portfolio to provide additional transparency for this line item. We've included a table in our earnings release, which provides a breakdown of our hedged fuel consumption based on our two main fuel types : heavy fuel oil, or HFO; and marine gas oil, or MGO. We provide the percentage of our HFO consumption that's hedged and the average price per barrel based on Gulf Coast 3%, which is the proxy we use to hedge this fuel type. We've also provided the percentage of our MGO consumption that's hedged along with the average price per barrel of Brent, which is the proxy used to hedge this fuel type. Guidance for full year 2016 is as follows. Adjusted net yield is now expected to increase approximately 1.75% or 1% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is now expected to be up approximately 1.25% or approximately 1% on an as-reported basis. As a result, adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. While we will provide guidance for the fourth quarter on the next call, I'd like to provide some color on the quarter. Q4 will encompass a 46% increase in capacity for European itineraries for Oceania Cruises; an increase in Caribbean capacity due to the absorption of the two largest ships in the Oceania Cruises fleet, which will both be sailing in the Miami-based Caribbean region; and a significant capacity increase for the Oceania Cruises brand in South American itineraries, where we have experienced some softness. Also, keep in mind, we're rolling over a record high yield performance for the fourth quarter of 2015, where we posted growth of 7.4%. With that, I'll turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss a couple of updates that I would be remiss not to cover with you. First is the milestone for the Regent brand with the much anticipated delivery of Seven Seas Explorer. This is the first ship for the brand in some 13 years and she undoubtedly lives up to her reputation as the most luxurious cruise ship ever built. Seven Seas Explorer has brought not only a new standard of luxury to cruising, but also a new level of pricing that is impressive even by the high standards already set by the Regent Seven Seas' brand. Turning to the Norwegian brand, less than a year from now, the line will introduce its first purpose-built premium ship for China; a market with the means to reach and even exceed the size of those in North America and Europe. The advent of cruising in China gives the industry a third core market to allocate inventory, which did not even exist just 10 years ago. In the fourth quarter of last year, we announced our intention to enter the Chinese market. And shortly after finalizing itineraries, we immediately engaged with the top charter travel agents in China to begin the education and sales process. At this point, in the selling cycle, we are well along in allocating our available inventory among our top travel partners; and the early results are very encouraging. To-date, we have allocated the vast majority of our 2017 inventory for Shanghai sailings and almost all of that for our six Beijing departures. While these are only allocations and not yet hard contracts, the strong interest exhibited by the travel agent community for Norwegian Joy has been exceptional. The allocation selection period is followed by negotiations that lead to signed contracts; and I'm happy to report that not only have we closed on our first set of charter contracts for Shanghai sailings, but that these contracts closed at prices that meet our internal targets. The signing of these contracts coupled with strong indications of interest in the allocation process and an entry into the market at a time where capacity increases have begun to moderate after years of rampant growth gives us continued confidence in our China deployment strategy and reaffirms our expectations that China will be accretive to 2017 yields and earnings and will be a source of positive ROIC growth. We are looking forward to bringing the Norwegian's brands distinctive product offering in the market's first premium purpose-built ship to the Chinese cruising public and believe that the development of this market will provide strong financial benefits for years to come. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question is from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open. Harry C. Curtis: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Frank, with respect to 2017 guidance range of up 15% to 25%, can you give us a sense of what you're building in for yield growth or what the range of yield growth might look like for both Europe and the Caribbean? And then embedded in that up 15% to 25%, where does China fit into that? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. Good morning, Harry. As you can imagine, today is not a happy day here at Norwegian headquarters for the obvious reasons, but we did believe that the circumstances were such that we had to reset expectations to take into account current booking environment. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourself and provide you yield guidance of the implied 2017 except to tell you that it is moderate. We believe we have taken into full account the environment that we're in. And so, the 2017 projections by definition have the effect of the flow-through and have the effect of more tempered expectations into the future. In terms of China, as my commentary just said, we continue to feel very good about China. Things are progressing well. The interest is high. Our pricing is fair. The way we've decided to engage with the travel agent community there is slightly different than the norm and is being well accepted. And so, our view on China has not changed; and, therefore, whatever variable was part of the prior guidance remains intact for China. Harry C. Curtis: But \u2013 I'm still trying to understand is, is it baked into the up 15% to 25% or would there be upside? Frank J. Del Rio : No. No, it's baked into the 15% to 25%. Harry C. Curtis: It is. Okay. That's good. Okay. And then just turning to the Caribbean, we heard from Royal that the Caribbean actually looks like it should be reasonably strong in the fourth quarter, but the implied yield for Norwegian is essentially flat for the fourth quarter. Can you talk about the puts and takes in the fourth quarter and where you're seeing the most pricing pressure? Frank J. Del Rio : The whole story on Caribbean for us is not one of market weakness, per se. Year-over-year, our ships are outperforming where they were this time last year. It's a recognition that the high expectations we had just aren't being met; and we believe that that is almost exclusively due to the heavy concentration of inventory in the weak period. And that's why we had previously announced that Norwegian Getaway was moving out of Miami and into the Baltic to take some of this pressure off of this key four-month or five-month period from mid-Q2 through very early Q4. Wendy A. Beck: And the other thing that I would just state is although for Q4 our Europe capacity is only 15%, it is skewed. So in October, we've got 32% of our capacity in Europe; still a significant amount there. And we've already called out the fact that we're going to have two of the large Oceania ships in the Caribbean. So, once they come out of Europe, we're absorbing the capacity in the Caribbean. Harry C. Curtis: Okay. So is it fair to say then that still with the capacity that you have in Europe that we're still seeing double-digit declines in European pricing in the fourth quarter? Wendy A. Beck: Yes. That is fair to say. And then the other thing I would just call attention to, again, is we're rolling over very strong numbers from the prior year at 7.4% yield growth. Harry C. Curtis: Okay. That does it for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Thanks a lot. Just to kind of stay on that line of discussion. So when we think about the fourth quarter, I just wanted to be clear, what is the bigger drag on the fourth quarter? Is it your European deployment or is it the Caribbean? Wendy A. Beck: Yeah, it's both. It's a couple of items there. So it's the Caribbean capacity adds, it's the European weakness; and then also we've called out that we're seeing some softness in our South American itineraries also that moderates our numbers for Q4. And again, as I just mentioned, 32% of our capacity in October is still in Europe. Felicia Hendrix : Right. Thank you for that. And then just to be clear, so the discussion that you're having about the Caribbean in your Miami-based ship, it sounds to me that \u2013 and this is why I'd like to see if I'm interpreting this correctly \u2013 it sounds to me that you were just too optimistic regarding your performance there versus you seeing any kind of change in the Caribbean. So what I'm trying to get at, is the Caribbean as a market overall performing any different than what you expected previously? Frank J. Del Rio : No. I think you pretty much are clear on that. The Caribbean is performing strong. Year-over-year, it's better than it was this time last year. Our expectations were outsized and they didn't materialize. Wendy A. Beck: So we recognize, Felicia, that we've got two of the \u2013 it's our two newest Norwegian ships, large ships side-by-side when most folks in the cruise industry move their assets to more premium itineraries; and our two ships were left here during the softer Caribbean sailing. So, again, we've fixed that for next year. But, unfortunately, it ended up being weaker for the two ships during the softer months. But, overall, we're seeing strength in the Caribbean. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. And that \u2013 okay, so you say that's fine, you say that was up mid-single-digits. And are you seeing that same kind of growth as you look out to the first quarter in the Caribbean? Frank J. Del Rio : Yes. First quarter looks very, very strong. We're ahead in both price and load, as I said earlier. That statement holds true even for the first half. We're ahead in mid to high-single digits in pricing and slightly up on load. If you focus just on Q1, the load is even higher than just low-single-digits and the pricing is even stronger than mid-single-digits. So Q1, I think, under-highlights the strong overall product line of the NCLH brands because it's the quarter that has the least amount of Europe. Europe is the main driver of what's causing the downward revisions; and Q1 has very, very little Europe in it. Felicia Hendrix : Thanks. And last one for me, I just want to clear the air on this. With the challenges that you're having and the commentary you made in the release about your Miami-based cruises, are you seeing any impact from the recent Zika headlines? Frank J. Del Rio : The short answer is no, we're not seeing any evidence. But the reality is that the only evidence that we can actually get our hands around and quantify if there was one would be cancellations; and there has not been any uptick in cancellations. The unknown is always how many bookings would've taken place that haven't taken place because someone was concerned about Zika. Every event is either going to be a positive, a negative or a neutral. I think we can all agree that no one would dare make an argument that Zika is a positive. It's difficult to make an argument that's even neutral. So the question is if it's a negative, how bad a negative is it? And for that, I don't know, I can't quantify it. Our business remains strong. Our occupancies are in line with prior years. And our NPD's are up. Hopefully, this situation will be contained. Hopefully, it will not spread and the news outlets will stop covering it as much as they've had, at least here in South Florida. But it is having an effect, I believe, in our South American itineraries, as Wendy commented on. We do have quite a bit of capacity down there; and the situation there is more acute than it may be here in South Florida. And so, we are seeing softness in South America and we're having to do more of what we do in the marketplace to stimulate demand for folks to go there. Felicia Hendrix : Thanks for the clarity. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Steven Wieczynski : Hey. Good morning, guys. So if I can go back to 2017 and kind of re-ask the question in terms of implied guidance there, you say 15% to 25%, I understand you don't want to give what the yield number is going to look like. But is there a better way to kind of think about how you think about individual markets, meaning \u2013 and I guess what I'm trying to get at is do you think that Europe next year, the way you guys are thinking about it, are you assuming Europe is going to be down again in 2017? Wendy A. Beck: We are assuming that it will be similar environment to what we're riding through this year. So obviously the unknown is how will Europe shape up. So we assumed conservatively that we'd be riding through similar circumstances to how 2016 has shaped up. No rebound or clawback is built into the numbers. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. So when you look at that 15% to 25%, it's almost, I don't want to say worst case scenario, but is that a fair way to say it? Wendy A. Beck: I don't know that we'd say worse case. Frank J. Del Rio : Look, I think we recognize the degree of the restatement here. And so, we wanted to be straight down the middle what's our best guess based on what we're seeing today with a touch or a dose, if you will, of conservatism got to be on the safe side. But I don't want you to think that we're sandbagging numbers here. Because we're not. We think that the European environment is challenging. We're hopeful that it turns, and it will turn sooner or later. But given the magnitude and the number of events that have shaped the environment today, it is difficult to be very optimistic that things will turn around. Usually, when events would occur, they would be isolated. We saw the pattern repeat itself time after time. There would be a period of time when bookings would slow, cancellations would not tick up to any consequence. And after a few weeks when it was no longer a headline news, people would forget and we'd get back to normal and the healing process would commence. There's been no healing process in this environment because it's one after the other after the other after the other. When will it stop? Anyone's guess. We're assuming that whatever environment we have today continues into the booking period into 2017. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And then second question. Frank, you talked about China and gave a pretty good overview there. With your 2018 Breakaway Plus ship, how do you view that in terms of where that's going to be allocated? I know one of the markets you have talked about would be taking that to China. Is that still pretty realistic at this point? Frank J. Del Rio : No. No, Steve, we never \u2013 that I recall \u2013 we never mentioned or never discussed that the 2018 vessel would go to China. The 2018 vessel will go primarily to non-Caribbean North American itineraries. Basically, the same deployment that the Norwegian Joy was going to undertake before we decided to send Joy to China. It's the 2019 Breakaway Plus vessel that could go to China if we see that there is room for another vessel there. Steven Wieczynski : And when will that decision be made? Frank J. Del Rio : By the end of the year. As you know, 2019 vessel comes out in Q4 of 2019. And we have to give direction to the shipyard as to which version of a Breakaway Plus vessel to build; a version for the Western market or a version for the Chinese market. Steven Wieczynski : And then last question, real quick. Frank, with the stock at obviously sub-$40 today, can you give us an idea of where you guys view buybacks at this point? Wendy A. Beck: Sure. Hi, Steve. So at this time, we are remaining consistent with the fact that we want to continue to de-lever to that 4 times leverage; and we plan to be repurchasing shares shortly thereafter. Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. But we'll remain opportunistic. We'll remain vigilant. But we don't think that what we believe to be a short-term drop in the stock price ought to change our view of what to do with our free cash flow. Steven Wieczynski : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, you said first half pricing was up mid-single digits. Can you just give us the number if you strip out Explorer and Sirena? Because I would imagine those two ships are skewing it upwards since they're booked much further out at generally pretty nice premiums. Is that right? Wendy A. Beck: Yes. Hi. Good morning. It does. So we are getting pricing premiums with those ships, in particular the Explorer. Jared Shojaian : Okay. So if you were to strip those out, are you still booked at higher prices going forward? Wendy A. Beck: Yes, we are. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just lastly, I'm a little surprised by the magnitude of the cut for the second half of the year just considering how much was already booked; and now you're saying moderate yield growth for 2017 despite the sharp drop out here. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile your comments to the 15% to 25% earnings growth next year reflecting the current environment. So what gives you confidence that 2017 yield can still grow moderately in the midst of everything that's going on right now? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio : Well, look, we're taking into consideration the sluggishness that we're seeing in the European marketplace, primarily from our core North American consumer, and are projecting a very modest yield profile for those bookings to be made in 2017. The main driver of yield growth in 2017 will not be Europe. It'll be other destinations, which we have said remains strong; Alaska, Hawaii, Bermuda remains strong. The Caribbean remains strong on a year-over-year basis, just short of our high expectations. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley: Great. Thanks. Just trying to quantify the magnitude of the change here. It seems like given that you're guiding to yields down in Q4 and the implication of your EPS change in 2017, is your guidance for European pricing down in the sort of 20% to 30% range? Because if we just think about what kind of yield change it would take to take $1 off of your earnings next year, it seems like a lot of that's coming from Europe. But that would imply something in that 20% to 30% decline range. Frank J. Del Rio : No. I think that's several times too much. We do expect European 2017 yields to drop from where they are in 2016, but not to that magnitude. But we really don't want to get into yield growth by region, by quarter, at this time. We will provide full guidance as we normally would during our Q4 commentary that will take place in early February. Wendy A. Beck: And, Robin, I would add that we've seen strength in our other markets this year \u2013 Alaska, Bermuda, Hawaii, we've told you guys that \u2013 somewhere in the magnitude of high-single-digits up, but our European itineraries were high-single-digits down. So we've assumed a similar type environment where we'll see nice growth in other markets, ex-Europe, more moderate pricing in Europe as we go into 2017. Robin M. Farley: Okay. And then maybe also just a clarification on 2016. You mentioned the capacity increase in the Caribbean as being kind of the reason that maybe things weren't as strong as you had thought. And I guess what does that tell us about new ship premiums in 2016 with the Escape in there, would've thought that would've been a driver of premium yield, not a contributor to sort of too much supply making pricing tougher. So I guess what can we conclude about pricing on the new ships or the new ship premiums for 2016? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. The whole issue, at least with us, is we had lost the expectation. So we want to reiterate that the actual performance of our vessels in the Caribbean, even with having more capacity there than we probably should, at least in the low season, is up year-over-year. We just thought it was going to be higher. And so, prior to the situation that evolved in Europe, we decided that it was best to move Getaway out and put her, as we said, in the Baltic because the Baltic has a nice short season, roughly four months; and in every possible environment that we've ever seen, easily outperforms the Caribbean during the same time period. But you've got to remember that in 2016, the capacity days for NCLH in the Caribbean was up some 15%, whereas it was down low-single digits for our competitors. In 2017, things reversed themselves. Perhaps a bit of a contrarian view, where NCLH's capacity in the Caribbean drops by 4.5%, while our two main competitors grow mid-single digits. So we think we've taken the risk out of the Caribbean also by rebalancing the deployment of our vessels on a seasonally-adjusted basis out of the weak Caribbean and into the high-yielding Baltic. Robin M. Farley: And maybe just a final clarification. With the Caribbean pricing up, but not up as much as you had thought, is that more due to new ship performance or sort of the same ship performance or a little bit of both? Frank J. Del Rio : Getaway is the only vessel that was there for two periods that you can compare year-over-year. In the prior year, she was doing Eastern Caribbean itineraries, which are typically higher yielding than the Western Caribbean that she's now doing. So on a pure year-over-year basis, not taking into consideration the itineraries, Getaway was slightly down. Escape, however, is higher in the Eastern Caribbean itineraries that she took over for Getaway. And so, you can make certain implications there that the Getaway drop is not so much Getaway itself, but because she was redeployed to the lower-yielding Western Caribbean. Robin M. Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim A. Conder: Thank you. Can you hear me? Frank J. Del Rio : Yes. We can, Tim. How are you doing? Tim A. Conder: Okay. Fine. And my apologies. I'm on the road here, Frank. Just if you could give a little more color regarding your forward bookings over the next 12 months, just maybe globally and pricing. I think you alluded to it out through second quarter, but just wanted to make sure that that was a global basis. And then just again to maybe refresh Caribbean and Europe, whether you want to say first half 2017 or however you want to frame it? Frank J. Del Rio : Yeah. Look, in Q4, load factors are about flat year-over-year as are NPDs, roughly flat, slightly down. 72% of the inventory is already booked for Q4, so there is still 30% of the inventory to book. We're seeing better pricing over the last four weeks or five weeks, so we think that that NPD has a chance of recovering a little bit. In terms of 2017, as I mentioned earlier, Q1 looks very, very strong; looks very, very strong both in load and in pricing compared to the same period last year. As you sneak into Q2, the load factor isn't as strong as Q1. We're, in essence, down slightly, down very low-single-digits in load; and in pricing, we're up. So for the first six months of 2017, the period of time where we have some level of significant bookings, pricing is up mid- to high-single-digits and load factor is just about flat. So, against those expectations, remember, we're comparing a revised, more conservative outlook for 2017 compared to where we were this time last year when we were bullish. So the fact that we're even with last year, a year where at this point in time we didn't know about all these bad things that were going to happen that affected the marketplace as it has, I think, is a good thing. Because the built-in expectations for performance are a lot less for 2017 than they were this time last year for 2016, even though 2017 is performing on par with 2016 in terms of load and up on pricing. Now there's still a lot of bookings to be made before Q1 and Q2 are over. But at least at this early point, we feel very good about Q1, primarily because there's very little Europe in Q1. I feel less confident about Q2. But because of what we've baked into Q2 and Q3, et cetera, for next year, in full recognition of the weakness that Europe is displaying today, we can make the statement that we make that our EPS growth next year ought to be in the 15% to 25% range above what we did this year. Tim A. Conder: Okay. So again, based on Europe kind of as is and then just to clarify again on the Caribbean, the real issue again, you upped your projections, you felt you were too optimistic. And with the Getaway and Escape both being there simultaneously and you feel that that should self-correct to a degree and then you see, you'd view it more as a issue, more concentrated to your cells rather than an industry pervasive issue. Is that a fair way to characterize it? Frank J. Del Rio : Yes. That's correct, Tim, because I don't see it as an issue in our other markets. We believe it's a seasonal situation. For example, on the positive side for the Caribbean, some time ago we decided to take Epic out of Europe in the winter and relocate her to Port Canaveral in the winter months; and she's doing fabulous. Load factor is up double-digits and NPDs are up double-digits for Epic versus where she was deployed in prior periods in Europe. It's part of the finding the right balance of where to put your ship so you can generate the highest yield, the highest returns and it's a moving target. You have to \u2013 the good thing about ships, they have propellers, they have rudders and you can move things around depending on how you see things developing. At one time, we thought that the Miami market was strong enough to handle two of our vessels; we now believe that we can generate better returns for ourselves if we move one of them seasonally to the highest yielding European itinerary, which is the Baltic. Tim A. Conder: Okay. And lastly, if \u2013 when does the window, I guess, for insiders or the company open up if you did want to do some modest share repurchase here at this time? Is there a period after you release earnings here? Wendy A. Beck: Yeah. So it's within 48 hours. So on Thursday it opens. Tim A. Conder: Okay, great. Thank you. Wendy A. Beck: Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio : Stephanie, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Your line is open. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Great. Thanks. My questions are just related to the behavior of North American passengers booking in Europe, let's say, for near-term sailings versus sailings in second, third quarter of next year. Are they less unwilling to book far out in advance? Is it more of a near-term where they're concerned about the near-term, but maybe they think things are going to clear up and the bookings are a little bit stronger for next year for North American passengers? Frank J. Del Rio : I haven't yet seen the North American customer make that call. It's a bit early, Greg. The peak booking window for North Americans to go to Europe is late Q3, certainly Q4. So a little bit early. But the point we'd like to emphasize is that we're not counting on it. We're assuming that the same set of factors that we see today continue well into the future; and, therefore, the 2017 numbers are what they're shaping out to be. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Okay. And then also, I don't know if you mentioned it on the call, but typically it's about two-thirds of your passengers for European sailings are sourced from North America, a third from Europe. When do you expect that mix to be closer to a 50-50? Frank J. Del Rio : It takes time, unless you want to just buy the business; and one of the things we don't want to do is to drop prices unnaturally. While we are hopeful that this European environment changes, we don't anticipate that it's going to change overnight. It will take some time to repair, assuming that there are no additional incidences to reopen the wound, so to speak. But remember that Europeans tend to book lower cabin categories. You tend to have to price the product lower to them; and then once on board, they spend a lot less on board. And so, unless you think what we have here is a permanent shift, where North Americans will not want to go to Europe to the degree that they are accustomed to \u2013 and I don't believe that for a moment, I believe this is a temporary situation, I just don't know how temporary it is \u2013 then you don't want to have that skewness. Remember, we don't have European-centric brands like our competitors do. And so, when you compare different sourcing mixes, you've got to take that in consideration. Gregory Robert Badishkanian : Okay. Good. Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio : Thank you, Greg. Frank J. Del Rio : Well, thanks, everyone, for your time and support. As always, we will be available throughout the day to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on this post-election Wednesday. Please allow me to take you back some 50 years to 1966. Lyndon B Johnson was President, and the United States and the Soviet Union were in the thick of the Cold War. Star Trek premiered on CBS, and Caesar's Palace had just opened on the Las Vegas strip. The Department of Transportation was founded, and an actor named Ronald Reagan became the unlikely Governor of California. A little spooky this morning, but that's what happened. It was a year that shaped our country in terms of politics and pop culture. It was also a time when Americans were fully reaping the benefits of the post-war boom, and one of their main aspirations was to see the world. This same year, a small ship made its maiden voyage from the port of Miami to the Bahamas. These weekly-scheduled voyages ushered in a sea change in the way Americans and later the world would view holidays at sea. The MS Sunward carried just 550 passengers, pioneers, really, in a new type of vacation, one where you pack once, embark and disembark the ship in the same city, and in between, experience a world very different from your own. Compared to today's cruise industry, the accommodations were spartan, the service was barely passable, and the food was better known for its quantity rather than its quality. Yet the unique experiences afforded by this new approach to vacations kept guests coming back for more. Norwegian Cruise Line, back then known as Norwegian Caribbean Line, was the company that offered this unique new vacation experience, and throughout its first 50 years, it has never stopped innovating. Most of you on this call know many of Norwegian's innovations and industry firsts from developing the industry's first private island experience in 1977 to launching the first 2000-plus passenger ship in the Caribbean, and from pioneering service to Alaska from Seattle to bringing back American flag cruising in Hawaii. But perhaps the biggest innovation aside from pioneering the modern cruise industry vacation was the introduction of freestyle cruising. Norwegian took one of the last vestiges of the old ocean liner experience, that of nightly assigned seating in a single venue, and introduced in its stead a dining offering more typical of a resort vacation. The line offered a variety of dining venues on every vessel, allowing guests to choose to dine when they want, where they want, and with whom they want. Today, Norwegian's unique capability at delivering this product offering is unrivaled in the industry and is the primary choice for guests looking for a less structured cruise vacation. Today, Norwegian Cruise Line holdings has grown with the addition of sister brands Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, solidifying its standing as the world's third largest cruise operator. Despite its size, the company punches far above its weight. Since its initial public offering in 2013, NCLH has generated double-digit annual adjusted earnings growth per share, a trend expected to continue in 2016 and 2017, and grew its return on invested capital to approach double-digits. The company also continually posts strong revenue growth and outsized net income per berth. Along with a history of strong financial results, our three brands also have a long history of industry accolades. Most recently, the editors of Cruise Critic awarded Norwegian Cruise Line the Best Cruise Line for Entertainment, Oceania Cruises the Best Line for Dining, and Regent Seven Seas received two nods, one for best suites and another for Seven Seas Explorer as the Best New Luxury Ship. As an aside, Seven Seas Explorer has been extremely well received, with her popularity extending beyond an incredibly strong inaugural year in 2016 where bookings and pricing set brand records. In the inaugural Town & Country Magazine's travel issue Cruise Awards, Norwegian Cruise Line was voted Best Overall and Best Food for Mainstream Line, Oceania Cruises was voted Best for Food, On-Shore Excursions, Regent Seven Seas won for Best Suites. These are just a few of the numerous awards our brands have garnered over the last few months alone. These impressive industry awards, along with our strong financial performance, would not have been possible without the contributions of so many incredible people over the past 50 years. To our loyal guests, offering you an incredible vacation experience at a terrific value is at the core of everything we do, and we thank you for your continued patronage over the years. To our travel agent partners, you are the ones that bring our wonderful ships to life long before our guests set foot aboard. The importance of your contributions to Norwegian are undeniable, and we deeply appreciate your support throughout the last five decades. To our shore side employees, you have witnessed this company grow and develop into a world-class organization, and as a result of your many contributions, we are as successful as we are today. And lastly, to our shipboard staff and crew. To many of our guests, the main draw of a Norwegian, Oceania or Regent cruise isn't the innovative hardware, the gourmet cuisine, the top-notch entertainment, nor the exotic destinations visited. It's you. It's the smiles that you conjure, the exceptional service that you provide, and the passion that you demonstrate that breathes life into our ships. You are the heart and soul of this company, and on behalf of everyone that has ever sailed, worked or represented our three wonderful brands, I offer you our sincerest thanks. To mark the 50th birthday of Norwegian Cruise Lines, we invite all current and past guests, travel partners, employees and crew to post their memories on Norwegiansfirst50.com or to post their favorite social media outlet using the #Norwegiansfirst50. Norwegian Cruise Lines' 50th Anniversary marks a significant milestone not just for our company but for the modern cruise industry. It is an industry that I have been actively involved in for nearly 25 years, and it is extremely gratifying to have been a small part of its development. Cruise vacations continue to provide an unrivaled vacation experience at an amazing value, and the industry as a whole has done an incredible job of bringing this winning combination to millions of guests around the world. What began as a Florida-centric offering aboard small ships has grown into a global industry which, as large as it is, remains underpenetrated and ripe for continued growth in mature, developing and emerging markets. One of these developing markets is destined to become one of if not the largest cruise market in the coming years. A nascent market just 10 years ago, China today has grown at a rapid pace to become the second largest source country and the world's fastest growing cruise market. The cruise industry's expansion in China has many similarities to how the cruise industry developed in the United States, and while the growth in China market has been impressive, it is still in its very early stages of development. We look forward to actively participating in the growth and expansion of this important market and we do so beginning next summer with the launch of Norwegian Joy, the first and largest purpose-built ship for Chinese consumer. The vessel maintains many of the hallmarks of the Norwegian brand, a variety of dining venues, top notch entertainment and innovative onboard activities and combines them with features customized for Chinese guests, including larger connecting family state rooms and the largest shopping complex in Norwegian's fleet, carrying an impressive list of global, luxury, and lifestyle brands. We have received tremendously positive feedback on Norwegian Joy's offerings, both directly from our travel Partners in China as well as indirectly with Norwegian receiving the Most Anticipated Brand award at this year's annual CCYIA Trade Conference in Tianjin. Norwegian Joy's unique offerings, customized for Chinese guests is resonating extremely well with travel partners, and thus far we are very pleased with the pace of signed charter contracts and its related pricing. And while China represents an important opportunity for our company, it is not the only market where we are diversifying our International footprint. We have several initiatives underway to drive more customers from all over the world to our brands. While we continue to expand our sourcing efforts in Europe, we are also focused on developing our infrastructure and sourcing from other markets including Australia and in Asia outside of the China. We've made great progress in Australia and New Zealand where sourcing for the Norwegian brand alone has increased approximately 20% in 2016. This region is important for us because it boasts one of the lowest customer acquisition costs across our brands and is among the highest net ticket prices with guests eager to book more premium itineraries such as Europe and Hawaii. This expansion of sourcing in Australia and New Zealand will also benefit our Asia Pacific deployment where Norwegian Star begins her first season in the region in the next few weeks and our return to Sydney and Auckland sailings in 2018 aboard Norwegian Jewel. To also bolster our presence in the region, we have recently opened sales offices in Tokyo, New Delhi, Mumbai and Singapore to help accelerate development of these emerging markets for all three brands. Looking to today, our financial performance for the third quarter marks the highest single quarter revenue and earnings in our company's history. The addition of Norwegian Escape, Oceania Sirena and Seven Seas Explorer contributed to revenue reaching $1.5 billion, and growth and adjusted earnings per share of 20%. To put this performance in perspective, adjusted earnings per share for the first 9 months of 2016 were $2.85, which is just $0.03 shy of the $2.88 we generated for all of 2015, our previous record year. For full-year 2016, while our Mediterranean season was softer than anticipated mainly due to the external geopolitical events, performance was strong in our other main markets such as Alaska, Baltic, Hawaii and Caribbean. As a result, we expect to deliver strong adjusted earnings per share growth for this year. In 2017, we begin to leverage the benefits of our deployment optimization initiatives. These initiatives include the return of Norwegian Epic to sail in the Caribbean in the first quarter where she is significantly outperforming her prior year deployment out of Barcelona, and redeploying Norwegian Getaway in the late second and third quarters from non-beach (13:47) Caribbean itineraries to the premium Baltic region. As of today, first half of 2017 booked business show both pricing and load ahead of this time last year. As we look to the second half of 2017, please keep in mind that at this time last year, pricing on the books was reflective of strong demand for Med sailings that were taking place at the time and which were prior to the negative impact from the successive geopolitical events that rocked the region beginning in mid-November of 2015 through mid-July of 2016. Therefore, when comparing year-over-year position, it is not a like-for-like comparison until we lap the effects of these negative events later in our booking cycle. As a result, second half of 2017 is currently showing flat occupancies with lower pricing year-over-year. That said, recent booking volumes have been encouraging particularly for the all important Mediterranean region where we have seen positive trends over the last 8-week period from our top yielding North American source markets across all three brands. Looking at the year as a whole, and taking the aforementioned impacts from geopolitical events into account, and excluding Norwegian Joy, 2017 is showing commensurate occupancies with absolutely lower pricing. While directionally, our underlying fundamentals remain in line with prior expectation, what has tempered our earnings outlook somewhat are the adverse effects of foreign exchange and fuel prices that have arisen since the last time we spoke, both of which are beyond our control. It is important to note that excluding these fluctuations, we expect to deliver solid double-digit growth in 2017 adjusted earnings per share. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy to go over our results and earning expectations in more detail. Wendy. Please? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares to 2016 and 2015 per capacity day metrics on a constant-currency basis and includes the results of our land-based operations in Hawaii, which were excluded from our third quarter guidance. I'll begin with commentary on our third quarter results followed by color on booking trends and an update on fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 guidance, finishing with an early look at 2017. Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.62, coming in at the top end of our guidance range of $1.57 to $1.62. Adjusted Net Yield growth increased 3.4%, or 2.8% on an as reported basis mainly due to higher pricing versus prior year. Looking at cost, Adjusted Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day increased 1.7% on both a constant currency and as reported basis mainly due to an increase in marketing expenses. Turning to fuel, our fuel expense per metric ton net of hedges decreased 11.5% to $500 from $565 in the prior year. When combined with the $2.5 million realized loss recorded in other expense related to a portion of our fuel hedge portfolio which was deemed ineffective, our all-in fuel expense came in slightly higher than guidance. Taking a look below the line, interest expense net increased to $60.7 million compared to $49.8 million in the prior year, mainly due to an increase in average debt balances outstanding primarily associated with the delivery of Norwegian Escape and Seven Seas Explorer as well as higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR rates. Other expense was $5.3 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily related to unrealized and realized losses on fuel swap derivatives and foreign exchange derivative hedge contracts as well as foreign currency transaction losses. Turning to markets and deployment for the fourth quarter on a consolidated basis, our deployment mix in the Caribbean is approximately 47% which includes capacity growth of 10% due to a partial quarter of Norwegian Escape along with increased capacity for both Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas cruises in the region. This market tends to be the most promotional in fourth quarter and is performing in line with our expectations with pricing up mid-single digits and occupancy down slightly when compared to same time last year. Turning to Europe where pricing has remained soft year-over-year, the region accounts for 15% of our deployment mix for the fourth quarter. This deployment includes a 46% increase in capacity for Oceania which was disproportionately impacted by the challenging environment during the seasonally low period. The balance of our deployment is a mix of itineraries, all of which are in line with expectations with the exception of South America, which continues to experience softness. Before walking you through guidance and expectations for fourth quarter and full year 2016, I'd like to discuss the sale of our Hawaii land-based operation. As this transaction has experienced delays in the required regulatory approval process, we no longer expect the sale to close in 2016. As such, we have moved away from excluding the results from this operation in our guidance. Including our Hawaii land operations in guidance results in a slight lowering of Net Yield and a slight increase in Net Cruise Cost resulting in no impact to earnings per share. For the fourth quarter, capacity will increase approximately 10%, mainly due to the full-year of operation of Norwegian Escape, as well as the addition of Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Cruises' Sirena to the fleet midway through the year. Turning to Adjusted Net Yield, we anticipate a decrease of approximately 2.25% or 2.75% on an as reported basis as a result of three key factors. First, we are rolling over extremely strong Yield growth of 7.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. Second is the aforementioned challenging environment in Europe, where pricing is down mid-single digits, and occupancy down slightly versus same time last year. Lastly is South America, a market in which we have a significant capacity increase of 36% with continued softness. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day is expected to be down approximately 2% on both a Constant Currency and as reported basis. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $453, with expected consumption of approximately 182,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.57. As for the full-year, Adjusted Net Yield is expected to increase approximately 1.75% or 1% on an as reported basis. Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel Per Capacity Day is expected to be up approximately 1.25% on both a Constant Currency and as reported basis. As a result, Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.38 to $3.42. Taking a look at our deployment mix for 2017, we are pleased with the optimization of our slate of itineraries for next year. The Caribbean will make up 37% of our deployment mix, with capacity in the region decreasing by mid-single digits primarily due to the shift of Norwegian Getaway to the Baltic region during the peak summer season. Meanwhile Europe, which will experience a capacity increase of approximately 10%, will comprise 23% of our deployment mix. This is again primarily due to the aforementioned shift of Norwegian Getaway to the Baltic region, where we expect her to garner higher pricing compared to sailings in the Caribbean during the non-peak summer season where she sailed this past year. Our Asia, Africa and Pacific deployment mix increases from 3% to 8%, primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Joy to the Chinese market, as well as the shift of Norwegian Star to itinerary sailing in Asia and Australia, which are marketed primarily to Western consumers. As for other markets, Alaska remains at 7% of mix, Bermuda remains at 6% of mix, Hawaii increases slightly to 5% of mix, and the balance is in other itineraries. As we look to 2017, there are a few items I'd like to discuss. First, we will have a like number of dry-docks versus 2016, with five of the eight occurring in the first quarter. Second, we will be up against tougher comps in the third quarter, as we lapped a premium priced 40-day charter of Norwegian Getaway in that period. Third, we are lapping the introduction of Seven Seas Explorer, which entered the fleet in a premium market at peak summer season after experiencing record early bookings at the higher prices typically expected in an inaugural season. 2017 marks Explorer's first full-year of operation, resulting in a normalization of pricing that takes into account both peak and non-peak seasons. Finally, as Frank mentioned in his commentary, last year at this time, the effects from geopolitical events in Europe that impacted 2016 had yet to materialize. Therefore, current comparisons are against a stronger booked position in both occupancy and pricing. While these factors were included in the preliminary earnings range we provided last quarter, since that time, significant fluctuations in the fuel and currency markets have impacted these initial indications. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the British pound, as well as the sharp increase in fuel prices resulted in headwinds versus our prior expectation. As a result of these headwinds, both of which are out of our control, we anticipate delivering double-digit growth in Adjusted EPS in 2017. As we customarily do, we will provide more detailed guidance for the coming year in our fourth-quarter earnings release. With that, I'll turn over the call to Frank for some closing comments. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Wendy. Next week the cruise industry's newest port of call, Harvest Caye, will open for guests sailing Western Caribbean voyages. Located off the southern coast of Belize, this tropical destination is unique in the industry offering visitors the option of experiencing a 5-star resort-style beach getaway or exciting eco-friendly excursions on the mainland. The responsible environmentally sensitive development of this island has been a priority for Norwegian since day one. Its privileged location near the world's second largest barrier reef meant that an even higher level of care and planning was necessary to complete the final product. And what a product it is, this unique and unparalleled eco-oriented destination immerses guests in the flora, fauna and culture of Belize through its nature center, extensive green areas, and shops run by local Belizean artisans. We look forward to her debut next week as the premier destination in the Western Caribbean. And from the warm waters of Southern Belize we turn our attention to the Pacific Northwest, where Norwegian recently revealed plans for its upcoming 2018 new build, the Norwegian Bliss. As the pioneer of cruising to Alaska from Seattle, it was only fitting that Norwegian returned to the Emerald City to debut its first ship to enter service directly into an Alaska deployment. Details regarding the ship's features will be revealed over the coming months but one recent partnership we are happy to announce is with Wyland, the world-renowned wildlife artist who Norwegian commissioned to design the hall art for Norwegian Bliss. His design, \"Cruising with the Whales\", depicts the majesty and diversity of the waters of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. The importance of protecting Alaska's delicate ecosystem is paramount, which is why Norwegian Bliss will not only be our first ship to debut in Alaska, it will also be the first to debut in the market with exhaust gas scrubbers, which reduce emissions of sulfur into the air by up to 99%. The attention paid to environmental concerns in the development of Harvest Caye and the deployment of scrubber fitted Norwegian Bliss demonstrates Norwegian's continued commitment to protecting the oceans and the destinations in which we sail. As part of our continued commitment to green systems and technology, Norwegian Jewel, Norwegian Pearl and Norwegian Gem were each successfully retrofitted this year with new closed loop exhaust gas scrubber systems similar to Norwegian Bliss, which will significantly reduce air emissions thus reducing our fleet's environmental footprint. These are just a couple of the examples of our overall sustainability efforts of which I look forward to sharing more details with you in the future. Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to once again thank everyone who contributed to the success of Norwegian's first 50 years, and to also thank those working on the numerous exciting initiatives that are already contributing to a strong start to our next 50. From our upcoming debut in China, to our newest island destination, to our flagship in Alaska, these initiatives are positioned us to continue delivering strong growth in revenue, return on invested capital, and earnings well into the future. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first question has a few parts. First part is clarification because, Frank, at the end of your initial prepared remarks, you said that excluding the fluctuations and factors you can't control like FX and fuel, EPS guidance is up double digits but the way it was written in the release and then how Wendy described it, it sounded like it was not excluding. So, I just wanted to get some understanding on how to look at that 2017 outlook. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Look, we don't want to go a whole lot into 2017 expectations. That's what Q1 is all about. What we're saying is, since we last spoke, two items, FX and fuel have gone against us. And if those trends continue, those are headwinds to our previously stated 2017 expectation. So we just want to alert you that those items are real. They've occurred; they are occurring; they are beyond our control. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: But they're included in hitting double-digits. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Correct. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. EPS guidance is up double digits, including the effect of fuel and FX. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Correct. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, Wendy, can you help us understand kind of what the incremental fuel FX headwind is since the last time you gave us color on 2017? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. So, for 2017, it looks like it's somewhere in the range presently of $0.10 to $0.15. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And that's $0.10 to $0.15 incremental from August? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: That's correct. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And also on your last call you said that yield growth would be moderate. Has that changed? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yield growth, we're not going to give you guidance, but yes, it will be moderate, and it would also be positive. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Those are my questions. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. I want to clarify also in the 2017 outlook and the release you talked about occupancy sort of commensurate with prices slightly lower for the full-year 2017, but I think, Frank, in your comments, it sounded like you said excluding the Joy, which is going to China, that was the case commensurate with lower price excluding Joy. So I just want to clarify whether that's the case in both situations, and how Joy would change that 2017 outlook? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi, Robin. Yes, the statements excluded Joy. As you know, the charter model in China is very different than what we are accustomed to here. So, in all the numbers that we have provided you, the effects of Joy are excluded. We are continuing to be very bullish on China. Everything that we've seen thus far continues to confirm our expectations that China will be accretive, that China's pricing as we see by the charter contracts we have under our belt thus far are consistent with our prior statement of expecting pricing up some 20% over the Norwegian fleet average. And in terms of 2017, yeah, loads right now are flat to slightly higher than they were this time last year. But it's very important to understand, and Wendy mentioned that in her prepared remarks, if you recall the series of events that really hurt the business last year, particularly in the Med, began just about now a year ago \u2013 November 13, if my memory serves right. And, so especially, when it has to do with pricing, the pricing that we have on the books today a year ago and how we ended were very different. Remember, a year ago today, we still believed that we were aiming for a much higher 2017 earnings per share that the Med primarily caused us to ultimately take down. So you have to understand that when you're looking at the business today versus a year ago, you have to take into consideration those series of events that damaged the business going forward. So not until we have an opportunity to lap this period are they really comparable. It's not so much on load, because load is load. It's more on pricing. So we're very pleased where we stand on load, especially for the first half of the year. We're okay with where we stand for load for the full-year. Our first half pricing is very strong. It's where the second half, which is primarily driven by heavy concentration of Mediterranean cruising, where this year-over-year comparison has got to be carefully analyzed, because you're comparing two very different periods. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then just one other clarification on 2017 EPS. Should we be thinking about double-digit growth as being around 10%, and if that's the case, from the midpoint of the previous guidance, I thought 15% to 25%. It's about, call it, a $0.20 or $0.30 reduction in EPS outlook for next year. And Wendy, I know you said FX and fuel combined are kind of negative $0.10 to $0.15 of that. Would you say the other piece is more -- you've mentioned opening a number of international marketing offices. Is it more that, or is it more sort of cautiousness on the yield side that -- thinking about that change since the last call? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. I think you answered my question for me, or at least you tried. So let me clarify. Look, we still are very well positioned for 2017, like we were last time we spoke. In fact, if anything, we're better positioned in some ways. Certainly first half. We're not going to provide a whole lot more guidance on 2017. I don't even want to use the word guidance. It's more of an indication. It's next quarter when we provide more clear guidance, but 2017 will greatly depend on the Mediterranean. It is by far the highest yielding itineraries across the board today. Again, if you compare where we are on pricing for second half to where we were this time last year, it's a negative. But this time last year didn't sustain. Pricing eroded and eroded significantly because of all the events that occurred which resulted in what we're going to generate in terms of earnings per share this year, which, by the way, is a record for the company, but lower than what we expected. Look, double-digit is a broad statement, and I'm not necessarily walking away from our prior comment, but I just think at this juncture, still very early vis-\u00e0-vis 2017. We ought to leave it at that. I will point out as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that business from North American source consumers, especially for Mediterranean sailing for 2017, have been up significantly. Double-digits. Strong double-digits across all three brands in the last 8 weeks to 10 weeks. And we would expect that given that we have not had any major geopolitical events occur since mid-July. That healing process that we always talk about has finally taken hold, and business has begun to come back as we would expect. So if this trend continues, we will soon begin to lap prior year weakness, as the prior year began to take the effects of the geopolitical events that hopefully we won't have this year. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the sequential pricing weakness in the third quarter this year and the fourth quarter in the Med to get a better sense in Europe of what the comp actually is. Can you give us \u2013 or what would be very helpful is if we could understand how weak the pricing was, how much did it fall in the third and fourth quarters in the Med this year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: That's a complicated question to answer, Harry, with any great detail. But, what I would point you to is at this time last year, the company still believed that we could deliver our original earnings per share growth, and in spite of tight cost controls, the reason we had to take our earnings guidance down for both 2016 and 2017 was because of the significant yield deterioration that we saw, primarily in Mediterranean sailing. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And we did say on the last call that Europe was anticipated to be \u2013 or that what we were seeing was down high-single digits. And that did prove out, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And then, Wendy, can you remind us what your fuel hedge, the pricing of your fuel hedge and the percentage for next year? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, so we are 79%. We gave a lot of color in the press release, Harry, but we're 79% on average. It's broke out between HFO, 81% at a price just under $60 per barrel. And then for MGO, we are 75% hedged on Brent, and it's about $41 a barrel. And I would also add regarding fuel, we have about a 90% correlation to our hedges to the price we actually pay at the pump. So that puts us about a fourth of our fuel bill in 2017 that's actually subject to market fluctuations. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And my last question, just has to go, is related to the supply growth. Just overall, do you think that the growth in your capacity, which has been stronger than your competitors, do you think it's just outstripping your ability or your marketing systems to fill that capacity growth? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No, I don't think so. Let's take ship by ship, Escape is performing very, very well in the Caribbean, for 2017, is performing extremely well. Especially in the second quarter and third quarters, when we have moved Getaway to Baltic, which is also performing extremely well compared to what her performance had been in the Caribbean. In terms of Explore, the Regent Explore, she had just a gangbuster record-setting year in 2016 in both loads and yields, setting brand records. And as we look at 2017, that vessel is also continuing the same trends that we saw in 2016. In fact, her pricing is up over 2016 even though she's going to be operating a full-year as opposed to in 2016, her inaugural season, where she came in midyear which is the high season. Sirena, the Oceania vessel that came in April of 2016, is probably the one that performed the least well, and that's primarily because the Oceania brand had five of her six ships in Europe, three of her six ships in the Mediterranean in 2016. So it's a little bit of bad luck that we put a vessel for the Oceania brand in the market that took the brunt of the geopolitical events. The good news going forward is that neither Oceania nor Regent have any new capacity coming online until 2020. At the Norwegian brand the new capacity in 2017 is going to China, and I gave you commentary in China. We're very pleased with how China is coming along. And so, Norwegian won't have any new capacity for the Western market until 2018 when Norwegian Bliss goes to Alaska. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: That does it for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, guys. So Frank or Wendy, your third quarter yield guidance or constant yield guidance was 2.5% and it came to about 90 basis points higher than that. Can you help us understand what's the biggest delta of that change versus your guidance that you gave, given there was only 50 days left in the quarter the last time you guys reported. And I know the release says improved pricing, but can you give a little bit more color on that? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Sure. Good morning, Steve. It's primarily related to higher participation with our casino player program. So, that's a good thing. But it definitely we saw more participation than what we had anticipated at the time that we gave our guidance. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: So it's part of onboard revenue. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, so it really wasn't anything on the price side of things. It was more onboard driven? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, yes. I mean, ultimately it's going into our net yields but that's the largest driver was in onboard revenue with casino. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then second question. I don't know if you'll answer this or not, but if you exclude Europe from your full-year 2017 commentary, is it fair to say the rest of your business would be up in both price and occupancy? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes, absolutely, Steve. Across-the-board Caribbean is performing very well. Hawaii, Bermuda, and when we say Europe, we have to be careful because the Baltic is performing very, very well. Continues to perform well, it performed well in 2016. So in a nutshell, 2017 depends on Mediterranean. And again, we're cautious about Mediterranean bookings, but the last 8 weeks, 10 weeks have been very strong compared to the same period last year. And, it's important the last 8 weeks to 10 weeks last year were record setting, and were before the series of geopolitical events occurred. So if I'm comparing just the last 8 weeks to 10 weeks, that gives me encouragement in an environment today that is post-geo events, versus the same period last year prior geo events and I'm up, that gives me encouragement that if it continues, the Mediterranean will be a positive contributor towards 2017's result as opposed to it being as negative as it was for 2016. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, got you. And last simple question for you, Frank. The Breakaway Plus Ship for 2019, any update in terms of where that ship might be deployed? I know you've talked before about China. I know you had to make that decision by the end of this year and we haven't heard anything yet at this point. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, we're still on track to make a decision at the end of this year and we'll give you an update at the next earnings call as to which way we're going. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Staying on the Med and Europe you operate, given that we sort of seeing a quiet window, incident window thankfully and hopefully it continues here, what are you seeing from the industry's perspective here? Would the industry be maybe saying, okay, the pricing is improving, or North American sources are improving here over the last 2.5 months? Let's get that on the books rather than pushing price more. How do you see that dynamic more so from an industry perspective or if you want to comment from Norwegian's perspective. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, at least my philosophy is first you make sure you have a good base of occupancy. We were much further behind in obtaining that occupancy for 2017 Mediterranean cruising especially for Q3 and beyond last time we spoke than we are today is the result of that strong performance I have been talking about for the last 8 weeks or 10 weeks. We have closed the gap. And if this continues for the next 8 weeks until yearend, where we had some softness last year as the effect of Paris and then San Bernardino started to take place, we have some year-over-year comps that we believe if the current environment continues, we'll be able to beat. So, look, I think that 2017 is a year of reconciliation for Mediterranean. I don't think it's going to be a record year. I think it'll be a much better year than 2016. We won't see the dilution of pricing throughout the booking cycle as we saw last year due to the successive events, each successive events caused more vacuum in the system and more pricing pressure. So, I see for example, that occupancy should be better this year than last year. If you recall our Q3 occupancy is a couple points below what we did in 2015. We believe that should reverse itself. And our expectations for pricing improvement are very much tempered for 2017. It's very much a show-me. I'm encouraged by what's happened in the last 8 weeks to 10 weeks, but 8 weeks to 10 weeks doesn't make an entire booking cycle. If it continues, we'll have better news to share with you at the next earnings call. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you. And I guess that would lead in \u2013 then as a follow-up on some previous questions here to the definition of double-digits versus your prior 90 days ago, the 15% to 25%. Just any definition or range that you can give us on double digit? I mean, I guess, the inference here would be that clearly it's not the 15% to 25% it was. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Look we all know what double-digit means. I don't want to get cute with you. I don't want to suggest we're walking away from our prior indication. I just want to let you know that those two events occurred. Not events, but those two factors are now weighing against. Quite frankly if the FX turns positively and fuel prices drop, those factors which are negative today can turn positive. But, I think we ought to leave guidance once for the next call. We'll have 90 more days under our belt, have a much better view about 2017, certainly for first half, and a much better view for second half, which is the one, quite frankly, that is more of a question mark today. So, again, you shouldn't read a bear story into it. You shouldn't read a bull story into it. I think that we have performed relatively well this year against some difficult -- in a difficult environment. At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we'll deliver earnings per share of 18% plus. And we want to hopefully continue that trend into the future. But I just assume not give you any more details on 2017 than we already have. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. And last question : Wendy, you cited on the interest expense a little bit in Q3 here the move in LIBOR. Granted the moves we're seeing today in the markets in general, who knows where that shakes out after a few weeks, year or month or so, but when we look at the 10-year today and I know that's different from LIBOR, but can you give us any sensitivity on your interest expense exposure for 2017 as it stands? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. So, first off, for Q3, that equated to about $2.3 million in interest expense, and it's about 47 bps year-over-year or potentially, say, $0.06 from a EPS standpoint for full-year. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. You said $0.06. I'm sorry Wendy? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: $0.06 EPS impact... Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. And... Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: About 50 basis points. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : How should we think about it in sensitivity of LIBOR or however you want to determine for 2017? Just on an annual basis? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hard to say. A 50 basis point change is about $0.06. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is open. Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. So just kind of thinking about Europe again asked a little bit differently. How much of the second half do you have remaining to book? Because if you're seeing better pricing, better bookings and I think the double-digit that was in reference to price? And you have easier comparisons beginning in mid-November, but then you said it should be a record year. I'm just trying to understand, how much can you move the needle as we get into next year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: You're talking about 2017, Greg? Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): 2017, correct. Yes. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: So there is a lot of inventory yet to book for second half of 2017. If you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we said that on a load basis, the second half is flattish to where we were this time last year with pricing down. And so the good news is I've been mentioning that over the last 8 weeks to 10 weeks, we have seen booking volume exceed that of the same 8 weeks to 10-week period last year, so that we have eaten into the gap that existed. We still have a gap, and if the last 8 weeks or 10 weeks repeat themselves, let's say, over the last 8 weeks of the year to the end of the year, we ought to end the year slightly ahead. But it all depends on whether we continue to realize the trends that we've seen over the last 8 weeks to 10 weeks, which have been strong versus last year, both in load and in pricing. Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Right. Right, okay. Good. That's helpful. And then just on China. Can you give us a little more color as you talk to other, some of your big travel partners there, just how the market has been progressing over the last few months, just to give us a different perspective? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. I'm not hearing negative charter coming out of China. I think that some of the challenges that may have occurred in the last 24 months ago seemed to have waned a bit. I think part of it is, is that the capacity expansion into China in 2017 is somewhat tempered compared to prior years. For example into the Shanghai arena that we're going to be bringing our Norwegian Joy into. If you exclude Norwegian Joy as a participant, capacity in Shanghai is actually slightly down. And so, I'm seeing a pretty positive environment. I know that from our own business, we're very, very pleased with the pace of which our charter contracts are coming in in terms of volume, in terms of what percentage of our capacity is being filled. And I'm very, very pleased at the pricing. The pricing continues to be in line with our previous indication of which, if you recall, it was some 20% better than the Norwegian fleet average. So overall, I think that most competitors if not all competitors, seem to be less or more confident about China than perhaps they were this time last year where there was some question marks. So overall, it's good. We're excited about our growing traction and presence there. Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right, thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. Thanks everyone for your time and support. It's always a pleasure to speak to all of you. And as always, we will be available to answer your questions the rest of the day. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. 2016 was yet another year of solid financial performance, with revenue approaching a record $5 billion and adjusted earnings per share at an all-time high of $3.41, an 18% improvement over 2015. These results build on successive years of strong financial performance, resulting in a fivefold increase in earnings per share and a near doubling of revenue since 2013, the year of our initial public offering. Since that time, we have reached several key milestones and we look forward to more achievements in 2017 and beyond, including our much anticipated entry this summer into the Chinese cruise market with Norwegian Joy, which I will update you on later in the call, historic sailings to Cuba on all three of our award-winning brands and extending our growth profile well into the future with an order for the next generation of new ships for the Norwegian Cruise Line brand. 2017 is off to a solid start. The booking momentum we experienced leading up to our last earnings call has accelerated into wave season, enabling us to build a strong base of business. As of today, and even excluding the benefits of Norwegian Joy, we are in the best booked position in the company's history. We've seen strong booking volumes for all major destinations and a resurgence in demand from North American consumers for European sailings across all three of our brands. Leading up to year-end, our primary focus has been to build occupancy in order to make up for the slowdown in demand we experienced last year. Since the beginning of the year, the revenue management bias has shifted to increased pricing. As I said before, the key to optimizing net revenue is executing on what I call CYA. First, focus on the C, which is to fill capacity, and we've made tremendous progress in this area and are now significantly better booked compared to the same time last year. Next, the focus pivots to the Y, or yield and pricing, which started to come into focus in Q4, and given our excellent booked position, is now front and center, which is allowing us to leverage our pricing power. And lastly, the A, which is to minimize customer acquisition costs, and which remains in line with our expectations. Today, our record booked position, which inherently means less inventory to sell, coupled with an improving operating environment, allows us to focus on maximizing price for the remaining unsold inventory. On our last call in November, I mentioned that business as of that time had begun to improve across all major deployment areas over the previous eight-week period versus the same time last year, particularly from North American consumers and primarily as a result of a calmer geopolitical environment. Since that time, and post the election, the geopolitical environment has remained calm, and business has continued to improve, as booking volumes have accelerated and pricing has firmed. In the last eight-week period, or since the beginning of the year, business has really taken off and has been the most robust since the financial crisis some 10 years ago. As a result, and again excluding the benefits of Norwegian Joy, we are now significantly better booked than the same time last year for the full year and for each quarter of 2017, with pricing for the full year up slightly. First half pricing is up mid-single digits. Consistent with our expectations and again excluding the benefits of Norwegian Joy, second half pricing, while improving rapidly, is currently down low-single digits as a result of a few factors. First, we have yet to fully lap the period in 2016 that was most negatively impacted by slowing demand and pricing erosion in the wake of last year's successive geopolitical events. Second, the internationally sourced business that had been on the books last year at this time wore a (7:33) stronger foreign exchange rates prior to the Brexit vote. And lastly, in 2016, we reaped the benefits of an extended premium price charter of Norwegian Getaway in conjunction with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. While these factors bridge the year-over-year gap in second half pricing at this point in time, going forward, we expect pricing on remaining inventory to benefit from the following factors. First, as we move through the year, new business will benefit from higher pricing as we lap the period impacted by the aforementioned pricing and demand erosion. Second, our European and other premium itineraries are heavily weighted to the back half of the year, and as we move through the booking cycle, we have the opportunity to continue to fill these sailings at higher prices. Should business continue to perform as it has over the prior eight weeks, our remaining inventory would sell at significantly higher prices versus same time last year. To give you some context on the extent of the rebound in pricing, over the last eight weeks, pricing on newly booked business is up double digits across all three brands, with Mediterranean itineraries leading the way. Turning to more recent developments, and as you know, we have been expecting to receive approval to sail to Cuba for quite some time. So I'm tremendously excited about the upcoming sailings in all three of our brands beginning next month with Oceania's Marina. In the last few weeks, we also announced 25 additional sailings, with weekly round trip cruises from Miami to Havana aboard Norwegian Sky as well as six new departures on Oceania Cruises. We are thrilled to be the first cruise line to offer weekly sailings from Port Miami with overnight stays in Cuba's historically and culturally rich capital, Havana, through December of 2017. While we have realized meaningful pricing premiums on these first 10 sailings to Cuba across all three brands, it is too early to determine how much of this premium is sustainable over the long run, given the additional capacity that has been approved not only for our three brands but for other industry participants. And while the opening of Cuba is an exciting development for our industry and for our company in particular, it's important to note that Cuba-related inventory represents less than 2% of our total capacity, and therefore we do not expect a material financial benefit from Cuba-related sailings in 2017. Before I turn this call over to Wendy to review 2016 results and our outlook for 2017, I'd like to provide an update on our China operations. We continue to be big believers in the potential of China as an important source market. Our Norwegian Joy will arrive in Shanghai for her maiden voyage as scheduled in late June. As of this time, Norwegian Joy's occupancy for 2017 based on signed full and partial ship charter and group contracts with major travel agents is significantly ahead of the rest of the Norwegian brand fleet for the second half of the year at contracted prices that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that Joy will deliver pricing at a 20% premium to the Norwegian brand fleet. We have also stated in the past that by the end of 2016, a decision would be made regarding the design of the fourth Breakaway Plus Class vessels slated for delivery late in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result of the aforementioned strengths of charter and group contracts and related pricing, as well as the resounding feedback and popularity of Norwegian Joy's many unique and first at sea guest-facing features, we have chosen to design the fourth Breakaway Class vessel as a sister ship to Norwegian Joy. I'll return at the end of the call to discuss our exciting and recently announced newbuild order, but for now I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy to go over into our results and earnings expectations in more detail. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2016 and 2015 net yield and net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year results followed by color on booking trends, and then will close with our outlook in guidance for 2017. I'm pleased to report another record quarter of revenue and earnings. Fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.56, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.57. Adjusted net yield decreased 1.7%, or 2.2% on an as reported basis versus the prior year. Stronger than expected close-in demand resulted in adjusted net yield outperforming guidance expectations of down 2.25%. Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel decreased 0.7% on both a constant currency and as reported basis. Higher than expected expenses related to repairs and maintenance mainly due to a technical issue on Norwegian Star, as well as an increase in other ship operating expenses, resulted in costs coming in higher than guidance expectations. Looking back at 2016, it was another year of record revenue and earnings, and solid financial performance, despite the impact of geopolitical headwinds. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 18% to $3.41, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.38 to $3.42. Our strong earnings were driven by record revenue of $4.9 billion, representing a 12.2% increase from the prior year. Other key metrics for full-year 2016 are as follows : adjusted net yield for the year was up 1.8%, or 1.2% on an as reported basis. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel increased 1.7%, or 1.5% on an as reported basis. And fuel price per metric ton net of hedges decreased 13.5% to $466 from $539 in the prior year. We are proud to share that since 2006, we've reduced fuel consumption per capacity day by approximately 30%, as we continue to focus on fuel efficiency and energy saving initiatives, implementing new technologies and optimizing itineraries. Now let's discuss our outlook for 2017. On a full-year basis, our capacity is expected to increase approximately 6.5%, with the midyear addition of Norwegian Joy along with a partial year benefit from the annualization of Oceania Cruises' Sirena and Seven Seas Explorer. Looking at our deployment around the world, we believe we have an optimal mix of itineraries for 2017. The Caribbean will make up 37% of our deployment mix, with capacity in the region decreasing mid single digits from last year, primarily due to the redeployment of Norwegian Getaway to the higher priced Baltic region during the peak summer season. Europe, which will experience a capacity increase of approximately 10%, will comprise 23% of our deployment mix. We have made several changes to our European deployments, reducing our capacity in the Mediterranean region by approximately 10%, and significantly increasing our deployment in the Baltic and Northern Europe. As Frank mentioned earlier, we are seeing strong demand for European itineraries, particularly from North America. The Asia, Africa and Pacific region will experience a significant increase in capacity, with deployment mix increasing from 3% to 8%, primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Joy to the Chinese cruise market, as well as the deployment to Asia and Australia of Norwegian Star in the first part of the year, and Norwegian Jewel in the latter part of 2017. As for other markets, deployment is consistent year-over-year. Turning to the first quarter, capacity is expected to be up approximately 1.5% due to the addition of Seven Seas Explorer, and Oceania Cruises' Sirena, partially offset by an increase in the number of dry-docks in the quarter versus prior year. As for our deployment mix, the first quarter is very Caribbean-centric, with approximately 59% of our deployments allocated to the region. This reflects a capacity decrease of approximately 8%, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Star to the Asia-Pacific region along with a heavier weighting of dry-docks in the first quarter, which is partially offset by increased capacity in the region for both Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. This market continues to show strength, with price and occupancy both ahead of prior year. Turning to Europe, only 4% of our deployment mix is allocated to this region in the first quarter. This includes a 54% decrease in capacity, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Epic from Europe in the non-peak winter season to the peak season in the Caribbean. The Asia, Africa, Pacific region accounts for approximately 9% of our deployment mix which is up approximately 400 basis points from prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned redeployment of Norwegian Star to the region. As for other key markets, our deployment is similar to prior year. Now turning to our guidance, for the full year we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.85. Since our last earnings call, strong booking trends including the benefit of voyages to Cuba have offset headwinds from fuel and the impact from a technical issue on Norwegian Star. Adjusted net yield for the year is expected to increase approximately 1.75%, or 1.25% on an as reported basis. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 1%, on both a constant currency and as reported basis. As for the first quarter, adjusted net yield is anticipated to increase approximately 4.5%, or 4% on an as reported basis. The first quarter has a few positive year-over-year benefits, which will help to make this quarter the highest yield growth quarter in 2017. These benefits include Pride of America, the highest yielding ship in the Norwegian fleet, is in service for the full quarter, versus prior year where she was in a 25-day dry-dock. Norwegian Epic is sailing in the Caribbean peak season, garnering higher pricing in both ticket and onboard versus Q1 of 2016, where she sailed in Europe during the non-peak shoulder season. And the benefit from the addition of Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Sirena, both of which were not in our fleet in Q1 2016, and garner higher yields than the corporate average. Now turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 5.25% on both a constant currency and as reported basis. The first quarter also represents the highest growth quarter for adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel mainly due to the timing of dry-dock with five scheduled dry-docks occurring in the first quarter, compared to two dry-docks in the previous year. As well as the previously stated incremental expense of approximately $15 million related to the launch of our China operations, which will occur in the first half of the year. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $450, with expected consumption of approximately 190,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $0.36. As we mentioned last quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind for the balance of 2017. As mentioned last quarter, we will be up against tougher pricing comparisons in the third quarter when we lap the premium priced 40-day charter of Norwegian Getaway in the period. The third quarter also lapsed the introduction of Seven Seas Explorer, which entered the fleet in a premium market in peak summer season after experiencing record early bookings at the higher prices typically expected in an inaugural season. 2017 marks Explorer's first full year of operation, resulting in a normalization of pricing that takes into account both peak and non-peak season. And now to discuss our recent newbuild order, I'll turn over the call to Frank. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Wendy. As you know, we recently announced a major order for the next generation of ships for the Norwegian Cruise Line brand, extending our long-term growth profile to at least 2025. This four ship order expresses capacity increases smoothly from 2022 through 2025 with an option for two additional ships to be delivered in 2026 and 2027. Each ship will be 140,000 gross tons, accommodate approximately 3,300 guests, around built upon the highly successful Freestyle offerings found on Norwegian's most recent Breakaway Plus Class Ship. The addition of these vessels will allow us to substitute newer state-of-the-art vessels with a richer state room mix to our premium destinations, which in turn will allow us to redeploy existing vessels to other domestic and international home port, where we currently do not have a presence. In addition, the size of these vessels provides an optimal balance between deployment flexibility and earnings potential, allowing us to add new ports of call worldwide while maintaining a strong return profile with a payback of roughly five years, in line with our most recent newbuild. In addition, these ships have very attractive financing, with fixed interest rates for the first two vessels averaging 2.7% and the second two vessels at 1.25%. The expansion of our newbuild pipeline will drive meaningful revenue growth and will be accretive to both earnings per share and ROIC, further solidifying the key metrics that drive the financial success of our business. I know we've covered a lot of material on today's call, and I'd like to take time now to answer your questions. So, Nicole, please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Dobson of Nomura. Your line is now open. Brian H. Dobson - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hey, how are you this morning? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good. Thank you. Brian H. Dobson - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hey, so would you mind elaborating a little bit on your net yield growth outlook? Specifically how introducing new Norwegian ships impacts your growth trajectory there? There's been a bit of confusion about the comparability between you and Royal. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Sure, that's a great question. Thank you. So due to the mix of our portfolio brands, as we bring on Norwegian newbuilds, which are highly accretive to both revenue and earnings, their yields are slightly dilutive to our corporate average, which includes our higher yield brands that make up approximately a third of our gross revenue. In other words, the addition of a new Norwegian vessel which has yields lower than the corporate average inherently dilutes yields. In addition, in 2017 we are also annualizing both the Explorer and Sirena to include the non-peak season. We also do not have the benefit from the Getaway charter, which garnered a significant yield premium in the third quarter of 2016. So again, I'd just reiterate that Q1 is where you'll see the highest yield and then obviously that implies that the back half of the year then is much more moderate. Brian H. Dobson - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great, thanks, that's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is now open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Frank, I was wondering if you could reconcile your guidance for the remainder of the year with some of the comments you made towards the end of your prepared remarks regarding the potential pricing benefits you could see later in the year. So just help me kind of cull through that all. Is it fair to say that your guidance is what you're seeing now, that is the color you gave regarding the second half pricing being down, or being kind of in the low single-digit range, down low-single digits, but there is opportunity to be above that based on the potential benefit from the easier Europe comps in the second half and your comment that premium itineraries are moving up in price? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi, Felicia. So, yes. Look, several headlines here. First one is that business has been very, very strong, as strong as we've seen it in a long, long time during the last eight-week period, and even sneaking into a little bit into Q4 of last year. So I think what my prepared statement said is, should that trend continue, we ought to see the back half inventory sell at higher prices than what already sold for that back half of sailings. Remember that we have yet to lap, or yet to fully lap, the negative impact of all the cumulative effects of the geopolitical events that we saw throughout last year. A lot of the business that's on the books today was booked during that stressful time. And so as we come out of that and I think we have come out of it, and business continues to improve and pricing continues to move up, the blended pricing of those sailings when they actually take place should be higher than they are today. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right, but you're not \u2013 so just to kind of put it out there, but you're not seeing that now, so you're not putting it in your guidance yet. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We have not extrapolated what we have seen the last eight weeks into the rest of the unsold inventory. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. And, Frank, just can you help us understand, knowing that you haven't lapped the kind of easier Europe situation, can you kind of help us understand the performance of your three brands in Europe, what you're seeing now in the second and third quarter? You kind of gave us a consolidated \u2013 and I know you don't like to talk about brand-by-brand, but maybe just directionally kind of how they're each performing. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No, that's an easy one, because all three brands, and therefore at the H (28:35) level, are all performing extremely well in Europe. High tide floats all boats so to speak, and this is the case now. So the Explorer continues to do incredibly well, no question the highest yielding ship in the industry, but the rest of the fleet, whether it's an Oceania or a Norwegian vessel or other Regent vessels, are all doing very well, as I said earlier. Pricing has been very strong the last eight weeks, double digits, with Mediterranean itineraries leading the way. The Med last year took the biggest bow, and this year it's taking the largest increase. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Helpful. And just last one : Wendy, just on your cost guidance, the 1% was a bit better than the kind of 1% to 2% you've discussed in the past, so just wondering what's driving the better outlook. And I know that you've kind of made it very clear what the drivers for the higher expenses were in the quarter, but I just wanted to make sure that there weren't any costs that you expected in 2017 that you were able to bring it to the end of the year in 2016. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We have been working very, very hard on a number of supply chain initiatives that have been actively being worked all through 2016 and 2017, so we're getting the benefit of that, as well as we're also getting the benefit of scale, as we bring in the Norwegian Joy and leverage the rest of our costs. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is now open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. So I just wanted to clarify \u2013 your commentary about bookings excludes the Joy in the release, but your fuel guidance includes it. And so if we look after Q1, because you have that strong increase in yield in Q1, it looks like sort of Q2 to Q4, you're looking for about 1% yield guidance, just doing the back of the envelope math. And it seems like the Norwegian Joy alone would add more than that if you take, like, a 20% premium, and it's 8%, and in fact in the last three quarters it would be slightly more than 8%. So I guess the math I'm getting to \u2013 is your guidance suggesting that that yield will be down for the rest of the fleet in the second half? I know you talked about how trends have been improving the last eight weeks, but it sounds like your guidance is assuming that even though prices'll be higher than what's on the books today, they'll still end up being lower year-over-year. Am I doing the math right on that? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay, so good question, Robin. I would again point to the fact that it's dilutive to yields, as you bring in \u2013 or not meaning \u2013 it's not increasing. Norwegian ships are not increasing the yields, so the Joy is coming in on par with the average of the NCLH average yield. So it's not increasing it. It's still going to be one of the highest yielding ships in the Norwegian fleet, but it's dilutive to the overall NC \u2013 or at least not accretive to the overall NCLH yield. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, and I think the big difference is that our company has a good portion of their inventory, of their capacity, with the PCH fleet that has a completely different pricing profile than the Norwegian fleet. The Norwegian new vessels still garner double-digit yield growth compared to the legacy fleet on a like-to-like basis, and we've said repeatedly that we expect the Joy to bring home prices 20% higher than the Norwegian's average. Still, based on the corporate yield, it is around a push. It is not expected to increase yields significantly, although it does increase revenue tremendously, and earnings per share tremendously. So what we're trying to get across is, focus on revenue growth, focus on earnings per share growth, because for us, yield growth is a secondary story, not the primary. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And then the other things that I mentioned that were rolling over, so all \u2013 the Explorer, the Sirena and the Getaway Charter. For that reason, when you look at the yields being highest in Q1, you can imply then by our full-year guidance that yields will be much more tempered in the back part of the year. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then one other question clarifying on \u2013 and then just a follow-up. I know some of the other lines that operate in China have talked about how at this time last year, they felt great about China, and then having chartered everything, and then travel sellers came back and they had to do things on the back end that ended up bringing yields down lower than what was factored in. So just thinking about your commentary about what's on the books today, which sounds very strong, are you factoring into your guidance that where you've chartered it is where it will end up? I mean, obviously there's less supply in China this year than last year, so just wondering if your assumption is that, in your guidance, is that you may end up taking some back, or do you feel like where you've chartered it is where the year would end up? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I think you hit the primary nail on the head when you said that supply growth is very much tempered this year versus last year. Supply is actually up, but up only 9% in Shanghai, where our vessel will be deployed, versus nearly 100% this time last year. So the factors of supply and demand are well in place in China, like it is everywhere else in the world. But yes, we have in addition to the fact that we believe that the market this year in China is more stable, it's one more year of maturity, et cetera. We do have provisions for exactly what you mentioned and it's all baked into our yield guidance. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Your line is now open. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Question about the first quarter, the first quarter guide for you guys on the yield side. And I guess I \u2013 we understand Pride of America and we understand Explorer and Sirena, but still, even taking those into account, it seems like the yield expectations a decent amount higher than I think what most folks were expecting. So does it come down to the Caribbean has booked out better than what you guys would've expected a couple months ago? And I know you guys had some deployment issues there in the fourth quarter of last year, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how strong the Caribbean pricing has been over the last, call it a couple months. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: The Caribbean is good. Caribbean is strong. We have some sailings in Q3 (sic) [Q1] that include Cuba, and we said that we've enjoyed meaningful premium pricing on those sailings, which has helped. We also have the Explorer in the Caribbean, which has performed very, very well. So it's never one thing. It's a combination of factors, but overall, the Caribbean is strong. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, got you. And the second question would be around the European cruise market and your sourcing strategies over there. I know when you looked back to last year, you guys were clearly impacted the most as you are a little bit more reliant on the North American side of things. But what have you guys done, Frank, in terms of to start changing your sourcing strategies over there and get more locals onboard? Or is it you're kind of not going down that path and staying more reliant on the North American side of things? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: You know, when business is good, it tends to be good in multiple areas, in multiple channels, and that's what we're seeing. So clearly, the North American consumer is more engaged this year, and we expect it to continue to be engaged as the year moves along, versus what happened last year in the geopolitical arena. And so the pressure for us to source away from North America is lessened. As a result of this lessening pressure, the pricing that we're garnering for international source business has also improved. So in 2017, we expect our international business, ex-Joy, to be up about 10%. So we are sourcing more in international markets than we did in 2016, but the good news is we're not having to do it out of stress. We're doing it in a position of strength, because the North American market, which is the tempo-setter, so to speak, is doing so well. So pricing overall is also finding its way into our international source market. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, guys, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Savino from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Wondering if you could maybe just address the supply picture real quick, particularly in the luxury segment where there's a bunch of new ships coming online. Just wondering if you are seeing any competitive pressure, or if you do think that you're able to kind of find enough demand to meet those needs. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. The first competitive pressure always comes from within, so in 2016, both the Oceania brand and the Regent brand took on new capacity. We don't have that this year, although in the case of Regent, it does lap for half a year in the case of the Sirena, and Oceania, it laps for about eight months. So in our own world, capacity has been somewhat tempered, but no, I look \u2013 2017 is much better booked across all destinations. Booking the last eight weeks have been at significantly higher prices than the prior year. Overall pricing is still below where it was this time last year for the upscale brands, but clearly as the year progresses and we start lapping the erosion that took place last year, and if business continues to perform as it has in the last eight weeks, that gap will shorten. But what the status is today on a year-over-year basis, and compare that to how it ended last year, is a very different story as we go through the booking cycle. Look, capacity in the upscale area has always been lumpy, because there are so few brands, so few ships, but it is not grotesquely outside the \u2013 if I recall, the growth in 2016 was some 14%, moderating to a CAGR of something in the neighborhood of 6% for the 2019 to 2022 period. That's not a whole lot different than what we see in the more contemporary space. So I'm not too worried about it. And some of those ships, quite frankly, that have been talked about in the 2019-2022 period, I'm not sure they ever come to fruition. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's really helpful color. Shifting gears real quick just to leverage and the balance sheet, it looks like leverage is still kind of on track to be subbed 4 times by sometime in the back half of the year, so wonder if you could maybe give your latest thoughts on a potential capital return strategy? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Great question. So, yes, as of the end of 2016, on a pro forma basis, we actually were at 3.98 times, but still at 4.34 times on an as-reported basis and de-levering rapidly. So on an as-reported basis, we will be at 4 times by the end of the year, and we stay consistent with our plans that we want to continue to de-lever, and that will allow us to return capital to our shareholders in the back half of the year. So we continue to be favorable towards share repurchases, but we'll be opportunistic and look at our options. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Frank, just a clarification, if you would, on a couple of items. One, the international sourcing, did you say that was up 10% ex-Joy in 2017? And then, also the financing cost on the newbuild orders number 3 and 4, that's a clarification. And then as it relates to adjustments for net yield, Wendy, just kind of more of a definitional question there, if I may. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hey, Tim. So the financing, the interest rate on newbuilds 3 and 4, the average is 1.25%, and... Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Fixed? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Fixed, yes, sir. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And on international sourcing, the 10% is we expect international sourcing ex-Joy in terms of revenue to be up 10%. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Which implies the higher pricing that I discussed. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And then, Tim, with regard to adjustments to net yield, that actually ended in Q1 of 2016, so you won't see that any longer. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, that's what I thought it was related to. And then as a follow-up, and by the way, thank you for the additional color on the dynamics of the net yield between the brands there. But as additional follow-up, can you talk a little bit, Wendy, about how you roll on fuel hedges on a go-forward basis? And have you seen any change in the percentage that you look strategy long term here, as you de-lever? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Sure. So our strategy has remained consistent. Inherently we say that we want to be at least 50% hedged as we move into a new year. We're significantly higher than that this year at 78% hedged. It is a mixture between HFO and MGO, and hopefully investors and analysts have found it helpful with additional color that we provided in the last couple of quarters and also in this quarter, breaking that out. So of the 78% that's hedged, then you also have the correlations. We're floating approximately 30%, somewhere in there, and we do use the fuel curves. Next year, we're at 66% hedged, and the following years we're at 48% and 18% hedged. But in those outer years, in 2019 and 2020, we'll continue to be opportunistic. That's what we've done, so we will continue to see benefits of our fuel hedges as we move into those outer years. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Would you hedge less going forward or a higher mix of the higher sulfur fuel as your capacity shifts to China? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I think we've got a nice balance right now as to what we've presently hedged between HFO and MGO. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein. Your line is now open. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks a lot for the question. Just wanted to quickly first clarify that I think you plan to spend $30 million in China this year. And as a follow-up to that, if that's true, how much do you expect to spend in China going forward? And how should we expect that spending cadence to ramp as you now plan to expand your fleet in that region? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, so $30 million is what we said our total SG&A spending including marketing and sales initiatives will be in 2017. My guess is that that'll be the run rate through 2018, and as 2019 approaches, that likely will go up when the additional inventory arrives in China. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, in light of recent technology announcements from some of your peers, I was wondering if you could sort of broadly comment on your technology strategy going forward and remind us exactly how your on-board customer-facing technology today compares with some of your peers. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Well, listen, we're very impressed with what Carnival announced a few weeks ago. We think it's a step in the right direction, and we're certainly going to be keeping an eye on customer acceptance and to see whether it moves the needle. We have had a program, an app \u2013 a mobile app that accomplishes some of the things that this newer technology tries to accomplish, so we're going to be continuing to focus on the app that we have out there. It's proven to be pretty popular with our guests, and enhancing it in ways that allows us to do a lot of what the other technology tries to accomplish perhaps at a lower cost. Second, as you may know, we recently launched a digital bidding platform that allows guests to upgrade their staterooms, and that is very much incremental to yield. And lastly, we've done a pretty good job, we think, of building technology into the Norwegian Joy with many virtual reality features. That is resonating very, very well in the Chinese marketplace and we think is one of the reasons why Norwegian Joy is booking as well as it has, that we are studying to see if we can leverage the concepts across other vessels in the fleet. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very interesting. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, you said that if you were to extrapolate out the last eight weeks, that the remaining inventory in the second half of the year would sell at higher rates. Can you just quantify that to give us some context? How much higher would that be? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I mentioned in my prepared notes that the last eight weeks' pricing is up double digits. I'd like to leave it at that. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So I guess it makes it a little tricky just to determine what's embedded in guidance with that 1.75% without knowing exactly... Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Jared, let me make it clear. We have not interpolated, we have not implied in our 1.75% guidance that what we've seen in the last eight weeks will continue, so it's zero. Zero influence, yeah. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, and then if you were to just take out the first quarter and just look at 2Q through the end of the year, can you give us an idea of what your booked position would look like now relative to this time last year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. It's up for the first half. Load is up high-single digits. Pricing is up mid-single digits. For the second half of the year, load is again up very high-single digits. And as I mentioned earlier, pricing is slightly down, but improving rapidly. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the recent trends in sourcing. I guess what percentage of the strong recent bookings are coming from new-to-cruise customers in North America? And have the stronger booking trends run parallel with any changes in behavior on board that could affirm a stronger, more confident leisure consumer? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi, Stephen (50:11). On the on-board side, we saw some weakness in on-board revenue in October of Q4, and almost miraculously right after the election, when I think the euphoria began, on-board revenues have been strong. They were strong in November and December, and continued through January, so we're hopeful that trend also continues. In terms of sourcing, we've said in the past that we think we have an outside opportunity to gain market share by doing a better job of mining our own past guests. Certainly at the Norwegian brand, we've seen past guests come back to the Norwegian brand up 13% since 2015, and we expected that trend to somewhat moderate, but still be in the mid- to high-single digits in 2017, and so we focused our marketing because we know who they are, we know where they live. We have all their contact information. And we think that's a very efficient source of additional sourcing for us. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman of Wedbush. Your line is now open. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking may call. I guess a couple follow-ups here. I just want to make sure I understand the difference between improvements that were expected, I guess, versus unexpected. Obviously it seems like versus the commentary you gave us three months ago, the full year booking and pricing outlook has improved, although the guidance basically gets us in that low-double-digit earnings growth. So was it that that improvement was already factored into your previous sort of earnings growth expectation or was that offset by other factors, be it currency or whatever else? And then as we look forward, and this has been asked, I guess, a couple times; maybe let me ask it a different way, it seems like the assumption that you're making on the remaining bookings in the second half of the year is that it's better than what's already booked, right, that the low-single-digit declines, but not nearly as strong as what we've seen in the last eight weeks. Is that the best way to think about that in terms of your guidance and how the remaining rooms book up? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: So, James, good morning. Fuel has actually moved up about 20% since our last call. I also had made mention of the Star technical issues that we had, so those were additional headwinds that we faced, but we have offset those additional headwinds by this strong operational environment as well as the 41 announced voyages to Cuba. So there's nothing further that we have implanted into our guidance for 2017. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And in terms of the pricing and the yield and the unsold inventory, look, demand is better across the board. It's better from North America. It's better from the international source market. Europe, which was the underperformer last year, is doing significantly better. Our guidance, to be specific, again, does not take in consideration what we've seen in the last eight weeks. Eight weeks does not make an entire year. We've seen that movie before about this time last year, so we're being cautious about that. What we said about the European theater bookings, and we said it last quarter, was that we were going to assume that 2017's pricing for Europe would be the same as how it ended in 2016. And that's about how it was through most of Q4. In late Q4, we saw a pickup, and as I said in my opening statements, the Mediterranean has really outperformed all other destinations in the last eight weeks. So should it continue, then we would see an up in pricing, an up in yields, but it's a big should. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: That's really helpful. And then I guess maybe just help us to put the guidance, both the yield and the cost guidance, maybe in a bigger picture perspective. The 1.75% increase for this year, obviously you've got the Norwegian brand weighing on that to a degree, but I would assume that you're going to add more Norwegian ships than Prestige going forward. How should we think about that in the context of the typical year and what we might expect yields to grow? And then on the cost side, do we get to a point now that a lot of the Chinese investments are at least in the numbers that we can see that number flatten out in future years in terms of net cruise costs? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, so on the yield side, you're correct. As of today, excluding Joy, which comes in later this year, we have two more Breakaway Plus Class vessels coming in 2018 and 2019 for the Norwegian brand, and we have the four vessels that we just announced for the Norwegian brand starting in 2022, and we only have one small 750-passenger ship coming for the upscale brands in late 2019 or early 2020. So you can see that the inventory is skewing greatly towards the Norwegian brand, and as the Norwegian brand adds more vessels, even though those vessels generate tremendous cash flow, great profitability, very, very accretive to earnings per share, a ton of revenues to the top line, if you're only focusing on yield growth, then it will be a number that is less than spectacular because this is no longer a yield growth story. This is all about earnings per share growth, revenue growth, and the yield growth is still important. We want to grow yield, and we will grow yield, but it's not what to focus on. It's all about the mix of our brands, mix of our ships within those brands. And in terms of the China, yeah, like anything else, China is a startup for us, so we expect to have higher costs as we enter the market for the first time in 2017 on a per-berth basis than we expect to incur in 2018 and 2019 as more capacity is added to that marketplace. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Nicole, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Perfect, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering on a high level, bridging from the initial $5 to the more recent $3.80, obviously there's been a number of things that have changed, but could you help understand just kind of the buckets or the big drivers in terms of currency, fuel, obviously Europe profitability tied to events and then maybe the Caribbean? Like, how would you kind of slice up that delta? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: First off, I would say the vast majority of this is the reset from the revenue from 2016, which then you're starting with a lower base rolling into 2017. So Q2 of last year on our earnings call, we did specifically talk about 70% of the reset was specifically due to the geopolitical headwinds that we had faced. So, that's the lion share, but then there is also fuel and FX that also has been affected, all well baked within our guidance to say that we would be within double-digit EPS growth in 2017 and moving forward. So revenue the largest, and then fuel and FX. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your time and support. And as always, we will be available to answer your questions later in the day. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

With that I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. 2017 has started out strong and I'm pleased to report solid Q1 results. The lively booking momentum we witnessed leading up to our last earnings call continued through the rest of the quarter and into the second quarter to-date, resulting in the best wave season that we and likely the industry has experienced in quite some time. This momentum has resulted in strong booking volumes, coupled with double-digit pricing growth versus same time last year. This positive trend was seen across all our major destinations for all three brands from North American and internationally sourced business. Europe sailings in particular continue to show renewed strength as a result of robust demand from North American consumers with pricing up well into double digits over the last 16-week period, compared to the same time last year. The Caribbean market continues to show strength as well, and is ahead low single-digits in load factor and up high single digits in pricing for the full year versus 2016. In addition, the newest destination in our portfolio of itineraries, Cuba, has and is performing extremely well, both in booking volumes and pricing, which is complementing the overall positive momentum for the year. Since our last call, all three of our brands have now sailed to Havana, and the load factors and pricing premiums on these initial voyages have been very encouraging. This robust operating environment is driven by a strong consumer demand, reasonably priced airfares especially to Europe, and buoyed by a stock market at all time highs. And is being complemented by both our revenue optimization strategies and effective marketing campaigns. Additionally, we have been able to improve the quality of international booked business year-over-year, which is now booking at parity to North American business. These factors have allowed us to focus on raising prices across all our channels, while still driving the required booking volumes necessary to achieve healthy net yield growth. The trifecta of a strong operating environment, a clear revenue optimization strategy, and effective marketing has resulted in our booked position exceeding prior-year levels and at higher prices. We are now significantly better booked in the same time last year for the full year, and for each of the remaining quarters of 2017, both including and excluding Norwegian Joy. Pricing for the full year is now up mid-single digits with first half pricing now up high single digits. Consistent with our expectations, we have priced remaining 2017 inventory at higher prices as we now have closed the year-over-year pricing gap for sailings in the second half of the year. The expectation continues to be that pricing for new bookings for second half sailings will moderately exceed prior-year levels as we fully lap the pricing declines that occurred during 2016. And while it is still relatively early to fully comment on 2018 business, the strong booking and pricing momentum we realized for all three brands over the last five months to six months has extended well into next year, buoyed by the mid-year introduction of Norwegian Bliss, which is in a far better booked position, both in terms of load and price at this point in time prior to her first sail date as compared to previous Breakaway Class introductions. Turning to more current events, our entry into the Chinese cruise market reached two milestones recently. First, a little over two weeks ago, we officially took delivery of Norwegian Joy. She has now begun her repositioning journey from Germany to China, where she will be showcased through a grand inaugural port tour featuring one-day events at the ports of Qingdao, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong, as well as VIP partner cruises with major travel agents from Norwegian Joy's home port of Shanghai and Tianjin. The ship will then be christened in an exclusive event for honored guests on June 27th, led by her Godfather, the king of Chinese pop, Wang Leehom. Second, we recently announced the launch of our partnership with the Alibaba Group, China and the world's largest online and mobile commerce company. This exciting partnership brings together Norwegian's depth and experience of delivering innovative cruise vacations with Alibaba's extensive insights into the wants and needs of Chinese consumers to help target and attract more Chinese travelers to choose a cruise vacation. The partnership kicked off last week with a sweepstake where lucky Alibaba customers won a special four-day preview cruise roundtrip from Shanghai on board Norwegian Joy. We look forward to welcoming these guests on board in early June to showcase Norwegian Joy to the Chinese traveling public for the first time, and to help celebrate our partnership with Alibaba. The amount of coverage and awareness that Norwegian Cruise Line and Norwegian Joy received as a result of this campaign and new partnership was impressive. While we are in the early stages of this partnership it does present a unique opportunity to leverage the complete Alibaba ecosystem to reach not just potential guests, but the right potential guests, and will serve to elevate our brand's awareness in China and support our consumer sales. As for the booking environment in China, up through early March we were very pleased with the pace of new charter contracts and group contracts. Since then, the South Korean travel restriction has caused disruption in the cruise sector resulting the rearranging of itineraries throughout the industry for voyages departing from Mainland China. The result has been a slowdown in the signing of new charter contracts, and major groups as travel agents focus on filling the closer-in sailings that were first affected by the travel restriction. While Norwegian Joy's first revenue sailing is not until June 28, a full 49 days away, and due to the close-in booking nature of the Chinese end consumer, at this time it is too soon to determine if voyages in the second half of the year will be similarly impacted. It should be noted that while new charter contracts have slowed since early March, Norwegian Joy is still better booked in the form of contracted charter space than the rest of the Norwegian fleet at contracted prices consistent with our prior expectations. As a result, while fundamentals of our core business continue to impress, the uncertainties surrounding the South Korea situation for cruises out of China are partially mitigating tailwinds emanating from the rest of our fleet. All these factors taken as a whole, together with our increased investment in marketing spend, which Wendy will cover in just a moment, I'm pleased to report an increase in our full-year guidance for both adjusted net yield growth and adjusted earnings per share. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy to discuss our results and earnings expectations in more detail. Wendy? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Unless otherwise noted my commentary compares 2017 and 2016 adjusted net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our first quarter results followed by color on booking trends, and then we'll close with our outlook and guidance for second quarter, and full year 2017. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance with record revenue. This quarter also marks the 35th consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA growth. First quarter results came in ahead of expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 above guidance of approximately $0.36, driven by strong close-in demand in the Caribbean, coupled with strength in onboard revenue, which drove outperformance in top-line results. Adjusted net yield increased 5.5% or 4.9% on an as-reported basis versus the prior year, outperforming guidance expectations of up 4.5%. Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 5.8% on both a constant currency and as-reported basis. Higher than expected expenses related to repairs and maintenance and other ship operating expenses primarily related to technical issues with Norwegian Star, resulted in costs coming in slightly higher than guidance. Turning to fuel, our fuel expense per metric ton net of hedges increased 3.4%, to $453 from $438 in the prior year. Taking a look below the line, interest expense net decreased to $53 million, compared to $59.8 million in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in average debt balances outstanding partially offset by an increase in LIBOR rates. Interest expense was favorable to guidance in part due to favorable rates, as well as the timing on the closing of the committed financing for Project Leonardo. Now let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Capacity is expected to increase approximately 5.5%, due to the benefit from the addition of Seven Seas Explorer, a partial quarter benefit of Oceania Cruises' Sirena, as well as the benefit from a decrease in the number of dry docks in the quarter versus prior year. As for our deployment mix, approximately 27% of our overall capacity is allocated in the Caribbean. This reflects a capacity decrease of approximately 24%, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Getaway to the Baltic region. Europe represents approximately 30% of our deployment mix in the second quarter. This includes an increase of approximately 24% in capacity, mainly due to the aforementioned repositioning of Norwegian Getaway to the region. As for other key markets, Alaska and Bermuda deployment mix account for approximately 10% each, Hawaii, approximately 5%, and the remainder primarily in South America and the Asia, Africa, Pacific regions. Now I would like to walk you through our guidance and expectations for the second quarter and full year 2017. Starting with the second quarter, adjusted net yield is anticipated to increase approximately 5.5% or 4.75% on an as-reported basis. The second quarter has a few positive year-over-year benefits which are driving strength in the top line. These benefits include the addition of Seven Seas Explorer which was not in our fleet in the second quarter last year, and a partial quarter of Oceania Sirena, both of which garner higher yields than the corporate average. The meaningful pricing premiums we are experiencing on the initial sailings to Cuba and the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell in Q2 versus Q1 in the prior year. In addition to the year-over-year benefits, the strong operating environment Frank discussed earlier has also benefited our second quarter outlook. Now, turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 2.75% on both a constant currency and as-reported basis. The expected increase is primarily due to the previously stated expenses related to our expansion into China, which are weighed more in the second quarter, prior to the launch of Norwegian Joy. Incremental marketing in China to stimulate demand and mitigate potential impacts of the South Korea travel restrictions, investment in additional marketing to promote future sailings to Cuba in order to maximize pricing premiums. These cost increases are partially offset by the year-over-year timing of dry docks, with two scheduled dry docks occurring in the second quarter, compared to five dry docks in the previous year. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $450 with expected consumption of approximately 185,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $0.95. Turning to the full year, as Frank mentioned in his opening remarks, the operating environment has remained strong, but uncertainties in China are partially mitigating this tailwind. Strength in our core markets have resulted in the raising of our outlook for adjusted net yield, which is now expected to increase 100 basis points, to approximately 2.75%, or 2.25% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is now expected to be up approximately 1.5% on both a constant currency and as-reported basis. As a result, we have raised your guidance range for adjusted earnings per share by $0.04 with expectations to now be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89. I would now like to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation strategy. While our primary focus continues to be the strengthening of our balance sheet through de-leveraging, our Board recently authorized an extension to our share repurchase program through April 2020, which provides continued flexibility to strategically repurchase shares at attractive levels should the opportunity materialize. We currently have approximately 264 million available under the program, which may be used on an opportunistic basis after our leverage is below four times. I'll now turn over the call to Frank for closing remarks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Wendy. Another important topic I would like to touch on is the issuance of our 2016 environmental report. As diligent and active custodians of protecting the world's natural resources, including the very oceans on which we make our living, our inaugural report focuses on corporate environmental practices and showcases our programs and initiatives in this critical area, including our newly launched Sail and Sustain program which articulates our mission to continually improve our sustainability culture through innovation, education, and collaboration. Looking beyond 2017, we have an upcoming ship introduction that will make 2018 another exciting and rewarding year. As mentioned earlier, the Norwegian Cruise Line brand will launch Norwegian Bliss in late spring 2018 in the Alaska market becoming the largest cruise ship to ever sail Alaska's pristine waters from our newly upgraded terminal in Seattle. Bliss's many first at sea feature innovations, some of which will first debut on Norwegian Joy, are resonating extremely well with travel agents and consumers. Bookings have been extremely strong, making her now the best-booked ship in the Norwegian Cruise Line fleet at this time for 2018. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, our booking window expanded approximately 25% versus same time last year, to what I believe is now close to the optimal balance between load and pricing. And this should enable us to maximize yields with 2018 fully benefiting from the demand we are seeing across our three brands from all source markets. And finally, I would just like to say a few words about how honored I am to lead this amazing organization, that has now grown to 25 ships across three award winning brands. Throughout the years, this company has pioneered many firsts in the cruise industry, and today with seven ships on order, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has further solidified its growth trajectory over the next eight years in this $50 billion industry. Our tremendous growth would not be possible without the countless contributions of our 30,000-plus hard-working team members. Our incredible ship board staff and crew, our shore side employees are dedicated to providing our guests with a truly exceptional vacation experience and I sincerely thank each and every one of them for their many contributions. As we progress through our 50th year of operation, I am confident we are well positioned for another record-breaking year, and we look forward to updating you all on our continued success in August. And with that, I'll turn over the call to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, and thank you. Frank, in the color in your prepared remarks for the second half stated that pricing for new bookings will moderately exceed prior year levels, but if we're doing our math right, your guidance for the second half seems to imply a slight reduction to net yields relative to where consensus is now. So I'm just wondering is that because some of that has to do with what was booked previously, so I'm wondering if you could just talk holistically about what you are seeing in the second half, ex-China, and then maybe how much China is offsetting that. Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Thank you, Felicia, and good morning. The velocity and the quality of bookings that we have seen throughout the year thus far, I commented on what we've seen the last 16 weeks, has been very, very \u2013 very, very strong, across all destinations from our North American channels, from our international channels. So the outlook and the actual bookings have been very strong, especially on the pricing side. If you recall last year, pricing began to slide, and it slid throughout a good portion of the year, before recovering late. And so all those factors are contributing to a very \u2013 a very good platform to raise prices across all destinations. As you know, we are now better booked versus same time last year for the first half \u2013 not only better booked but at mid-single digits up in pricing, and for the full year, we're also up, both in load and in pricing. The second half, we believe that given the trends that we're seeing, if they continue, we will likely surpass last year's pricing levels, and that's why this statement is made. As to your point as to the implied guidance, then is flat for the second half, that has quite a bit to do with the built-in conservative nature of our overall outlook, that includes the South Korea situation and China. We believe we're taking a very appropriate, conservative approach, perhaps more conservative today than we would be under the same circumstances a quarter from now, certainly a year from now, simply because, as you know, we have yet to operate our first sailing in China, and therefore, our history is, you know, literally non-existent, and we want to be appropriately conservative with our overall guidance. So to wrap up, our 24 ships ex-China are doing fantastic. Very, very happy with their performance, and we're being cautious with what's happening in China. As I said earlier, Joy had been booking tremendously well, and even though there has been a significant slowdown since early March in new charter contracts, where we stand right now on her charter contract business compared to the rest of the Norwegian fleet, Joy is still outperforming. But, again, because of our limited history in China, we are being conservative in our overall outlook. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And I would just add as a reminder that for Q3 we're also rolling over the Getaway Rio charter from last year that garnered very high yields, as well as the Explorer inaugural launch, which again, significantly benefited us in both Q3 and Q4 last year. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So just maybe to paraphrase, if we \u2013 if it was possible to kind of lift China out of your forecasts, would you see the second half yields as growing versus being flat year-over-year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, potentially if things continued to perform as they have been performing over the last 16 weeks or so, I would say that's a fair statement. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then as my follow-on, I just wanted to kind of pull back the layers a little bit more on China. So, you know, there was this travel ban to South Korea, and I think we all know just from listening to a lot of things coming out from other companies, that, you know, there is a bit of \u2013 kind of a disruption, right, in general. Now your big slowdown in new charter contracts, I'm just trying to understand that a little bit more. Because I think from how we all understand it, you know, there was obviously \u2013 you know, you had travel agents kind of booking South Korea, and then they had to stop, and so that created disruption, but I think a lot of us understand that there's now been more stability. So, what has been driving this big slow down in new charter contracts per se? Like, why is this South Korea travel ban affecting that so much? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well a couple of things. One, the disruption caused travel agents to be distracted from focusing on contracting charters further out into the year, then trying to book, in some cases re-book, find new customers who no longer wanted to go on sailings that didn't include Korea. But it's also \u2013 had a bit of a chilling effect on overall demand. You know, again, we don't have history of our first sailing is not until June 28, so still some seven weeks away, and as you know, it's a very close-in booking environment, where more than half the bookings occur, inside 30 days or so. But certainly, the events related to South Korea have had an impact on the overall business in China. And given, again, our limited history there, and being the new guys in town, so to speak, we've been very, very cautious in our outlook for China, and that's been included in our guidance. So in many ways, all the good things that I have to say about how our business is operating on the other 24 ships is being somewhat tempered by the potential that could arise in China. Not saying that it will, but I think it would be, you know, prudent of us, given our limited history there to be cautious about how the situation in China evolves. Good news yesterday that the South Korean elections bode better for, perhaps, solving this issue, than had another candidate won, so we're hopeful that the South Korea situation corrects itself sooner than later. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I just have a quick final one on D&A, Wendy, just housekeeping really. Your D&A came in higher in the quarter than your expectations, so I was just wondering what was driving that. And as we're thinking about D&A for next year, we're calculating roughly a 15% increase in 2018 over 2017 for D&A. Does that make sense? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, so one of the items that I would just caution everybody on is it's definitely best to model out your D&A not growing it as a percentage of sales, but instead taking into account the new ships as they come online. So when we get into 2018, there's going to be a step up in D&A because we are going to have a half year of Norwegian Joy as well as a half year of Norwegian Bliss. And on top of that, then there will be roughly $250 million in maintenance CapEx, that I would say on average I would use a seven-year life to depreciate that over. So when you adjust for the amortization of the customer relationships of approximately $26 million, in 2018, the adjusted D&A is expected to be up approximately 18%. And as a follow-on, on that, too, I would just also say that make sure that you are also keeping up with the interest expense because as you bring in these new ship additions, the interest expense also steps up in a similar way. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, and why was it higher in the quarter than your previous expectations? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, I think it was just timing, Felicia. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. Timing. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Good morning, everyone. Wanted to shift gears briefly to Europe. Can you give us a sense of how much capacity in the second quarter and third quarter is left to sell in Europe? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We're not going to comment on individual ships or individual regions, Harry, but I will tell you it is a lot less than this time last year. We have sold a lot more, so therefore, there is a lot less inventory. In many ways, I wish I had more inventory to sell, because we're getting very good prices on it. So we believe it's a combination of less inventory at this point in time versus last year and the very positive market conditions that we commented on, is resulting in very, very strong sales in Europe at significantly higher prices than same time last year. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : I guess where I was going with this, Frank, is is there enough in this inventory left to sell in the second and third quarters to move the yield needle for the year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: You know, I think, we have given you a fair representation of what we believe the final yield growth number is. We raised yield \u2013 net yield growth a full point, and as I said earlier, all the good things that we're seeing across our markets, Europe \u2013 you know, leading the way. Again, we're being cautious against what could be the case in China. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. And the other question I wanted to ask about China, is I was with one of your \u2013 the other brands last week, and their sense in China was that now that the itineraries have been reset that the customer demand has been picking back up over the past maybe three weeks or four weeks. Have you seen the same thing? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, again, it's a very close-in booking environment, Harry. As I said earlier our first sailing on June 28th is a full seven weeks away. Where we sit right now with the first handful of sailings, of which some bookings from the end user should be on it, are consistent with our expectations. It does, nevertheless, concern us that there was this slowdown for a six-week period of new charter contracts. As you know, it's a two-step process in China, the charter contract with the travel agents and then they in turn market it to the end user. We have seen a slight pickup in the last two weeks, perhaps consistent with the other comments you heard from our peers on the charter contract side. And so that was helpful. And again, I'll remind you that even though there was this significant slowdown, she is still better booked by a significant margin compared to the rest of the Norwegian fleet for the second half of the year. And the contracts that we have signed, and continue to sign, are still at price points that are consistent with our expectation of a 20% premium to the rest of the Norwegian fleet. Nevertheless, which has happened in China, and our limited experience there, we think it's prudent to be appropriately conservative. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Very good. Thanks. Thanks, Frank. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thanks, Harry. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Savino with Morgan Stanley. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, you talked about improving the quality of your international customers, just wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on that. What are you doing differently, and what's really driving that improved customer mix? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, that's a good question. As you know last year, demand from North American consumers slowed a bit because of the geopolitical events and one had to source more business internationally. If anything, it forced us to accelerate a little bit (35:06) perhaps we otherwise would have \u2013 our marketing, our penetration, in some of these international markets. I think it's paid off, and so the combination of a strong North American consumer, that is buying more of the available inventory, combined with those in-roads that we made last year, has allowed us to raise prices in international markets, and so we did so. What was surprising to us in a very positive way was that not only were we getting higher prices, but we were also getting higher loads. It's part of the booking curve. Not only are Americans \u2013 North Americans booking further out, but international guests are also booking further out. So today we've reached a point where we're pretty much indifferent where the booking comes from, whether it's a North American base or international base, and that's a very good place to be. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then just wondering if you maybe could give us a little bit more color on trends you are seeing within, you know, your premium and luxury brands. I think last quarter you had mentioned that pricing for those brands was still tracking down. So wondering if that's still the case, or if you have seen an improvement there? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, I think you heard me say before, if I had to grade the three brands last year, the Norwegian brand performed best, and the up-scale brands performed worst. Typical situation when you have geopolitical events and you rely on the North American consumer as these two brands do. The good news is that the turnaround story for us in 2017 is the performance of the up-scale brands. Their pricing has been stronger compared to last year, and so the pricing gap that existed early in the year is now narrowing where we expect both brands to outperform on a full-year basis, their pricing. And on a load-factor basis, both brands are performing very, very well, significantly outpacing the new bookings and therefore the full-year load for 2017 and I dare say also into 2018. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. So if I can go back to China real quick, and I think \u2013 you know, maybe a better way to ask about that market right now, is maybe, can you help us think about what's embedded in your guidance for China yields in the second half of the year? Meaning, are you basically maintaining what you've been witnessing for the last month or so? Or do you have yields decelerating from, you know, from where they were a couple months ago. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Steve, we don't provide guidance by individual markets or by individual ships, and obviously, China is a single-source market, enjoys the single-source market shift, so we're not going to go into a whole lot of detail. But look we have taken into account what we're seeing in China. My guess is perhaps we are being more conservative than our peers would have been, or perhaps more conservative than we ourselves will be, once we have some history under our belts. But this is a start-up market for us to begin with. We don't have any history there. It's a very different market. It's a very opaque market. We've heard throughout different industries that China is an opaque marketplace, and it's opaque in the cruise industry compared to what we're used to in the Western world. And so those situations concern us, and I think, we've reacted appropriately \u2013 appropriately conservative to reflect that in our full-year guidance, which as you know, is all in the back half of China. So, again, feel very, very good about the other 24 ships, across all markets, all brands, all source channels. China is a concern, primarily because of our lack of history. So we'll see if it continues to improve. As I said, there has been a little bit of a thaw, if you will, in the case of new charter contracts. We're now just entering for the first sailing, perhaps the first two or three sailings in early July the sweet spot of the booking curve. And so, again, we'll have much more experience under our belts once we talk to you again in August. We'll have a full six weeks of China history under our belts when we talk to you again next August. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for that color, Frank. And then second question would be just around the Alibaba agreement. I know you touched on it a little bit at the beginning of your prepared remarks, but could you give us a little bit more color on how this agreement came together. And then I guess the question is, do you think this relationship could possibly jeopardize some of your relationships with your distributors in that market as you try to go through and grow your brand? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No, not at all. I think that the relationship that we're going to have with Alibaba will improve the exposure of Norwegian Cruise Line as a brand. We'll expose cruising as a vacation alternative to China. I mean, Alibaba is huge in China. Unless you know it well, there is nothing in the U.S. that compares to it. Couple little statistics. I'm told that Amazon controls 14% of the United States e-commerce. Alibaba controls 83% of China's e-commerce. So any time you can forge a partnership with someone with an entity that has that kind of reach, that has the kind of database as to the needs, wants, psyche of Chinese consumers, I think, it's a very positive thing. Our travel agents already sell cruises on Alibaba, and we think that our partnership with Alibaba will enhance their ability to sell more inventory, our inventory, to not just any guests, but very targeted guests who are likely to pay more to go on a cruise, and that's where their incredible database and knowledge of the consumer in China comes into play. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Frank. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. I wanted to clarify just one or two things when you were talking about your booked position. In your opening comments, you mentioned that you were significantly booked versus the prior year, including and excluding Joy, and then you said pricing up mid-single digits, was that including or excluding Joy? And if it's one of them, I guess I would ask what is the other, just to get a sense of the scene in the way you performed. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, the number wouldn't change a whole lot including or excluding Joy, because Joy is coming in pretty much at the corporate average. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then I guess I'm trying to parse what it means for your implied guidance for the second half, and I think, you \u2013 it sounded like you were saying that if things continue the way they have the last 16 weeks that the second half maybe could be better than flat. So I guess it sounds like \u2013 I guess, it's Q2 where a lot of the pricing is up year-over-year, and maybe in the second half kind of what's on the book today isn't? Just trying to understand that. And also it seems like Q4 you are comping against \u2013 you had negative yields last year, and I think it was the Caribbean that was a lot of that. So I mean, is it fair to say that at least what's on the books for Q4 today is higher year-over-year? So is it really just a Q3 issue at this point? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, that was a mouthful, Robin. I'll try to remember. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Try to triangulate, yeah. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And I'll try to go in sequential order by quarter. Quarter 2 is substantially sold. There's very, very little inventory left to sell in quarter 2. So we feel very, very good about our guidance that we provided you, where year-over-year net yield growth is a healthy 5.5%, and that's being driven by primarily three things, Explorer. We didn't have Explorer last year, we only had Sirena for half the quarter, and Cuba. We will operate 11 sailings in Cuba in Q2, and as I said earlier, the performance of that itinerary is just astonishing. Q3, as we all know Q3 is the big Europe quarter, and you have to understand the booking curve. A quarter doesn't fill the quarter before or two quarters before. It starts 15 months, 18 months before. So we are lapping \u2013 have begun to lap \u2013 we have not fully lapped the effects of last year's decrease in pricing. There is a modest amount of inventory left to sell in Q3 and into Europe as well. A lot less than there was to sell this time last year. So from this time forward last year, because there was more inventory to sell last year, and prices were dropping, we're going to start \u2013 and we have already started to close the gap between where pricing was at this time last year for Q3 and where it ended. So we believe that when it's all said and done, Q3 pricing has a good chance of moderately exceeding last year's performance, and I'll say the same in general for Q4. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : If Q4 is more of a Caribbean quarter than a Europe quarter, though, would your \u2013 because it wouldn't have been the same sort of security lapping issues. Your pricing today for Q4 is higher year-over-year, is that fair to say? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, last year we had Explorer and Sirena in Q4, a very, very high yielding product that we're now lapping. So that's no longer a catalyst for yield growth. But I think, the takeaway is that business is very, very strong, both in load and in the pricing of business that we're adding to our booked position throughout the quarter \u2013 future quarters, certainly for the rest of 2017, and into 2018. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : And then just another question on expenses if possible. (47:17) The full year expense has gone up, it looks like by more than just the extra expense in Q1. So I don't know if you \u2013 I know you talked about some of the factors driving Q1 expense higher. Do you have a little color on the full year? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Sure. So there is some additional costs that we have added in for the full year. It's primarily related to additional marketing that we're putting into China, based on the South Korea travel restrictions. Also we're deploying additional marketing for all of our Cuba sailings to really try to seal and maintain those extremely high premiums that Frank mentioned. That's the majority of it, and then I already had mentioned some of the costs that we incurred in Q1 related to the Norwegian Star. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, in terms of Cuba, it is also important to note that we now have 41 sailings in 2017, represents about 1.8% of our full-year capacity. For 2018, we now have 56 sailings for 2018 that we want to market. It's always best to load early and get the highest prices possible, and those 56 sailings will make up 2.1% of our full-year capacity. So while, you know, roughly 2% of capacity is not, you know, significant, given the pricing premiums that could be had, based on what we have seen, that \u2013 of actuals in \u2013 for the quarter 2 sailings that we actually have either sailed or have substantially sold out at this point, it's important that we do all our best to promote that destination \u2013 it is a new destination \u2013 to garner the highest prices possible. I think, it will pay dividends down the road. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And then just as a housekeeping issue, following up on your prior question, Robin, I just wanted to mention too that for the back half of the year, when you look at the break-out between Q3 and Q4, Q3 definitely will be the lowest quarter. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. We'll just stay on China and Korea here if you don't mind, and we appreciate all the color so far. And Frank fully appreciate the -- again, as you said several times, you don't have a history there yet. So just to confirm what you said \u2013 given what you have seen in the last couple of weeks. One, do you believe we've passed the inflection point of some of the competitors, as implied with the South Korea, China issue? And then those last two weeks, is that already factored into your guidance here at this point? Or is two weeks does not a trend make? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, two weeks does not a trend make. I'd like to see it continue, Tim, quite frankly, and I'd like to see the pace of new groups, new charters, new half charter contracts accelerate a bit. But at least it broke the ice. For a good six weeks there was nothing, and now there is something, and that gives us hope that there will be more. As to the commentary of the others, again the others were involved in trying to fill sailings that were departing in late March, April and May, that would have had the brunt of the South Korean restrictions. Ours luckily doesn't start until late June, June 28. As I said earlier, the sweet spot of the booking curve has not yet really begun for that sailing, much less the ones in July and August. So it's too early for us to tell, and again, because of our lack of history there, we are being cautious \u2013 we're cautiously optimistic. But nevertheless, we think it would be prudent to have that level of conservatism, and that level of conservatism is reflected in our full-year guidance. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, okay. And from a math perspective, I guess, some of the concerns here today have just been the flow-through, and I think you guys have fleshed that through fairly well here. But the point higher in yield we're roughly seeing only 25% of that flow through, and again, we can contribute all that \u2013 basically attribute it to the South Korea marketing, pricing assistance, however you want to frame that, and then the additional Cuba. Anyway to parse between those two buckets that differential? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I think it simply reflects our caution. We're cautiously optimistic. If things in the rest of the world, or the environment continues to be as robust as it is today, I think that bodes well for the second half. And the key for us will be China. We have a greater degree of confidence in the other markets \u2013 the markets where the other 24 ships operate, because we know those markets. We don't know China. And although Norwegian Joy only represents 8% of our capacity, we think it's prudent to be cautious. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then one last one on Europe, clearly, that was problematic as we all well know, and that's turning, thankfully here, with the North Americans coming. If we look at history here, just remind us where historically how much of your European itineraries were sourced from North America, what it was last year, and now as it is recovering? Plus you add the Getaway, which is obviously a larger ship, how that is looking at 2017 and any color for 2018? How you anticipate the mix of North Americans throughout those periods looking for European itineraries? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, as I said earlier, we're very pleased that we've now achieved pricing parity between North Americans and the rest of the world. So now it's \u2013 and I think that parity and the strength in the overall markets is leading our ability to stretch that booking curve into throughout 2017 and throughout 2018. It gets a better quality customer on board, which helps on on-board revenue and we're seeing strong on-board revenue, we saw it in Q1. So in terms of the math on that, we have seen roughly a 13% decrease in the number of Europeans that have booked European sailings for 2017 versus 2016. And that decrease has been made up, not only by North Americans, but by other international-sourced markets that are doing very well for us, especially Australia, Brazil, and non-China Asia have really stepped up. So we now have a more diversified portfolio, if you will, of channels by which we can tap to maximize our revenue, and we're seeing it. We're seeing it, like I said, across all three brands, across all the destinations that we cruise to, and from a variety of sources. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you, Frank. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Elizabeth, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning, everybody. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: How are you? Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Good, thanks. Maybe I can ask this a little bit differently. Can you tell us the percentage of the second half that's booked right now, and at what prices? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I will tell you that our load factor is up mid single-digits, and our pricing overall is flat, but gaining ground every week as we begin to lap the decrease in prices last year. Now that's the book position. The velocity of bookings, the quality of bookings over the last 16-week period, pricing is up solid double-digits, where the overall load factor is down single-digits, primarily because we have less inventory to sell. You can't continue to have this huge gap in loads. At some point the curve of time and inventory merges, and that's what we're seeing. But as you have less inventory to sell, you raise prices, and the demand of that inventory pushes further out and that's why 2018, even though, very early, is shaping up so well. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And, just to understand this a little bit better. Are you saying that second half, 3Q and 4Q, the booked position, the pricing is flat, or are you saying 2Q through the end of 4Q? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I think you asked me about second half. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I answered second half. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So I guess I'm just trying to understand this is a little bit better. If second-half pricing is flat right now, but the new bookings you are getting up double-digits, that would imply second half pricing and yields are going to be up, but that gap is just the conservatism for the Joy and China? Is that a fair way to think about it? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes, but remember that there is a lot less inventory to sell, and so, if I had a lot of inventory to sell at high prices then I think I know where you are going with the implication. But just keep in mind, that we have considerably less inventory to sell than we did this time last year, and therefore the potential impact on full-year net yield growth is somewhat limited. And it is also somewhat being limited by our own guidance, because of the uncertainty in China. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Okay. And if I could just ask one last one. Are you committed to keeping Joy in China year-round or will you consider redeploying to the southern hemisphere during the winter season, maybe in Australia or another market? We have seen that from some of your competitors, so just curious how you're thinking about that. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Right now we're committed to keeping Joy in China. I'm glad to see that the others are leaving. That leaves us perhaps the last man standing, and that'd be great. I'll take all the demand. But, look, ships have propellers and rudders for a reason, and our goal is to always deploy them in areas that we think can maximize profitability. Today we think that place is China. The South Korea situation, we believe, is a temporary bump in the road, and time will tell. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thanks very much, everyone, for your time and support this morning. And as always we'll be available to answer your questions later on today. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Leanne and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Beck, please proceed. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Leanne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary after which I will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide guidance for 2017 before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2017 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter of 2017 the stars aligned just right as we took each of our three leading cruise brands and their award-winning 25-ship fleet to new heights. The booking environment was as strong as any we've witnessed in recent history and was aided by a confident consumer that was willing to spend more than ever before on onboard activities to enhance their vacation experience. The strong booking environment was coupled with deployment initiatives undertaken to optimize deals plus existing itineraries were enhanced with the addition of new destinations that garnered double-digit yield premiums. Lastly, we benefited from the sustained benefits that come with a comprehensive fleet wide revitalization program that ensures that the industry's youngest fleet remains fresh and relevant. The outcome was a quarter where all the factors I just mentioned coalesced to produce strong record results including a record adjusted net yield growth that allowed us to confidently raise our earnings per share and yield growth expectations for the remainder of 2017. The extraordinarily strong booking environment which we have experienced and have been discussing in our most recent call continues to thrive. To use a nautical phrase, this rising tide is lifting boats throughout the industry. At Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, however, we have leveraged and fine-tuned our unique revenue optimization strategies of providing value pack offerings early in the booking cycle to build solid loads at healthy per diem. We also deployed the marketing support needed to fill whatever close-in inventory remained in order to avoid price erosion late in the booking cycle and thus ensure maximum yield growth. The result was a yield performance that exceeded our expectations and further solidified our position as the cruise operator with the highest absolute net yield in the industry. The robust booking environment is benefiting from near-high positive consumer sentiment, especially from our broad North American consumer base. Not only is the result a consumer willing to pay more for their cruise fare, but also a consumer willing to spend more for onboard experiences such as short excursions and other experiential activities. This behavior is also encouraged by our revenue optimization strategy where the inclusion of value-added onboard offerings as part of the ticket price through programs like Norwegian brand's Free at Sea and Regent's all-inclusive fares mean that guests have had time to replenish their wallets between booking and sailing dates resulting in increased overall onboard spend. This onboard spend phenomena has taken hold not just from North American sourced consumers. Our value-added strategy of adding more offerings into the ticket price, particularly for the Norwegian brand, has also proven successful in European sourced markets to the point where the sum of ticket pricing and onboard spend gap has narrowed so that we are agnostic as to whether bookings originate from North America or from international markets. The quarter also benefited both from our deployment optimization initiatives as well as the inclusion of new destinations to our itinerary portfolio. An example of the former is Norwegian Getaway's redeployment to the Baltic region beginning early in the summer season. This redeployment of the formerly year-round Miami-based ship allows us to take advantage of significantly higher per diems in peak summer Europe compared to low season summer Caribbean. The move also bolstered pricing for Norwegian Escape in the second and third quarters, as she is now our sole Miami-based Caribbean mega ship during the summer, running alternating Eastern and Western Caribbean itineraries. The latter of these itineraries includes calls to the region's newest purpose-built destination, our Harvest Caye resort in Belize. As I stated earlier, sailings to new destinations benefited the quarter and Harvest Caye continues to be one of our highest rated destinations in our entire portfolio of over 500 ports of call, but in terms of benefiting the quarter, no new destination has had quite the impact of Cuba. Our voyages to Havana have been a home run since we began sailing on Oceania Cruises in March of this year. The second quarter particularly benefited from 11 sailings to Havana. Included in these initial sailings were nine four-night sailings onboard Norwegian Sky, which garnered very healthy ticket price premiums, compared to Norwegian Sky's former four-night Bahamas-only itinerary. And while early on, we were unsure as to whether these pricing premiums would endure; subsequent sailings in Q2 and beyond have continued to gain meaningful premiums which we now believe are sustainable given the limited capacity to call on Cuban ports and the low likelihood of any near-term infrastructure improvements in Havana. The success of Norwegian Sky voyages to Havana has prompted the Norwegian brand to add a second ship to regularly call on this historic city. So beginning in May of 2018, Norwegian Sun will begin sailing four-day itineraries to Havana from Port Canaveral. In addition, demand is extraordinarily strong for Oceania Cruises sailings to the island in 2017 and in 2018. All in, 2018 capacity that includes calls to Cuba is double that of 2017, now reaching approximately 4% of our deployment mix. Performance in the quarter also benefited from investments in our Fleet Enhancement Program, particularly the Norwegian brand's Norwegian Edge. The enhancements tied to the program have facilitated our ability to charge higher ticket prices and further boost onboard revenue. These enhancements make the contemporary space's youngest fleet even more desirable with a core quality of offerings that is more consistent from our smallest to our largest new vessels. Looking ahead, and while I may sound a bit repetitive from our commentary last quarter, the momentum from the strong demand trends that we have experienced over the last several quarters continues to have a positive impact across our brands, across deployments and across quarters. I had mentioned in our prior call that we expected pricing for second half 2017 sailings to begin to surpass last year's levels as strong demand was driving improved pricing for remaining inventory. This expectation has come to fruition and pricing for sailings in the second half is now up mid-single digits. In addition, the second half of 2017 is so well-booked that the dearth of inventory left to sell has resulted in the vast majority of the strong booking momentum shifting to 2018 sailings. This pivot is true for all three brands, which are now well ahead in load and pricing versus same time last year. There was one seminal event late in the second quarter that while it did not impact results for the quarter itself, marked an important milestone in our globalization and diversification strategy. That event, of course, was the launch of our China-based ship, Norwegian Joy, in Shanghai. While her first revenue cruise was not until June 28, the period prior to her launch was dedicated to familiarizing her unique offerings to travel agents and the Chinese cruising public. By the time Norwegian Joy arrived to her new home port of Shanghai for her christening, she had already received a flurry of media coverage, resulting in an incredible 5 billion impressions. The number of impressions doubled to 10 billion as a result of extensive media coverage from her inaugural and christening activities headlined by her Godfather and China's King of Pop, Leehom Wang. This media coverage complemented the year-long marketing campaign we launched to introduce Norwegian Joy as a first-class at sea experience to the Chinese cruising public. From television commercials to billboards to an e-commerce based sweepstake with our marketing partners at Alibaba that attracted nearly 1 million participants, we started from scratch and built the foundation for a solid brand backed by premium hardware. Norwegian Joy's launch, however, came on the heels of travel restrictions to South Korea. The resulting uncertainty surrounding itinerary deployment, coupled with our lack of operating history in China, caused us to perhaps be overly conservative and cautious in our last earnings call. Fortunately, during the first six weeks of operation, Joy's performance has been slightly better than what was included in the estimate embedded in our prior guidance. Cruise pricing for future voyages appear to have stabilized and load factors for voyages in the last six weeks have been some of the highest we have ever experienced. We look to build on this momentum with the hopeful return of sailings to South Korea at some point in the near future. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy to go over our excellent results for the quarter and revised upward guidance for the remainder of the year in more detail. Wendy, please. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2017 and 2016 adjusted net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our second quarter results, followed by color on booking trends and then we'll close with our outlook and guidance for third quarter and full year 2017. The second quarter of 2017 marks the latest in a series of record-setting quarters for the company. Both revenue and earnings were the highest in our history for Q2 and we reached our 36th consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA growth. Results for the quarter came in well ahead of expectations, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.02, above guidance of approximately $0.95. Adjusted net yield increased a record 8.1% or 7.2% on an as reported basis versus the prior year, outperforming guidance expectations of up 5.5% driven by strong close-in demand coupled with strengths in onboard revenue. Looking at cost, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel was in line with guidance increasing 2.7% or 2.6% on an as-reported basis versus the prior year due to an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower cruise operating expenses. Turning to fuel, our fuel expense per metric ton net of hedges was $469, which was flat to prior year but unfavorable versus our guidance. The increase in our fuel price per metric ton compared to guidance was primary due to changes in our expected mix as we consumed more MGO than anticipated during the ramp-up to full utilization of our exhaust gas scrubber technology that is expected to become fully operational in the second half of this year. Taking a look below the line interest expense net decreased to $64.2 million compared to $68.4 million in the prior year. Interest expense for 2017 reflects an increase in average debt balances outstanding, primarily associated with the delivery of new ships and newbuild installments as well as higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR. Interest expense for 2016 included a write-off of $11.4 million of deferred financing fees related to the refinancing of certain of our credit facilities in 2016. Turning to the third quarter, capacity is increasing approximately 9%, primarily due to the addition of Norwegian Joy to our fleet. As for our deployment mix, approximately 40% is allocated to Europe, up from 37% in the prior year, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Getaway to the region. The Caribbean represents approximately 16% of our deployment mix in the third quarter, down from 22% in the prior year, mainly due to the aforementioned repositioning of Norwegian Getaway to the Baltic region. The Asia Africa Pacific region has become a sizable share of our global deployment mix and now accounts for approximately 8% of our deployment with the introduction of Norwegian Joy to the Chinese market in the third quarter. As for other key markets, Alaska accounts for 16%, Bermuda 11% and Hawaii 4% of our deployment mix. Before I walk you through our guidance and expectations for the third quarter and full year 2017, I'd like to remind you about some key drivers benefiting our sizable yield growth in the first half of the year versus the back half. The first half of the year benefited from the addition of Regent Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Sirena in the fleet, which garnered much higher yields than the blended NCLH corporate average; while in the back half of the year we lapped their entry into the fleet. Now focusing on the third quarter, as a result of higher ticket prices from the robust booking environment, we expect revenue to come in stronger than originally anticipated. Adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.75% or 2% on an as-reported basis, even in light of the following factors : first we are up against tougher pricing comparisons in the third quarter as we are lapping both the premium priced 40-day charter of Norwegian Getaway for the Rio Olympics and the introduction of Seven Seas Explorer, which entered the fleet in the peak summer season after experiencing record early bookings at the higher prices typical of inaugural season. Second, Norwegian Joy entered the fleet just prior to the beginning of the third quarter. As we previously discussed, due to the mix of our portfolio of brands, when any Norwegian Cruise Line ship joints our fleet, their yields are lower than the blended NCLH corporate average which inherently impacts our corporate yield growth. Excluding the aforementioned factors, our third quarter net yield guidance on a like-for-like basis would have been in excess of 5% compared to our guidance of up 1.75%. That said I want to reiterate that these mega ships are highly accretive to both revenue and earnings. Now turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be slightly up on both a constant currency and as-reported basis. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $455, with expected consumption of approximately 195,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the third quarter is expected to be approximately $1.83. Turning to the full year, as Frank mentioned in his opening remarks, the booking environment has remained extremely strong. Strength in all core markets across all our brands have resulted in the raising of our outlook for adjusted net yield by 150 basis points, which is now expected to be approximately 4.25% or 4% on an as reported basis. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is now expected to be up approximately 25 basis points to 1.75% on both a constant currency and as reported basis. The approximately $5 million increase in the cost guidance is primarily attributable to the costs associated with higher than anticipated load factors, and incremental startup costs for Norwegian Joy as she entered service in the Chinese market. Looking at fuel expense, our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges is now expected to be $456 with expected consumption of approximately 785,000 metric tons. The increase in price is primarily the result of the impact of rising fuel prices since our last earnings call, as well is the previously mentioned changes in our expected consumption mix. As a result of our strong second quarter performance, and a continued robust booking environment that we believe will positively impact our next two quarters, we have raised our full-year guidance of adjusted earnings per share by $0.14 to a range of $3.93 to $4.03 which surpasses the high end of our prior full your guidance range. Of the guidance increase of $0.14, $0.07 is due to outperformance in the second quarter, and approximately $0.18 is due to the outperformance we anticipate earning during the remainder of the year, driven by stronger than previously expected yield growth, partially offset by $0.05 of expense due to higher fuel costs, $0.02 due to the increase in net cruise cost x-fuel attributable to our recently launched China operations, and the balance is due to an increased tax provision as a result of the improved performance of our U.S. based operations, and a slight change to our interest in depreciation expense. With that, I'll now turn the call to Frank for closing remarks. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Wendy. As I had mentioned in my earlier commentary, the same strong overall business environment that has benefited 2017 has permeated well into 2018. And no ship has benefited as much from this pivot as the first purpose built ship for Alaska Sailings, Norwegian Bliss, which we will welcome to our fleet in May of 2018. Today her book position in terms of cabins sold is at a level that took the next best booked breakaway newbuild an additional 10 weeks of sales to reach. In terms of pricing, she recently exceeded that of the previously best priced breakaway newbuild at this point prior to sailing. We fully expect Bliss' strong performance to continue to climb, and indeed be boosted by the marketing initiatives and media coverage surrounding our upcoming announcement of Norwegian Bliss' cutting-edge features and offerings. I look forward to updating everyone on these announcements as well as our results and other updates next quarter. But for now, I'll turn the call to Leanne to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the questions. Frank, Wendy I know your overall net yield growth is impacted by your fleet mix. So, is there any color you can provide on how each of your brands did in 2Q just relative to your overall system net yield growth of the 7.2%? And maybe how you're thinking about that in the back half of the year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We don't comment on individual brands, but I can tell you that all brands contributed to the beat. As I mentioned earlier, high tide raises all boats, raises all brands and that is certainly true for our three brands. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And Andrew I would just add that when you look at our second quarter net yield growth on a like-for-like basis, it's roughly 5% of the 8.1% like-for-like, and then we have the benefit of the Explorer and the Sirena. Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for that, Wendy. And then just my follow-up question, Wendy, you mentioned just slightly higher interest expense as LIBOR and your principal balances creep up. How are you thinking about leverage here? On our numbers, we can see you can delever about half a turn per year with your growth and some cash build. Would you want to delever quicker as maybe interest rates come up? Or are rates just still too attractive to allocate capital to debt reduction now? Thanks. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good question. It's about a half a turn on an annual basis if we just naturally are deleveraging, and we're always looking at what's the next move to improve the balance sheet? As a reminder, we've said that we want to delever down into the three to four times range, probably preferably down to the lower end of that. Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Frank, last time I called a ship a boat and I almost got executed, so. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Almost. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, first I wanted to, on the Joy. Obviously, it's been a nice surprise. I'm not sure if you're going to call out how much was responsible for anything in the quarter. But I'm really \u2013 if you can, that would be great. But I'm also really hoping you can talk more about what you're seeing on onboards there. I know you had high expectations, so I just wanted to know, kind of, if that has been even your high expectations and if the Joy has made you feel more confident about the ship addition in 2019. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good morning, Felicia. Onboard revenue at one time we expect it to be up to 20% higher than the average fleet. As you know, the Norwegian brand has the highest onboard yields of any of our competitors, so it was a high barrier to reach. The South Korea restrictions have affected both the ticket per diems and an onboard. And so, the outlook that we have that we had previously noted and certainly the revised one, that we revised upwards today does include what we're seeing in the onboard space. Having said that, we have certain initiatives underway that we believe will improve the onboard revenue generation like it would on any new vessel. This is not only a new vessel for us, but a new market, so we still have some opportunities to improve upon what we've already seen. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just to complete this question. Just talking about, does it make you feel more confident about 2019? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I think it's too early to talk about 2019. We're committed to the Chinese market. Obviously, there have been some bumps in the road the last year or so. We've seen what others have done in terms of deployment in the future. We're committed to being in this market, and like any market it will have ups and downs. Perhaps the Chinese market is a little more volatile than some of the other more mature ones, but we're committed to being in China in the long term. We clearly see the psychographic dynamics of that Chinese market where hundreds of millions of people travel outside of China every year. And we think that cruising is a fantastic value, not just for the Western world, but for Asians, as well, and we want to be a part of that. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then just moving on to the next question, my follow up. So, look, you gave us nice optimistic color on 2018 overall regarding loads and pricing. Previously you guys were trying to keep the investment committee tempered because of what new Norwegian branded ships do to the overall mix. But I'm just wondering, given the momentum that you're seeing, was that prior tempered view maybe too cautious and can we see a 2018 yield growth like we're seeing this year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: This year, as I mentioned in my opening sentence, all the stars aligned up very nicely and it would be difficult to predict another almost perfect year as we've seen this year. So, no, I wouldn't want you to model in the kind of yield growth that we're seeing this year for 2018. I think you would be overshooting quite a bit. Nevertheless, we do like the way 2018 is coming in. Business is strong. We're building loads very well at good pricing. So we like the way it's coming in. A bit early to really give you a definitive answer, but just historically it would be difficult to predict another year like 2017. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I would just add, Felicia that as I said in my commentary, that the first half of 2017 greatly benefited from the addition of the Regent Seven Seas Explorer as well as the Oceania Sirena. We don't have that same benefit in the second half of the year, and instead we're bringing in the Joy which will get a half-year benefit from in 2018 as well as a half-year benefit from the Norwegian Bliss, both of those being Norwegian ships as we've talked about, being below the NCLH average. So it's hard to achieve the same type of yield growth that we've just posted for Q2. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Good morning. Very good results. And just following up on the prior questions, to what degree did you \u2013 based on the \u2013 in Europe, kind of, oversell or more cautiously sell for the 2017 than usual? And in the sense that do you think it's had much of a drag on your yields this year, particularly in the second half? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi, Harry. Not as much in the second half because the drag that you talk about is simply the function of the booking curve. So remember, the business started to turn, in our view, sometime in mid- to really the late-Q3 period last year, and by that time we had a sizable amount of inventory sold for the 2017 Europe season, more so in the upscale brands that have a longer booking curve than the Norwegian brand. And as that turnaround took hold, and business continued to improve, and we gained confidence that that was sustainable, we continued to raise prices. But you can't take off the book, the lower-priced business that was already on. In fact, history tells you that as you raise prices, people are less apt to cancel those bookings because they got a deal. So, as we progress through the booking cycle and into each quarter, the effect of that weakness that we saw throughout 2016 in terms of bookings moderates. So that effect is greater in Q2 than in Q3, for example, and to some degree, to the degree that we have business in Europe in Q4, even less there. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : So thanks. And looking ahead, given this strong demand, what do you plan to do in 2018? Will you hold back more for 2018 in anticipation of better close-in bookings next year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: What do you mean hold back? You mean hold back inventory for sale? Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Yes. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: When demand is there, you take it, Harry, and you take it at higher pricing. And that's what we're seeing. So as I said in my commentary, we're well ahead across all three brands in both load and in pricing for 2018. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. And then my second question is related to just a little bit more color on the second half guidance versus where your booking and yield trends are. You talked about mid-single-digit yields, but your outlook is for 2% yield. And I'm just wondering, what are the offsets that we should be considering for the back half of this year? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Sure. Great question, so you really are alluding to it with how much was already booked. So if you look at the remaining category of cabins left to sell, it's primarily the Norwegian brand that's left for the back half of the year, and primarily even into Q4. And then even if you parse the types of cabins, it tends to be the lower categories of cabins that are booking close-in. So although we are thrilled with where we stand with the mid-single digits in pricing, there's not enough of the mix for the blended NCLH yield to materially move the numbers for Q3 and Q4. And then on top of it, as I've previously mentioned, Q3 we're further rolling over the Rio charter from last year as well as the inaugural season of the Explorer, oh, and Joy. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. That's helpful. Yes. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. One question I wanted to clarify, and I think, maybe, your comments did already, but just to clarify. In the release, you talked about the next four quarters having strong volume and firm pricing. And then you say the next two quarters have price and occupancy up mid-single digits. So, I wonder if you could just comment on the first two quarters of 2018, whether strong and firm, does that mean up for both of them, just looking at those first two quarters of 2018? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We're not going to talk about individual quarters in 2018. My commentary broadly said that as of now, for 2018, we're well ahead both in price and in load versus same time last year. And that is true for all three brands. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then one clarification, just looking at your CapEx for 2017, it looks like since last quarter it went up by, kind of, $250 million to $300 million. I know you had called out previously that Project Leonardo would be adding about $70 million in CapEx this year. What's the other kind of $200 million in CapEx since last quarter that you'll end up spending? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes, so great question. So it is bringing on the Joy. It's also The Norwegian Edge program, as that continues to roll out, and then as you mentioned, the Leonardo ships. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So the Joy or something with the Edge just ended up coming in a little higher in 2017? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes, and then a little bit of FX. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Let me maybe return to a question that was alluded to earlier. Frank, could you address the booking curve? The whole industry, as you said, is doing well; the stars aligned this year. Do you look to further expand or do you want to further expand the booking curve? Or is it sort of at the, in finance terms, the efficient frontier at this point? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes, that's something that we look at constantly, the trade-off of an incremental booking versus the outlook for future price increases. I'm one of the opinion that when demand is there, you take it and you take it and you keep pushing pricing until that demand hits a resistant point. And, so, the commentary I'll tell you is that throughout the last couple of quarters, certainly today, we're telling you that across the board, across markets, across brands, across periods, pricing is strong. The consumer is alive and well, especially the North American consumer is showing a lot of strength, certainly versus last year in Europe. And, as you know, that North American consumer is the best consumer; books the earliest, books the highest cabin categories and, once onboard, spends the most money. So today, our booking curve is at an all-time high, a little over seven months on average. And that is a significant improvement over where it was this time last year. Do I want to take it higher? I don't have any preconceived number in my mind that I want it to be eight months versus six months. Seven months is certainly where we are today and I'm very happy with it, and I'm also very happy with the per diems that, that booking curve is generating. One cannot look at one without the other. So today the business environment is strong and we're getting both load and price. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then any commentary from your perspective, Wendy, you gave some color I think on Q3. But looking into 2018 from an industry global capacity allocation, Europe, Alaska, North America, China, just \u2013 and some of the major regions, what you see from an industry perspective at this point. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Sure. So for 2018 total, we're anticipating for the industry that capacity will be up mid-single digits. That's the same for the Caribbean and Europe, both up mid-single digits and China being down mid-single digits. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, okay. And Alaska, Wendy? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I don't have Alaska. Yes, I'll have to follow up with you on that one, Tim. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: But our Alaska, obviously, capacity will increase nicely given the introduction of Norwegian Bliss. And as I mentioned earlier, her advanced bookings both in load and pricing are really impressive. So, we're eager to get our hands on her and deploy her to Alaska. Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Congrats, and thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, maybe you can help me understand the Cuba impact a little bit better. How much of your 4.25% yield growth guide is Cuba? Is it 50 basis points, 100 basis points? And since you're ramping Cuba further in 2018, could that contribution to yields increase further again next year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. Jared, we don't comment on region specific or ship specific yield, but I will tell you that Cuba is performing very well. I think I described it as a homerun. Certainly Cuba contributed to the yield beat both in Q2 and in \u2013 expected to be in Q3 then Q4. We believe that always looking at deployments that enhance our profit profile and moving the Norwegian Sun there in spring of 2018 will certainly do that. And given the inherent infrastructure limitations to Cuba, there is only so much capacity that can enter Cuba. So we're very fortunate that we've been able to maximize our presence in Cuba, in Havana in particular, and in doing so we've been able to increase our deployment there to be about 4% of our capacity from 2% in 2017. All three brands will call on Cuba with the Norwegian brand having the most impact of roughly 60 sailings, 59 to be exact for 2018. The Oceania brand will have 21 sailings. So again, I want to remind everyone that while looking at individual deployment and ship contributions certainly impact overall yield growth, the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings story is not a yield growth story because of the makeup, the unique makeup of our three brands in the categories that they're in. It is a revenue growth and more importantly an earnings growth story. So I urge everyone to focus on our drivers for earnings growth over the years to come and not so much on the yield growth necessarily. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, thanks. So let me follow up on that point then. If I look at your unit cost, they've been running around 1% to 2% annually which I know is in line with your long-term target as well, and I appreciate that you're not prepared to give any guidance on next year. But maybe can you just help us quantify the mix impact of bringing on Norwegian metal versus a normal year? And is negative unit cost growth for next year; is that in play at all? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. So we're not prepared to give you guidance on 2018 today. Clearly we do benefit as we bring on more of the \u2013 especially the large Norwegian ships. Our guidance has always been in that 1% to 2% range and all I would tell you is that there will be some benefit to bringing in the Bliss as well as the half year of the Joy. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. So, Wendy or Frank, I guess what's embedded for Joy for the rest of the year in your guidance? I know the last time we talked, you were talking about embedding a price or a yield drop through the rest of the year. So, maybe how you're thinking about joy now that you've been operating that for, call it, five or six weeks? Are you guys expecting pricing to remain flattish from where it is today or does it get slightly better or worse? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Again, Steve, we don't provide guidance by market or by specific ship. What we're seeing in the marketplace has already been embedded in our future guidance. As I stated earlier, we were pleasantly surprised that she's performed as well as she has versus our revised expectations during the first six weeks. We're about to enter in the, starting in September some time, the shoulder season, and the shoulder season is somewhat different than the peak summer season. So, do not expect pricing to increase in absolute terms in the shoulder season versus summer. How it will compare to prior seasons, we're not sure because we weren't there in prior seasons, but we think that our overall guidance for the company certainly takes a cautious look at what we expect out of Joy. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then the second question, I guess, a bigger question around Europe. But, Frank, it seems like that North American passenger is really starting to \u2013 willing to head back over to Europe, and again, that is your sweet spot over there. But, I guess, the question is, how do you guys balance your book of business now over there? Meaning, are you still trying to source more locals so you don't get impacted again if that market turns around, like what happened last year? Or are you still really trying to get as many North Americans onboard as possible? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: You might have missed my point earlier, but I've said that we now reached a point of parity where we're agnostic whether that consumer books from North America or from international markets. We've done certain things in our revenue management and our marketing and our product offerings that has de facto increased the per diem and also the onboard yields. So, today there is a very nice balance. We have increased our business in absolute terms with the introduction of Getaway in the European markets, but disproportionately more North Americans our booking our European itineraries than same time last year. Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question is from David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, there. Thanks for the question. You had some of the cost growth increase 25 basis points, and you explained that well, due to the load factor. But it's the second increase in as many quarters. Just a broader question, I guess, do you feel more comfortable increasing cost in a strong demand environment such as what we have today? Or would you have increased cost this year, sort of, regardless of the environment? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I think this was an unusual one this quarter. We've never had a ship in China, and so the 25 basis points which is approximately $5 million is totally related to the launch of the Norwegian Joy in China. To seat it, it was additional startup costs as well as the fact that we are experiencing record occupancies \u2013 the top record for all of Norwegian Cruise Line ever. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: David, I would also follow up that there's an old business adage, it takes money to make money, and we've seen margin expansion. And so we're very pleased to take up our net yield growth by over 8%, and only having to increase costs overall by 25 basis points is a very strong trade-off that I'll take any time. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's a great point, and I appreciate that color. Some of your peers have \u2013 seem to be investing in marketing and revenue-generating spend ahead of expected future demand for even next year. Is that something that you might be anticipating within your budgets, either this year or next year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, certainly it just doesn't happen automatically. Our marketing spend, while in line with expectation, is generating very, very strong results in terms of both load and yield. Part of the revenue-generating initiatives we've undertaken is the CapEx that we've invested in revitalizing our vessels. And so that gives us an opportunity to showcase our ships in the best light possible. And our travel agent partners are recognizing that, and so are our guests. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, if I could, you mentioned Alibaba briefly, but I was wondering if there are any specific anecdotes you could pass along as to how well that partnership is progressing? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: They're great partners. We did some fantastic work alongside them to introduce Joy to the Chinese market. A lot of the impressions that I mentioned earlier in my commentary was a direct result of the marketing work that we did alongside them. We continue to have discussions with them on how we can commercialize, if you will, our partnership. We are still waiting for certain licenses that will allow us to sell our cruises directly to the consumer in China. And I think once that happens, we will be able to monetize if you will that relationship a little bit better. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Savino with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the back-half yield guidance. I think if you look at sort of what's implied for 3Q and 4Q, it implies a sort of a similar yield growth in the fourth quarter. And I would've thought given some of the comp issues in the third quarter that 4Q may be, sort of, sequentially stronger. So I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on that and if there's maybe something else that may hold back that 4Q yield growth. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Sure. So, as I've mentioned, we will not have the benefit of the Explorer or the Sirena in Q4 of this year. And instead, we have the benefit of the Joy, which is not accretive to yields but certainly is to the bottom line. And then on top of it, it is the remaining category of cabins left to sell, again, primarily Norwegian, primarily (49:56) that don't tend to help the overall corporate yield. Obviously, on a standalone basis for Norwegian (50:05) but not when you take the blended NCLH (50:08). So we believe we've put out appropriate guidance for the implied Q4. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a quick housekeeping question, you talked about a higher mix of MGO in the quarter which drove up your fuel expenses a bit. What's the right sort of mix between HFO and MGO in the back half and then going forward into 2018? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: It's roughly a 70%-30% mix; 70% HFO, 30% on MGO. That's pretty good. And then, just keep in mind, too, we're approximately 76% hedged. In the press release, we break that out by the types of fuel and there's approximately an 80% to 90% correlation there. Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thank you. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rebecca Stone - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Rebecca Stone on for Stephen Grambling. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the higher marketing expense. How much of that is coming from the Norwegian Joy versus marketing programs, such as targeting Europe itineraries more or new initiatives related to targeting new-to-cruise consumers and your expectations for that higher marketing expense going forward? Thanks. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi. So we had already talked about the fact that there was $15 million incremental expense that would be in the first half of 2017 versus 2016, and that would be initial startup, marketing, offices et cetera to make our entrance into the Chinese market. Then, of course in Q1 on our last quarter call, we talked about the fact that we were having incremental marketing expenses for both Cuba and China post the South Korea travel ban, which that extrapolated to about $7 million between Q2 and Q4 of this year Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. But the spend that we're incurring is certainly a very \u2013 what I would call a very efficient spend, given how well booked we are for the rest of 2017 and my commentary on the status of bookings for 2018 versus what we're spending in marketing is very efficient. Bookings are coming in strong, and we're not having to over-market, if you will or over promote. It's a very, very good pipeline. And so we don't see marketing expense being a driver of costs, certainly not in the next two quarters. Rebecca Stone - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more about your Fleet Enhancement Program. What has feedback been with Edge? What changes have you made exceeded your expectations or what changes been the largest contributors to higher onboard spend on these ships? Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: The Norwegian Edge program and also the similar program that we launched on the Regent brand has been very, very well received by travel agents and consumers, both. We revitalized both staterooms and public areas. We've introduced new restaurant concepts. And by making the ship's general atmosphere, general look being refreshed, more relevant, people feel better onboard. They're out of their cabins, if you will, and just it's an environment that facilitates higher spend. And, as you know, the Norwegian brand leads the industry by a very wide margin in its ability to generate onboard revenue. So we're very, very pleased that we're able to do this relatively quickly. Now with 15 ships, we've been able to do this over a three-year period. 2018 is the last year of The Norwegian Edge program in any big way. I believe we will have one more vessel to dry dock and refurbish in 2019, so the heavy lifting, if you will, for the programs including the Regent program will end in 2018. Rebecca Stone - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. We have time for one more question, Leanne, and there is anybody there? Operator : Your last question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thanks for squeezing me in here. A question on like-for-like, you mentioned that it was, I think, 5% of the 8% in 2Q. Curious how much of the 4.25% that you expect for this year and the 1.8% last year was like-for-like? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: That's a great question, Vince. So it's actually immaterial on full year and it's because of the strength that we gain from an NCLH blend perspective with bringing in the Regent Seven Seas Explorer and the Oceania Sirena in the first half of the year, offsetting not having them in the back half where we're bringing in additional Norwegian capacity. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for explaining those moving pieces. And then, also, you've emphasized how Norwegian is kind of more of an earnings growth story given how new ships can swing yields and that maybe it's not indicative of the core trend. So, if you just take a step back and think about Europe specifically this year, are your like-for-like ships there growing earnings year-over-year in Europe? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. That's a very pertinent question. I will tell you that NPDs (56:08) for our Q3 will be up 5% on a like-for-like basis. And the difference between like-and-like and the overall is that Getaway is in the Baltic for the first time this summer. So, 5% growth in Q3 given the prior commentary about how some of the inventory for Q3 Europe had sold earlier on in the booking cycle before the upturn in bookings, I think bodes very well. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, thanks, everyone, for your time and support this morning. And as always, we will all be available to answer any questions you may have later in the day. All the best, bye- bye Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Tekia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2017 earnings call. I\u2019m joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide an update to 2017 guidance, before turning the call back to Frank for closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com and will be available for replay for 30 days following today\u2019s call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover just a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2017 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Well, thank you, Andrea and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that Norwegian\u2019s third quarter business continued to benefit from the positive momentum and dynamic booking environment that has been building throughout 2017. The sustained and robust consumer demand from all our top source markets for major destinations has resulted in a booking curve that is at an all-time high and which has yielded very strong pricing for voyages throughout the third quarter and beyond. Accordingly, our 2018 booked position for both load and pricing continues to be meaningfully ahead of this year\u2019s record levels across all three of our brands, despite the disruptions to our normal booking patterns caused by the unprecedented hurricanes we witnessed during the last 6 weeks of the quarter. As the third quarter began, the 25 ships in our fleet were well positioned in their customary premium deployments of Europe, Alaska, Bermuda and other peak season destinations. The combination of strong consumer demand coupled with premium price deployment, particularly in a resurging Europe, propelled our third quarter adjusted net yield to record levels. Our third quarter also chronicles the highest revenue, highest earnings and most guests ever carried in any single quarter in our company\u2019s history. In short, Q3 was exceptional both in terms of results posted and in its contributions to future performance. What is more impressive is that these financial results came amidst the challenges wrought by one of the most active hurricane seasons on record, one which affected to varying degrees over 50 million people in communities throughout the Caribbean, Texas and Florida. The lost revenue from two shortened sailings and the outright cancellation of an additional three along with costs associated with our humanitarian and other relief efforts resulted in an impact of $0.06 per share in the quarter. This impact was mitigated by outside performance in other major markets that produced a $0.03 beat to our earnings guidance for the quarter. When hurricanes Irma and Maria began to impact Eastern Caribbean basin in early September, bookings for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year for Caribbean sailings slowed dramatically for the ensuing six weeks. During that time, booking velocity and pricing for other deployments were not affected and remained strong, with the net result being that our booked positions lost some of its lead, but still remained ahead of prior year. Bookings for Caribbean sailings have since rebounded to pre-hurricane levels and are now recapturing the volume lost during that six-week slowdown. Our thoughts continue to be with those impacted by the storms, especially our friends to the South in the Eastern Caribbean basin. The effect of these weather related events continue to be felt in these communities in varying degrees. And I\u2019m extremely proud of the response from my colleagues in the industry and of course, from the crew and team members across our 3 brands, who lent both a physical and financial hand in helping get the region back on its feet. From evacuating stranded guests from the U.S. Virgin Islands to partnering with charitable organizations and delivering relief supplies to Cuba, we continue to show our support and compassion for the impacted areas. Our efforts continue with the launch of the Hope Starts Here hurricane relief fund in partnership both All Hands Volunteers. 100% of donations to Hope Starts Here, up to $1.25 million, will be matched dollar for dollar by the company, with the proceeds earmarked to rebuilding schools in the areas affected by the recent hurricanes. I urge you to find out more about this worthy cause and consider a donation by going to the hurricane relief section of the NCLH corporate site. Now turning back the third quarter. Our strong financial performance was also bolstered by several successful initiatives across our 3 brands which grew top and bottom line results above expectations. Our deployment optimization initiatives resulted in more capacity being deployed to premium, higher-priced destinations during the Europe peak season, such as Norwegian Getaway\u2019s deployment in the Baltic region, where she is benefiting from continued strong demand from North Americans. Deployment optimization initiatives such as this will also benefit future periods. We have also made significant strides in raising pricing from internationally sourced guests, particularly for the Norwegian brand, by strategically enhancing the value of our cruise vacations and building more value-added features and amenities into the base cruise fare. The improvement in pricing is such that we are now indifferent as to where a guest is sourced from. We believe this achievement is not to be overlooked as it provides the company much greater flexibility in its sales, marketing and revenue management efforts to optimize pricing across a variety of source markets. The rebound in North American demand for European voyages coupled with our strategic international pricing initiatives have resulted in strong overall pricing for our European itineraries, which have now exceeded the previous record levels set in 2015 and is a trend that we see continuing into 2018. Of course, highlighting our international expansion and diversification strategy, during the Q, we completed our first full quarter of peak season sailings on our new China-based ship, Norwegian Joy. [Technical Difficulty] On current trends, we expect our full year business in China to perform in line with our revised expectations and to be profitable in this, our very first year of operation in this high potential market. With our first full year of operations coming up in 2018, we look forward to our China-based ship contributing even greater profits to the company\u2019s bottom line now and well into the future. We view our contribution to the growth of the Chinese market as steadfast and as a long-term investment worth nurturing. Looking ahead and while acknowledging that the booking environment through 2017 has been among the best in the industry\u2019s history, we believe that based on our forward booked position, 2018 will continue Norwegian\u2019s string of strong financial performance leading to further earnings growth in ROIC and margin expansion. One area that will certainly contribute to our expected improved performance in 2018 is our doubling of sailings to Cuba. As the first cruise operator to have its full portfolio of brands approved to sail to the island, Norwegian continues its position as the premier operator of sailings to Cuba. In the coming years, ships from all three of our brands will call on Havana and other Cuban port cities, more than doubling the number of high-yielding sailings to Cuba, which will represent approximately 4% of our fleet-wide capacity in 2018. Also midway through 2018, we welcome our third Breakaway Plus class ship, Norwegian Bliss, to the fleet. The ship has benefited from the strong booking environment we have been discussing to become the best booked newbuild, both in terms of load and pricing in Norwegian\u2019s brand history. I\u2019ll be discussing more about Norwegian Bliss later on. But for now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Wendy to go over our record results for the quarter and guidance for the remainder of the year in more detail. Wendy? Wendy Beck : Thank you, Frank. Good morning, everyone. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2017 and 2016 adjusted net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I\u2019ll begin with commentary on our third quarter results, followed by color on booking trends, and then we\u2019ll close with our outlook and guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2017. The third quarter of 2017 marks the latest in a series of record-setting quarters for the company. Both revenue and earnings were the highest in our history, and results exceeded expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 above guidance of approximately $1.83. Excluding the direct impact of the weather related events, adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.06 higher or $1.92, which reflects the strength in our overall business. Adjusted net yield increased 3% or 3.1% on an as-reported basis versus the prior year, outperforming guidance expectations of up 1.75%, driven by strong close-in demand, coupled with continued strength in onboard revenue. Excluding the lapping of Seven Seas Explorer\u2019s inaugural season and the premium price Norwegian Getaway Rio charter in 2016, along with the addition of the Norwegian Joy and the impact of weather related events in 2017, our third quarter adjusted net yield growth would have been in excess of 7%. Looking at costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, was in line with guidance, increasing 50 basis points versus prior year on both a constant currency and as-reported basis due to a slight increase in marketing and general and administrative expenses as well as hurricane-related costs, primarily as a result of our humanitarian efforts, offset by the timing of certain expenses into the fourth quarter. Turning to fuel. Our fuel expense per metric ton net of hedges decreased 4.7% to $476 from $500 in the prior year. The increase in our fuel price per metric ton was unfavorable versus guidance, primarily due to rising prices since our last earnings call. Taking a look below the line. Interest expense net increased to $66.3 million compared to $60.7 million in the prior year. Interest expense for 2017 reflects an increase in average debt balances outstanding, primarily associated with the delivery of new ships and new build installments as well as higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR. Additionally, tax expense was higher than expected due to the strong performance of our U.S.-based operations. Looking ahead, capacity for the fourth quarter is expected to increase approximately 9%, primarily due to the addition of Norwegian Joy to our fleet. As for deployment mix for the fourth quarter, approximately 47% is allocated to the Caribbean, which is in line with prior year. Europe represents approximately 14%, down slightly from prior year. In the Asia, Africa, Pacific region, which has become a sizable share of our global deployment mix due to the introduction of Norwegian Joy to the Chinese market, accounts for approximately 13%, up from 6% in the prior year. Now focusing on expectations for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 2.25% or 2.5% on an as-reported basis. To demonstrate the underlying strength in our organic fleet, our guidance for fourth quarter adjusted net yield growth would have been in excess of 5% when excluding the weather-related events as well as our new Norwegian brand capacity, which is dilutive to the NCLH corporate average. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up 2.25% or 2.5% on an as-reported basis, primarily driven by expenses related to increased operating costs and humanitarian efforts as a direct result of the hurricanes, marketing initiatives to stimulate demand for Caribbean sailings post-hurricanes, costs associated with the technical issue on Norwegian Gem and the timing of certain expenses from the prior quarter. Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $440 with expected consumption of approximately 205,000 metric tons. The increase in fuel expense is primarily the result of the impact of rising fuel prices since our last earnings call. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $0.62. Turning to the full year, as Frank mentioned in his opening remarks, the booking environment has remained extremely strong. Strength across all three brands has resulted in the raising of our outlook for adjusted net yield growth by 50 basis points and is now expected to be up approximately 4.75% or 4.5% on an as-reported basis. Turning to costs. Due to the aforementioned items in my Q4 commentary, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is now expected to be up 2.75% on both a constant currency and as-reported basis. Looking at fuel expense. Our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges is now expected to be $458 with expected consumption of approximately 780,000 metric tons. As a result, our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be approximately $3.90. If not for storm-related headwinds of $0.12 along with $0.03 from the aforementioned technical issue on Norwegian Gem, guidance would have been $0.15 higher or approximately $4.05 above the high end of our prior guidance range as a result of out-performance in the third quarter and higher top line growth expected in Q4. I\u2019d now like to take a moment to discuss our outlook for 2018. As Frank mentioned, the positive operating environment we\u2019ve seen throughout this year continues to extend into 2018, which remains well ahead of prior year, both in load and pricing. All 3 brands are firing on all cylinders and will contribute to what we expect will be another record-breaking year. While we are not ready to provide 2018 guidance at this time, items to keep in mind include the following : When looking at our NCLH corporate yield growth, keep in mind that yields for first half of 2018 will naturally be lower than the second half, as we lap the final quarters of the inaugural year of the high-yielding Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Cruises Sirena. In addition, the first half of 2018 will include the low yielding shoulder season of Norwegian Joy. As for cost, next year will be the last year of heavy lifting for our Norwegian Edge and Regent Seven Seas revitalization programs. As a result, scheduled dry-dock days will roughly double versus the prior year, primarily due to these longer more extensive dry-docks, with the majority of the year-over-year variance impacting the second quarter. As we look to the future, we remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet through deleveraging. We are now back to our target of sub-4x leverage. And over the next 12 months, we expect to meaningfully delever down to the low 3s, at which point our focus will pivot to returning capital to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn over the call back to Frank for closing remarks. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Wendy. We recently unveiled that several of the cutting-edge and high-tech focused entertainment features and offerings, that have already proved popular aboard Norwegian Joy, will also be part of the guest experience on Norwegian Bliss. These include the largest electric car racetrack at sea, a half-acre outdoor laser tag course, and the brand\u2019s largest and most exciting aqua park featuring ocean loops and aqua racer waterslides. New and popular dining venues and lounge concepts also abound on Bliss with the Q-Texas Smokehouse, elevated Mexican cuisine in Los Lobos and the latest outlets of Margaritaville at Sea and The Cellars in Michael Mondavi\u2019s family wine bar. As I stated earlier, even prior to the announcement of these incredible new offerings, Norwegian Bliss was already the best booked positioned ship in both load and pricing in our company\u2019s history. We expect her strong performance to continue, supported by the marketing initiatives and media coverage surrounding these unique and special features as well as the inaugural activities that will occur midway through 2018. And lastly, before turning the call over to Q&A, I wanted to cover one recent significant milestone for our company. Last month, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings was selected to join the S&P 500 Index. This is a particularly significant achievement for a company that has been trading in the public equity market for less than five years and highlights our solid track record of consistent and improved financial performance. This accomplishment is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the entire team at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, from our shipboard officers and crew to our shore-side employees and our supportive Board of Directors. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is now open. Felicia Hendrix : Hey, Frank, intra-quarter, there was just some discussion on China regarding the belief that you were frustrated with current operations there. You did address a lot of that in your prepared remarks, but I was just wondering if you could get a little bit deeper regarding your view on the Joy there, its positioning? And then also last quarter, you expressed frustration with the South Korea restrictions, and it now looks like they may be lifted. So I was just wondering if that makes you more optimistic regarding next year as you begin your contract negotiations for \u201818 sailings, and if you can build a lever into pricing if South Korea does come back as an option. Frank Del Rio : Yes, Felicia. Yes, look, China is a very exciting and dynamic place. We now have a full four months of experience under our belt, which we appreciate, we\u2019re enjoying. But it is still a work in process, not just for us but for the industry, quite frankly. You have to look at China as a long-term investment that needs nurturing. And as all long-term investments, there\u2019s going to be ups and downs and bumps on the road that some of them that we have seen. But it is important to talk about some of these bumps so that it can be addressed. And so that is the point that I had made earlier. But we\u2019re very, very pleased with the performance of Joy. She is performing in line. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re profitable in China. And I think that ought to be recognized that a brand-new ship with a brand-new brand that enters this incredible potential market can be profitable in its first year of operation. Mind you, only really a half year of operation because we introduced Joy literally on July 1st, so very pleased with that. For 2018, there are reasons to be excited. The -- it will be the first year that capacity is down in China. So anytime you have flat to lesser capacity, those that remain in the marketplace should enjoy some renewed strength on the demand side. And of course, the renewed conversation about South Korea can only help. As I think you\u2019ve heard me say many times before, the number one leading driver of yields is itineraries. And so if we can bring South Korea back to our itineraries, they will improve the itineraries, make it more attractive to consumers, and I think that will help pricing, so very encouraged by that potential development. Felicia Hendrix : And Wendy, just in your prepared remarks, you had talked about the net yields for your guidance for the fourth quarter would have been over 5% if you were to adjust it for the hurricanes and Joy. Just wondering if you could give us what the hurricane impact was, if you could just peel that out of that number? Wendy Beck : Yes. So in general, what I would say is the hurricanes cost us about $0.12 for the back half of the year, of which $0.06 is for Q3, $0.06 is for Q4. And the way I would look at that is the vast majority of the $0.06 in Q3 was revenue-related, primarily due to canceled sailings. And the vast majority of the $0.06 in Q4 is expense-related. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Greg Badishkanian : And Frank, you mentioned that occupancy and load as well as pricing were up meaningfully ahead in 2018. But to kind of follow up to that, which regions were particularly strong, either from a sourcing or itinerary basis? And then the second part is, if you\u2019re meaningfully ahead on occupancy, would that imply that prices -- assuming a similar environment, prices are likely to increase even further as you go into and throughout 2018? Frank Del Rio : Well, you just defined revenue management, Greg. Look, I can\u2019t think of a major operating arena that is not performing well for 2018. The Caribbean is strong. We did have that six week interruption, but she\u2019s come back roaring. Europe, as I said several times in my prepared remarks, is very, very strong both in load and in pricing, especially in pricing. Alaska continues a string of several years now where performance is just incredible, and in our case, it\u2019s helped by Bliss. Bliss is attracting incredible demand and reflected in price, so all markets are performing really, really well. All source markets are particularly performing well led by North America, but the Eurozone is also contributing very, very strongly. I would tell you that while we are meaningfully ahead in both load and in pricing, the star performer of those two metrics is pricing. So we clearly see that we\u2019re ahead in pricing, and we\u2019re very alert to be able to raise pricing along the way. And each of the brands are ahead again meaningfully in pricing versus same time last year. And that\u2019s very, very promising that we\u2019re ahead at this point, as we are about to approach 2018, meaningfully ahead in load and that it\u2019s also translating to strong pricing. So it\u2019s a good situation, Greg. Greg Badishkanian : Great. And just on the Caribbean having returned to pre-storm levels, what\u2019s the promotional environment looking like for 4Q and 1Q for just the value adds and promotions? And then I\u2019m assuming that really trails off beyond -- in later 2018, there\u2019s no need to really promote for those sailings, but I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m asking the question again. Frank Del Rio : Look, during the actual two weeks when the hurricanes were affecting the areas and for the next three to four weeks immediately afterwards, the marketplace was no -- it was in no mood to book anything in the Caribbean. And that is certainly reflected in the slowdown in the bookings that we took. And so we thought it was not effective to do much marketing during that time frame. And so promotional activity was pretty much a nonfactor during that two weeks during and the immediate aftermath. Once the islands began to announce that they were coming back and there was not front-page news, we did initiate some promotional activity that would have probably been a little more aggressive than we would have taken had the hurricane not taken place, because we needed to trigger the -- and spur additional momentum. That additional promotional activity will end right at Thanksgiving. And from Thanksgiving forward through Q1, our promotional calendar is exactly what it would have been, had the hurricane not taken place. Because we see the lost business that didn\u2019t materialize during that six week period, we ought to be back to call it par. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Savino of Morgan Stanley. Mark Savino : As it relates to the China market, I know you guys had talked in the past about hopefully being able to sell direct to consumers. Just wondering if there\u2019s been any updates on that front and when you think you may be able to do that, and how beneficial that might be to your overall yields in that market. Frank Del Rio : The necessary conditions to sell direct was to obtain what is referred to as the operational license. And we\u2019re pleased to report that just in the last 10 days, we\u2019ve obtained it. So now we go into that mode of trying to, in essence, monetize that opportunity. As you recall, we have a relationship with Alibaba that had sort of been on hold until we received this operational license. We really like the potential that the Alibaba relationship can bring us. I don\u2019t need to tell you of Alibaba\u2019s prowess in ecommerce in China, their prowess in data mining. And we believe that among 1.4 billion Chinese consumers, that only 2 million cruise a year, data mining is very important, perhaps more important than it is in -- certainly more important than it is in the Western world. So we are very conscious about that opportunity and look forward to researching all the opportunities that having that relationship with Alibaba brings. And look, if it can be achieved, certainly having another strong channel to distribute our brand\u2019s products directly to the consumer, where the cruise line has more influence, more control of the pricing, would be a good thing. And we also think that having that platform will help our travel agent partners by being able to promote our product that they have chartered or contracted for, to be able to sell it through that very popular platform, is a win-win for everyone. Mark Savino : Very helpful. And then as it relates to Cuba, just wondering if you can maybe give a little more color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing on the demand front there, specifically, if there\u2019s been any impact from some of the recent travel warnings that we see. Frank Del Rio : The quick answer is no, Mark. Cuba remains the star of the show for the year. The booking curve continues to behave like a booking curve of a much longer, more exotic destination. As you know, typically booking curve for 3 and 4-day cruises, the Bahamas, is very, very short. The Cuba itineraries have proven that to be just wrong. And in terms of pricing, while I won\u2019t give you a number, I would just tell you that it is substantial -- the demand that there is for Cuba and the way we\u2019ve been able to take up pricing and demand continues. Onboard spend, primarily because of shore excursions on the island, are much stronger than they would have been on our Bahamas-only 4-day cruise. So as you know, during the last 3 or 4 months that the administration has issued several different directives regarding Cuba, the one you mentioned of the travel warning -- for the first week or so, we probably had more chatter on the calls, people wanting to know what it really meant more than anything else. We didn\u2019t see a real slowdown in bookings, just more chatter and more questions. And then of course, yesterday\u2019s OFAC regulations that were issued cleared up a lot of the mystery and a lot of the concerns that some people had, which is very, very good for the cruise industry. I think yesterday\u2019s regulations clearly show that going on a cruise to Cuba is the easiest and less hassle-free way to visit the island. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Harry Curtis : I wanted to turn to -- back to Europe. Frank, I don\u2019t know if you have this at your fingertips, but I\u2019m curious if you have a sense of how much earnings power in the third quarter you may have given up by perhaps selling -- pre-selling Europe more aggressively a year ago. And does your strategy change for 2018? Frank Del Rio : Look, there\u2019s no question that if we had, had a crystal ball, had we known that 2017\u2019s booking environment was going to be as strong as it ends up being that we would have raised prices sooner. So, yes, we probably left money on the table because the -- you have to understand that the improvement in the European booking environment was very, very quick and very dramatic from what we saw throughout 2016 as a result of all the geopolitical events that happened in Europe. It\u2019s difficult for me to quantify how much higher our yield growth would have been, how much higher our profits would have been had we had that crystal ball. But look, we\u2019re very pleased with the results as they are. We had more capacity in Europe in 2017 than we had, had in the past, primarily at the Norwegian brand because of Getaway\u2019s redeployment from the Caribbean to the Baltic. For 2018, let\u2019s just say that we learned our lesson a bit because that strong environment that we saw developing throughout \u201817 has continued in \u201818. And so we have been more quick to the punch, if you will, to start off \u201818 with a higher price point, and we continue moving it up. So 2017, we reached, we broached the high-water mark of 2015. So certainly the trend is positive. \u201817 hit an all-time high, and we expect 2018 yields to beat 2017. So Europe is a good news story right now. Harry Curtis : And then just as a follow-up on Europe, let\u2019s say, God forbid that Europe gets into geo pushed year. From a sourcing point of view, if it were to happen, are you better positioned to deal with it in \u201818 than you were in \u201816 and \u201817? Frank Del Rio : No question. I think you heard me say that through modifying the delivery of our product, how we market our product in international markets, primarily in Europe, from just a naked cruise to a bundled product, we\u2019ve been able to raise prices in a way that has not detracted from our ability to generate more volume. So our volume, just in outright numbers of bookings, have increased in the teens in -- during 2017. And as I said earlier, from a pricing perspective, we\u2019re indifferent whether the guest books from Germany, the UK, France or Minnesota. But certainly, Harry, the proof will be when you have to stress test that situation, and a lot will depend on how severe the geopolitical events are. I\u2019m happy to report that this year, 2017, we\u2019ve had several geopolitical events in Europe, several in London. We had Barcelona. And we haven\u2019t seen any interruptions in business whatsoever. Of course, they weren\u2019t as severe as what we saw in \u201816. And you can make an argument that perhaps the American consumer has become a little insensitive, if you will, as taking these kinds of events more in stride. But certainly, so far, 2017 has proven to be a strong booking period for both in-year Europe business and for 2018 business. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Andrew Didora : Frank, maybe switching back to China. I know -- I understand that it\u2019s early days there. But maybe could you give us a sense of maybe what you\u2019ve learned so far in terms of operating in the market, maybe what has surprised you on both the good and the bad ends? And then I know this is a long-term -- a market for long-term environment, but has your view of the capital spend that\u2019s needed in the market changed at all since the launch of the Joy a few months ago? Frank Del Rio : No, my views haven\u2019t changed in terms of capital. I think the Chinese consumer is a consumer who knows exactly what they want. We know that the Chinese consumer is the world\u2019s largest consumer of upscale luxury products. And if you\u2019re going to compete effectively in China, you got to have your best hardware there. And so we\u2019re glad that the Joy is there and -- can compete as effectively as she does. Some of the learnings, of course, we\u2019ve learned; we\u2019ve learned a lot and we continue to learn. We are surprised, pleasantly surprised perhaps, at the volume of people. The Joy has the highest occupancy of any of our ships, especially in the peak season when it\u2019s primarily families and multigenerational groups coming online. And so one thing that we learned that you might chuckle at is they sure like to eat. And so our food costs in China are a little bit higher than we originally expected because they do enjoy their meals. We like to find ways to introduce shore excursions, quite frankly, into the product mix. As you know, shore excursions and the ability to enjoy a destination is a key component of why people take vacations around the world. And in China thus far, it is not very popular. The typical Chinese consumer wants to go to the Japanese islands that we visit, or hopefully South Korea as well in the future, to shop. And while that helps certainly our onboard revenue in the shops is 60% more space on Norwegian Joy than our typical Breakaway-class vessel, and that shopping mentality certainly helps our onboard retail, we would love to see shore excursions be brought into the mix. Because we think it helps diversify the product. I think the word of mouth back home would be even better when they go back and tell their friends and family what a wonderful time they had on the ship because of the onboard experience, and also the experiences on shore. And because shore, quite frankly, is a high margin item that we promote. So there are areas that need improvement in China, and I think those have been relatively well-documented. The distribution system needs to be broader. We hope to achieve some of that through the comments I made earlier about our relationship with Alibaba and now that we have the operational license. But certainly, China is a work in process. You got to keep your eye on the big picture, and that is, there\u2019s 1.4 billion people, the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, miles and miles and miles of coastline, a government that is supportive of the cruise industry being a major part of their citizenship\u2019s vacation plans. And so you have to be excited about the potential in China, and we certainly are. Andrew Didora : That\u2019s great color. Second question for Wendy, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that your leverage is now in line with your goal. And based on \u201818 numbers, obviously gets better as you go through next year. In terms of capital returns, do you prefer more of a dividend strategy, maybe putting a yield more on par with other cruise companies? Or could we see more of a dual strategy with buybacks given the valuation discount that you currently trade at? Wendy Beck : So we are pleased to be sub-4 times at this point on a leverage standpoint, and we are very focused right now of getting down into the low 3 times. So plan that for the majority of \u201818 anyways as we continue to delever at a pretty rapid pace. We do still have 264 million availability under our share repurchase program. We have that, and we can remain opportunistic using that. But we are primarily focused on deleveraging at this point once we get to the low threes. And at that point, it -- I think you would see a combination of things, both a dividend program as well as share repurchases. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : So, Frank, two bigger picture questions for you, I guess. When we look at your competitors, it seems they\u2019ve been getting more aggressive on the technology side of things, trying to improve the customer experience both the fore-boarding and then post-boarding. Also trying to capture more of that onboard spend. To us, you guys have always been the on-board\u2019s kind of trend setter. And I guess what I\u2019m getting at here is where do you guys stand in terms of trying to keep up with your competitors? We haven\u2019t really heard any big over-the-top type of announcement from you guys, but I assume you\u2019re not sitting back either and not doing anything on that front. Frank Del Rio : Stay tuned, Steve. It\u2019s coming. We\u2019re very happy to see our peers doing what they\u2019re doing. I think it\u2019s just a reflection of consumers in their everyday life because at the end of the day, what you see on board cruise ships is that as we\u2019ve evolved throughout the years, how we\u2019ve evolved in building ships and the lifestyle onboard, it\u2019s just a reflection of what\u2019s going on in their everyday lives. So today, it\u2019s a digital world, and the migration from an analog world to a digital world occurred some time ago. It\u2019s just that the pace of acceleration has sped up. And so I\u2019m pleased to see what others are doing, we\u2019re going to be -- we will be announcing our strategy very, very soon. I don\u2019t think that an earnings call is the best way to -- the best time to announce it. We want to get our marketing bang for our buck. But in the meantime, we\u2019re very, very pleased at the investments we\u2019ve made in technologies that customers can enjoy very interactively. And I\u2019d point out to the Galaxy Pavilion that we\u2019ve rolled out in -- on Norwegian Joy. It has every conceivable high-tech, state-of-the-art, virtual reality game and experience that\u2019s available in the world today. And it is jampacked every day, and we plan on rolling that out on -- in the future. And of course, the icon, if you will, of Joy is the racetrack, has proven very, very popular. Who would have thought just 5, 10 years ago, that you could have a 1,000-foot track -- racetrack of two stories, eight turns, zipping miles per hour in the middle of the ocean. So those kinds of technological advances have proven very popular for us. And we expect to engage and be competitive and like I said, stay tuned for more. Steve Wieczynski : Second question, Pride of America is an absolute machine for you guys. And yes, we know it\u2019s more costly from a staffing perspective and a tax perspective, and you don\u2019t have the excess capacity that some of your competitors have. But Frank, is that a market you would consider putting more capacity in over time, given how strong the market currently is? Frank Del Rio : Yes, especially with our Leonardo project ship starting to roll in, in 2022. We can certainly see where having additional tonnage in Hawaii would pay off, no question. Operator : Our next question comes from David Beckel of Bernstein. David Beckel : Last quarter, you had mentioned that you, in China specifically, would be implementing initiatives to improve onboard yields. You talked a bit about that, but I\u2019m wondering, actually more specifically, and you just talked about shore excursions in that region. Are you finding it that the demand for traditional shore excursions is low? Or are the chartering agents themselves in any way, preventing you from offering the types of packages that you\u2019d like? Frank Del Rio : I don\u2019t think they\u2019re preventing. I think that the way the chartering agents are selling the product in many ways is being sold as a shopping tour, a shopping excursion, as opposed to a cruise in the full sense of the word that we in the Western world would look at it. So I see it as a huge opportunity to start educating consumers, or start educating the travel agents, that there is a whole opportunity beyond just shopping. But of course, part of the issue is the itineraries. You -- the consumer likes short cruises, 4-day cruises. And with South Korea not being part of the mix, that means you must spend 2 days at sea, 1 to get to the island from Shanghai, and then 1 to get back to Shanghai, which if shopping is important to them, doesn\u2019t leave much time for anything else. So we believe that hopefully when South Korea comes back on, that there\u2019ll be more of a balance to these short cruises, between not just shopping excursions, but also visiting these places for the wonderful cultural historical features that they have available. David Beckel : That\u2019s helpful, and it\u2019s actually a good segue to my second question. We were over there recently. And based on conversations we\u2019ve had with agents, it seems like there is a fair amount of unmet demand at the higher end of the market. We all know what\u2019s going on at the mass end. But in theory, your hardware would be ideally suited for such a service over there. Is that something you\u2019ve explored? Or does that seem like heresy at this point, given the market\u2019s maturation? Frank Del Rio : No, no heresy. We\u2019re focused on the high-end markets through our Oceania and Regent brands on flight cruises, where we believe that, that by definition, the high-end consumer wants a more rigorous Western-flavored cruise experience to places like Europe or Alaska, South America than just coastal cruises. So the emphasis on the high end is primarily in the Oceania, Regent flights cruises to distant places. And it\u2019s working very well. It\u2019s one of our fastest-growing -- small numbers, mind you, but fastest-growing source markets for those 2 brands. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Robin Farley : Great, obviously the yield commentary, very encouraging. I wanted to understand a little bit better about the expense increase in Q4. You mentioned the hurricane disruptions falling half in Q3, half in Q4. And I guess it seemed like Royal\u2019s commentary, 80% of the disruption was Q3, not much in Q4. So I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s just something accounting-wise with future cruise credits or something that is making -- it impacts the expense in Q4 more than we would expect. And then the change in your guidance for Q4 expense is something like 400 basis points. So just it looks like there are other significant pieces of expense there that\u2019s outside of the hurricane disruption, and maybe if you could quantify a little bit if some expense has shifted from Q3 to Q4, or just sort of quantify some of the other factors. Wendy Beck : So regarding the direct impact. I think the thing to note is that we changed the majority of our itineraries. And so we are calling new ports, and that has -- that\u2019s got a significantly higher port cost, operating cost due to changing those itineraries and not passing that along to the guests. Also, we\u2019ve got quite a bit of humanitarian supplies baked into that cost as well as displacement expenses for guests, activation, mobilization for our shore-side teams. And then to stimulate the demand, as Frank talked about earlier, it\u2019s a whole number of marketing initiatives that was really focused on stimulating demand for both Q4 and Q1 sailings. And the good news is it -- we have seen those marketing efforts come to fruition as bookings are now virtually back to pre-hurricane levels. Robin Farley : And so I guess that was -- some of it was marketing expense. But when you didn\u2019t spend in Q3, it shifted to Q4. The Gem expense, could you quantify what that is in Q4? Wendy Beck : Yes. So the Gem expense is a technical issue with one of the azipods. And there are -- it\u2019s probably about half revenue, half expense. But it\u2019s logistics, it\u2019s airfreight costs, technical teams, a number of expense items in getting that ship back up and running as well as canceled sailings. Robin Farley : And that would just be a Q4 issue? Or could that affect Q1 as well? Wendy Beck : No, that would be a Q4 issue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian : I\u2019m wondering if the Bliss and maybe the Joy could be skewing your 2018 commentary, and maybe even Cuba too? So would you say that same-ship loads and pricing is also up meaningfully year-over-year? And then is every single quarter of 2018 also up meaningfully on rate and load as well? Frank Del Rio : Yes and yes. Jared Shojaian : And then just sticking with the theme on costs, can you tell us what fuel looks like for 2018 at current spot prices and accounting for your hedges, and then maybe interest expense as well with some of the refinancing? And then on your nonfuel unit costs, obviously you have dry-dock headwinds, but you also have big tailwinds with mix shift and now reversing the hurricane impact. So is it reasonable that this line doesn\u2019t grow in 2018? Wendy Beck : So regarding fuel costs right now with the latest data that we have, fuel costs will actually be up slightly on a dollar basis year-over-year. And post our refinancing that actually closed in Q4, our interest will now be up roughly 10% whereas you may recall in the past, I said it was more like 15%. Regarding net cruise cost in general, we tell everybody to look at net cruise cost growth somewhere in that 1% to 2% range. We do have the benefit of bringing in the large Norwegian capacity. But then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got the additional cost related to the heavy lifting on the final year of the Norwegian Edge program as well as the Regent revitalization program, which is not only more dry-dock days but heavy lifting as well with that. Jared Shojaian : Are you able to tell us how much a dollar basis year-over-year that incremental dry-dock and Norwegian Edge contributes to next year? Wendy Beck : That\u2019s a great question, but we\u2019re not ready to provide guidance at this time on \u201818. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Vince Ciepiel : Just one follow-up on the cost, I\u2019m curious how management comp in China plays into net cruise cost into next year. Frank Del Rio : It\u2019s like any other cost. Management isn\u2019t incentivized to any greater degree on the China vessel as any other vessel. Wendy Beck : Unless you\u2019re asking for what\u2019s the effect as far as year-over-year, is that what you\u2019re asking? Vince Ciepiel : Yes. Yes, there was a return of incentive in \u201817, and I was wondering if that neutralizes in \u201818. There\u2019s also a step up in investment in China in \u201817. I was curious if that continues to step up, or the run rates that into \u201818. Wendy Beck : Okay, so that\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019m glad you asked that because comp and China costs should be on par year-over-year. So you won\u2019t see that stepping up. You\u2019ll now see that just rolling over year-over-year. Vince Ciepiel : Great, and one other, just supply-demand dynamics in a market like Alaska or even Europe longer-term. A number of your peers have noted they plan to bring capacity out of the Chinese market into more established markets like Europe and Alaska. I\u2019m just curious what incremental supply looks like for those markets and if that impacts your view of the trend line and potential yield growth? Frank Del Rio : No, not, really. I mean, there\u2019s relatively few vessels in China and certainly lesser number coming out of China. I don\u2019t believe that the increase in Alaska or in Europe from those vessels will change the supply/demand dynamic. Look, cruise lines chase yield. It is a fixed-cost business. And certainly Europe and Alaska is performing well. And I could certainly understand why certain lines are making the changes they\u2019re making. Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling : I have one quick follow-up and one broader question. I guess one on the follow-up on the strength in load and pricing by region, given the longer booking window for the Prestige brands, are you seeing any differences in the pricing among those bookings versus Norwegian brand? Frank Del Rio : No, no. Both Oceania and Regent are again performing very, very well for 2018. They\u2019re ahead in both load and pricing with pricing certainly taking center stage for them. There\u2019s no new capacity at the Oceania brand, no new capacity at the Regent brand. The markets are strong where they operate primarily in peak periods, meaning Europe and Alaska. And so as you would expect, we\u2019re taking up pricing nicely. Stephen Grambling : Great. And then the maybe nuanced broader question, your commissions, transport, and other line was a tailwind in the quarter and had been previously for a couple of years before the Prestige acquisition, what are the key components of that improvement? And what are the puts and takes to think about longer-term? Or asked another way, what percentage of your bookings are from third-party travel agents versus direct currently? How does that evolve? And how do you think that will evolve in the next few years? Wendy Beck : Yes, great questions. So we have done a lot to work on driving costs out of that line, but that has not been at the expense of the travel agent. It\u2019s really been in negotiating the other costs such as port fees, credit card fees, etcetera, things that actually fall into the expense lines. But specific to this quarter, what you\u2019re really seeing is more channel efficiency. There\u2019s less reliance on the OTAs. If you look at where we were in Q3 of \u201816 versus Q3 of \u201817, in Q3 of \u201816 we had much more capacity to still load. It was a much more urgent situation post all of the geopolitical events, whereas we have been well booked all year long less reliance and more efficient use of the travel agencies. Frank Del Rio : Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for your time, thank you for your support. As always, we will be available later in the afternoon to answer your questions. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn your conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. DeMarco, please go ahead. Andrea DeMarco Sieger - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy Stuart, President and Chief Financial Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line; and Mark Kempa, Senior Vice President of Finance.

As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover just a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2017 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Andrea, and hello, everyone. I would like to start off my comments this morning by letting you know that as I embark on my 25th year in the cruise industry and my fourth leading this amazing company that this year is by far the most excited, most energized and most optimistic I have ever been at the start of a New Year. 2018 is indeed shaping up to be another record-breaking year for the company. The strong demand environment that began late in third quarter of 2016 and continued to pick up steam throughout 2017 has accelerated through this year's early wave season, as both the number of new bookings sold and the price points achieved reached record levels at each of our three award-winning brands. In other words, while we turned the New Year in the best book position in our company's history, with total book revenue, load factor and net per diems at all-time highs, our overall book position during the first seven weeks of 2018 further improved compared to the same time last year. In addition, we believe that the increase in net ticket revenue, driven mainly by higher per diems, has and will continue to have a positive impact on onboard revenue as past experience has taught us that the more a guest spends on their cruise ticket, the more they tend to spend onboard. This strong sustained booking environment has been made possible by several factors, including widespread improvement across the major global economies and a U.S. consumer whose confidence is at or near all-time highs and driven by record-low unemployment, record-high stock market value, a low interest rate environment and most recently tax relief that is likely to increase discretionary spending. Collectively, these factors are contributing to strong consumer demand across all of our core source markets. This strong booking environment is also being fueled by an industry that continues to introduce marvelous new ships that pique consumers' interest, invest heavily in modernizing and refurbishing its legacy fleets and dedicates hundreds of millions of dollars annually marketing the virtues of a cruise vacation to travel agents and to public at large. Collectively, these positive and constructive factors have led to demand creation platform, the likes of which has never been seen before. This platform comes at a time when both millennials and baby boomer generations adopt cruising as a preferred vacation and find cruising to be the ideal vacation for all types of travelers, from solo travelers to newlywed couples and groups of friends to large generational families. Cruising has taken the mantel as the perfect vacation for nearly all leisure groups. Our company, in particular, is leveraging this strong worldwide demand for cruise vacations with the appeal of our young, modern and refurbished fleets deployed optimally across the globe and with our clear and compelling bundling strategy and value-add offerings that are resonating extremely well with our target market and, finally, with our time-tested and proven revenue management strategy, acutely focused on maximizing our pricing power by stimulating demand early in the booking curve. The result is record high book load factors and pricing for each of 2018's four quarters. And while load factors are at all-time highs and now approach optimal levels relative to sale date, the real star of the show, going forward, is our pricing power, with all three of our brands showing meaningful year-over-year pricing gains throughout 2018. And while still very early in the booking cycle, initial indications are that this fertile booking environment has a long tail as we are already seeing gains in both load factor and pricing into 2019, particularly for itineraries with extended booking curves. Two examples of the benefits of this near optimal booking curve, which, at year-end 2017, had elongated by nearly five weeks since the prior year and the related pricing gains had come hand-in-hand with early bookings are, first, the 11% year-over-year increase in advanced ticket sales at year-end 2017 with adjusted capacity growth, excluding the China-based Norwegian Joy of just 2%; and second, the recent update to our final payment policy for the Norwegian brand, which now requires full payment 120 days prior to sailing versus the decades-old 90-day window. The benefit of this change include accelerated cash flow, improved liquidity and most importantly, enhanced visibility and control over our inventory 30 days earlier than usual, enabling us to further strengthen pricing for close-in bookings. For our travel agent partners, the change reinforces our strategy to make the Norwegian brand their preferred brand to sell by accelerating payment of their hard-earned commissions of full 30 days earlier, significantly improving their cash flows. In a nutshell, the current booking environment is strong and is, once again, demonstrating the resilience of this industry and of our company, which, despite experiencing the most devastating hurricane season of the past 200 years, has achieved record results in 2017 and looks to do the same in 2018 and beyond. But before I get too far ahead looking into the future, I'd be remiss to omit mention of the many accomplishments achieved, initiatives launched and the strategies implemented to-date, the some of which have positioned us well for continued success in 2018 and beyond. A little over a month ago, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings celebrated the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, marking the occasion by ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. The major operational accomplishments achieved since our IPO can only be matched by our stellar financial performance. From the recent launch of Norwegian Joy, our company's largest ship to-date, to the 2016 launch of the world's most luxurious one, the Seven Seas Explorer, and from the creation of Harvest Caye, a new island destination in the Western Caribbean to the commencement of sailings to the island nation of Cuba with over 500 years of history, but effectively close to Americans for the past 60, the operational milestones reached by the company these last five years are indeed significant and worthy of a high place in Norwegian's storied 50-plus year history of constant and continued innovation. Also critical to our success story was the acquisition and seamless integration of Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises in 2014. This $3 billion plus transaction cemented our top-three position in the industry with an unequaled portfolio of three award-winning cruise brands, each with clear product propositions and differentiators that give each brand compelling competitive advantages. Combined, our three brands have successfully launched six ships in the last five years and have a pipeline of seven confirmed new builds extending through 2025, all with committed financing, which will grow the number of berths in our fleet by approximately 45%. The financial milestones reached during the last five years are equally impressive and every year since our IPO, we have posted double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share, including year-over-year earnings growth every quarter. We've recorded annual year-over-year growth in adjusted net yield and continue our string of quarterly trailing 12 -month adjusted EBITDA growth, reaching 38 consecutive quarters. During this five-year period, we have also doubled our revenue to over $5 billion, increased earnings per share six-fold and grew adjusted return on invested capital to double-digit levels. Looking at just 2017, the year had no shortage of operational and financial accomplishments, as many trades across the globe experienced strength in 2017, but perhaps none benefited more in this environment than our Europe itineraries and the launch of our voyages to Cuba. You will recall that successive geopolitical events through the summer of 2016 resulted in a noted depressed demand environment for European sailings. 2017, however, saw an unprecedented turnaround in demand for Europe voyages from our core North American customer, particularly for the brands that were disproportionately negatively impacted in 2016. The strength and speed of this turnaround was faster than anticipated, taking only one year for European itinerary pricing to recover and surpass 2015 prior peak levels. 2017 also saw our company make history as Oceania Cruises became the first established cruise brand and the first of our three brands to sail into Havana Harbor. The pent-up demand for sailings to the island resulted in all three brands achieving healthy pricing premiums compared to similar Caribbean voyages without calls to Cuba. The feedback from guests has been extraordinary and we have not only added calls to the island on existing itineraries, but we have also deployed a second ship in the Norwegian brand, the Norwegian Sun, to sail to Havana beginning in May of 2018. The island's strategic geographic location relative to major U.S. ports, its rich heritage, welcoming people and pent-up demand from our key U.S. source market continues to make Cuba one of the most sought-after and high per diem destinations in the world and one in which we will deploy 4% of our capacity to in 2018. Therefore, while 2017 yields benefited from the combination of strong and resurging demand for Europe sailings and the premium pricing from inaugural year of sailings to Cuba, these significant singular benefits combined contribute to a difficult year-over-year yield growth comparison for 2018. During 2017, we also expanded our global footprint with our mid-year entry into the Chinese cruise market with Norwegian Joy. Our team in China successfully launched a new brand with premium customized hardware and delivered a profitable venture in its first year of operation in a difficult operating environment, where the restrictions on travel to South Korea continue and the maturing and expansion of the distribution system is evolving slower than hoped. Despite these headwinds, we remain optimistic that the vast opportunities possible in China will come to fruition. And we are pleased to report that in her first year of operation, Norwegian Joy is consistently atop the guest satisfaction rankings of the Norwegian fleet and also enjoys the fleet's highest load factor. With these important successes boosting our resolve, we recently launched marketing, promotional and yield management strategies, that although novel in China, have proven successful in our other markets and we look forward to similar positive outcomes in China. Lastly, Joy is fully chartered for the first half of 2018 and we are encouraged that the second half of the year is better chartered than this time last year at slightly higher prices. China is just one of the inroads we have made in our international sourcing and diversification strategy. As I've mentioned in the past, the targeted sourcing initiatives we rolled out over the past few quarters in our core international markets have gotten us to a point where pricing for international source guests is at parity to or even slightly higher than that of North American-sourced guests, making us agnostic as to where a guest sails from. This advancement causes us to be even more enthusiastic than ever before in developing fast-growing international source markets such as the UK, Germany, Australia and various emerging Asian markets. In 2017, our core international markets outside of China grew revenue by 17%, with the majority of the increase coming from pricing gains derived from initiatives such as our value-add strategies and the Free at Sea consumer marketing campaigns that have been proven successful in North America. More impressive perhaps, is that this sizable revenue increase was achieved with essentially flat marketing spend, demonstrating the resonance of our offerings, the strength of the global demand environment and the tremendous job done by our international team across the globe. But our diversification strategy goes beyond just geography or itinerary deployment. Generational and demographic trends are playing important and critical roles in growing demand for cruise vacations to all-time highs. Today, the two largest generation populations, the baby boomers and the millennials, are reaching important tipping points in their lifecycles and our three brands are there and uniquely positioned to serve them. As you all know, 10,000 American baby boomers retire each day, adding to the largest population of individuals outside the mainstream workforce in history. These individuals, with large nest eggs and plenty of available leisure time, are also inordinately benefiting from the booming stock market and low interest rate environment, resulting in after-tax income gains that can be tapped for discretionary spending. At the same time, millennials have overtaken baby boomers as the single largest living generation. The sheer number of this cohort, which is about to enter its prime earning years, is influencing everything we do from the way we build our ships to the onboard offerings we provide, to the way we communicate with this populace. And while the way we engage with these very different groups and the experiences they seek in a vacation may differ somewhat, one factor that remains consistently important among these two vastly different generations is an emphasis on value and that is where the cruise industry really shines. Effectively communicating the incredible value proposition of a cruise vacation and the variety of activities available aboard today's modern cruise ships, such as casino gaming, fine dining, shopping, spa and visiting multiple exotic destinations in one vacation, is key in keeping these groups engaged. The sizable investments we have made in The Norwegian Edge and Regent Seven Seas fleet refurbishing programs are two other important initiatives aimed at engaging multi-generational guests by keeping our ships modern, fresh and relevant. These initiatives have enhanced our brands' hardware, allowing us to offer a more consistent and upscale experience across the fleet and providing us the ability and confidence to command higher per diems. The vast majority of vessels in the Norwegian brand will have undergone Edge enhancements by the end of 2018, while for Regent, the Seven Seas Mariner, the brand's last ship to undergo revitalization, will go into dry dock in the next three weeks. We also took an important step in keeping the Norwegian Cruise Line fleet cutting edge, four steps to be exact, as we extended our capacity growth profile with the announcement of an order for four next-generation cruise ships under the Project Leonardo banner. With an optimum footprint that allows for access to a more diverse mix of destinations, these 3,400 passenger cutting-edge ships will marry the modern variant upscale offering of our Breakaway Plus Class ships with the latest technological advancements in both ship operating systems and guest experiences. Turning to our financial accomplishments in 2017, they have been equally impressive, as we reached new highs in revenue, earnings, net yield and return on capital. Our net yield continues to be the highest in the industry, and by a wide margin I may add, and our ability to maintain and in fact add to this advantage is due to our unique mix of brands as well as targeted investments in both hardware enhancements and in the onboard guest experience. To give you an idea of how secure our net yield advantage truly is, please consider that the Norwegian brand alone, which at the time of our IPO in 2013, made NCLH the highest-yielding publicly traded cruise operator, which still on a standalone basis holds that first place position today. In terms of enhancing the guest experience, the Oceania brand has invested heavily in the trend towards healthier lifestyles, partnering with Canyon Ranch to offer unique in the industry fully-integrated wellness programs that include shore tours, fitness classes, signature spa treatments and award-winning cuisine, including the most expansive vegan menu at sea. At the Norwegian brand, we continue adding to our legacy of innovative first-at-sea offerings with the introduction of the industry's only ships, Norwegian Joy and Norwegian Bliss, to feature exciting electric go-kart racetracks and the virtual reality-centered Galaxy Pavilion that attracts adventure seekers with offerings that would be cutting edge on land, much less at sea. But the 2017 highlight that truly affirmed our financial success was our inclusion into the S&P 500. This is a remarkable achievement for a company less than five years removed from its initial public offering and is a testament to the stellar work and yeoman's efforts of our global team members both shoreside and at sea. In summary, 2017 was a solid and productive year with many milestones to be proud of, but more importantly, we have strategically positioned our company for continued strong performances in 2018 and beyond. I'll talk a little more about our positioning in my closing comments. But now, I'd like to hand the call over to Wendy for a commentary on 2017 results and 2018 expectations. Wendy? Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2017 and 2016 adjusted net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full year results, followed by color on booking trends and then, we'll close with our outlook and guidance for 2018. I'm pleased to report yet another record quarter, with both fourth quarter revenue and earnings the highest in our history. Results for the quarter exceeded expectations by $0.06, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, surpassing guidance of approximately $0.62. Better-than-expected results in core operations contributed to half the beat, with the other half coming from a one-time tax benefit as a result of the recent tax legislation. Adjusted net yield increased 3.4% or 3.9% on an as-reported basis versus the prior year, outperforming guidance expectations of up 2.25%, driven by strong close-in demand, coupled with continued strength in all onboard revenue streams. Excluding the impact from our new Norwegian brand capacity, which is dilutive to the NCLH corporate average, our fourth quarter adjusted net yield growth would have been approximately 6%. Looking at cost, adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, increased 2.8% versus prior year and 3.2% on an as-reported basis, primarily due to an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses as well as direct expenses in marketing initiatives related to the hurricanes and the technical issue on Norwegian Gem that we discussed on our last earnings call. Turning to fuel, our fuel expense per metric ton, net of hedges, slightly increased to $460 from $459 in the prior year. The increase in our fuel price per metric ton was unfavorable versus guidance, primarily due to rising prices since our last earnings call. Taking a look below the line, interest expense, net, was $84.3 million in 2017 compared to $88 million in 2016. In connection with refinancings of our senior notes and certain of our credit facilities, interest expense, net, included losses on extinguishment of debt and debt modification costs of $23.9 million in 2017 and $28.1 million in 2016. Turning to full-year results, 2017 finished strong and we delivered yet another year of record financial performance despite the headwinds from the unprecedented hurricane season, which impacted both the third and fourth quarters. Both revenue and earnings were the highest in our history and we achieved a record gross adjusted EBITDA margin in excess of 30%. Continued strong demand for our portfolio of products drove the beat to guidance with full-year adjusted earnings per share growing 16% to $3.96, $0.06 above guidance issued in November and $0.16 above the midpoint of our initial full-year guidance issued last February. Revenue grew approximately 11% over prior year, reaching a record $5.4 billion. Other key financial metrics for full-year 2017 include adjusted net yield growth of 5% or 4.8% on an as-reported basis, exceeding the midpoint of our most recent guidance by 25 basis points. The year benefited from the strong rebound in demand for Europe sailings, the addition of sailings to Cuba, strong close-in demand in core markets and stronger-than-expected onboard revenue. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, increased 2.8% or 2.9% on an as-reported basis and fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, decreased slightly to $465 from $466 in the prior year. Now, shifting the focus to 2018, on a full-year basis, our capacity is expected to increase approximately 8.8% with the midyear introduction of Norwegian Bliss, along with the annualization of Norwegian Joy. Looking at deployment around the world, we believe we have an optimal mix of itineraries for 2018. The Caribbean will comprise 37% of our deployment, with capacity in the region up high-single digits from prior year, primarily driven by Norwegian Sun, which will begin weekly sailings to Cuba in May. Europe will comprise 20% of our deployment with capacity down low-single digits from prior year, primarily as a result of dry dock timing and the trending of capacity in the lower-yielding shoulder season. The Asia, Africa and Pacific region will experience an increase in capacity with deployment mix increasing from 8% to 12%. As for other markets, deployment is similar year-over-year. Turning to the first quarter of 2018, capacity is expected to increase approximately 11%, primarily due to the annualization of Norwegian Joy and fewer dry docks in the period versus prior year. As for deployment for the first quarter, approximately 58% is allocated to the Caribbean, down slightly from prior year. Europe represents approximately 4%, in line with prior year. And the Asia, Africa, Pacific region accounts for approximately 17%, up from 9% in the prior year. Turning to guidance, strong booking trends have continued across all core markets for all three brands. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.45 to $4.65. Since our last earnings call, we have experienced a sizable increase in both fuel prices and interest rates, which has been partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates, resulting in a net headwind of $0.06 per share. Despite this headwind, we expect to grow earnings at least 15% in 2018, an improvement of $0.59 over prior year based on the midpoint of guidance. Adjusted net yield for the year is expected to increase approximately 2% or 2.75% on an as-reported basis. This performance is on top of the already robust 5% growth we delivered in 2017, which was bolstered by the aforementioned strong turnaround in Europe and the inaugural season of premium-priced sailings to Cuba, both of which we lap in 2018. Excluding new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand, adjusted net yield growth would have grown an additional 100 basis points to approximately 3% or 3.75% on an as-reported basis, which illustrates the pricing strength Frank referred to earlier of our core fleet. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be flat to up 1% or 0.5% to 1.5% on an as-reported basis, primarily due to an increase in dry dock days versus prior year. Without these incremental dry dock days, cost would have been down. As we mentioned last quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind for the balance of 2018. When looking at our NCLH corporate yield growth, keep in mind that yields for the first half of 2018 will naturally be lower than the second half as we lap the final quarters of the inaugural year of the high yielding Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Cruises' Sirena. In addition, the first half of 2018 will include the lower-yielding shoulder season of Norwegian Joy. As for cost, 2018 is the last year of heavy lifting for the Norwegian Edge and the Regent Seven Seas revitalization programs. As a result, scheduled dry dock days will roughly double versus the prior year, primarily due to these longer, more extensive dry docks. The majority of the year-over-year variance will impact the second quarter, resulting in a spike in adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, which is expected to be up high-single digits in the quarter. Costs for the back half of 2018 are expected to be flat, as we lap one-time expenses from the prior year related to the hurricanes and costs associated with the launch of our China operations. Turning to guidance for the first quarter, adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 0.5% or 1.25% on an as-reported basis. Keep in mind that Q1 not only has a tough year-over-year comparison with prior year growth of 5.5%, but also includes the lower-yielding shoulder season for Norwegian Joy as well as the extended scheduled dry dock of one of the higher-yielding ships in our fleet, Seven Seas Mariner. These items combined make this quarter the lowest expected yield growth quarter in 2018. Excluding new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand, which is dilutive to the NCLH corporate average yield, adjusted net yield is expected to be up 3.5%, further demonstrating the core pricing strength of our three brands. Turning to cost, adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be down approximately 2.75% or 1.75% on an as-reported basis, primarily due to the timing of dry docks with two scheduled dry docks occurring in the first quarter compared to five in the prior year. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $450, with expected consumption of approximately 205,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $0.52. As previously discussed, we continue to further strengthen our balance sheet and will meaningfully de-lever this year, bringing our expected leverage to the low 3 times. We remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. We are evaluating the best options to return capital to our shareholders, including the potential implementation of a dividend program and opportunistic share repurchases. Embedded in our full-year guidance, we have assumed the utilization of the remaining balance of our currently authorized share repurchase program to help mitigate the anticipated dilutive effects of equity awards. With that, I'll turn over the call back to Frank for closing remarks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Wendy. Operationally, we are now in the homestretch of preparing for the arrival of our 26th ship, Norwegian Bliss. She has maintained throughout her booking curve the fast-paced sales momentum and high pricing that has made her the best-booked newbuild in Norwegian's history. She has more cabins sold today at meaningfully higher prices than any of her sister ships at this point prior to delivery by a wide margin. Some would say that the best-booked ship in Norwegian's history is worthy of an encore and that is exactly what our newbuild slated for delivery at the tail-end of 2019 will be. Last month, we cut steel on the last of Norwegian's game-changing Breakaway Plus Class fleet with Norwegian Encore. She will be deployed to fully leverage the strong secular booking environment that we are seeing in North America, launching with sailings of the Caribbean from PortMiami in mid-December of 2019. A strong worldwide booking environment underpins our financial priorities for 2018 of achieving another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, de-levering to the low 3 times and preparing our balance sheet for the return of capital to shareholders, including the potential for the institution of a dividend. As I stated at the beginning of this call, I have never been more excited or energized going into a new year as I am today for 2018. Among the things I am most excited about is showing off the highly anticipated Norwegian Bliss. Her first call in the U.S. will be in the Big Apple in early May, where we will take the opportunity to showcase her to you with an Investor Day on Norwegian Bliss on May 4. As a result of the timing of our Investor Day, our first quarter earnings conference call is scheduled for May 2. We look forward to speaking with you then and seeing you onboard Norwegian Bliss. Mr. Jonathan, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your question, please. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Frank, just looking at the outlook for the year, a lot of investors that I'd spoke with this morning thought your full-year net yield guidance is conservative and your prepared remarks were definitely optimistic. So, as you think about that 2% increase for 2018, can you just help us understand what regions and brands would be the most prime to drive upside to your guidance, and then alternatively, where you might be holding back, given what you're seeing today? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Oh, we don't hold back, Felicia. We give you our best view based on the current situation. And please note, it's very early in the year. Look what happened in 2017. Who would have guessed that late in the year, after a very benign year, that weather events would cause the havoc that it did. And so, we take those situations under consideration, but looking at the numbers, we said that each of our brands is performing extremely well, both in load and in pricing. We don't see weakness in any of our source markets. We don't see weakness in any of our core markets, source or itineraries. Remember that we're lapping a couple of things from 2017. 2017 Europe performance was outstanding, following the issues that we all know about in 2016. The Cuba itineraries, as I said earlier in prior calls, were home runs and we continue to see high pricing for those itineraries, which is why we added a second vessel at the Norwegian brand, bringing our total capacity to Cuba to roughly 4%, double from 2017. But the year-over-year increase is not going to be as dramatic. We also have the full-year impact of Norwegian Joy, especially in the first half. It's the low season in China. And we have the lapping of our very, very high-yielding Oceania and Regent ships, Explorers and Sirena were introduced in 2016. So we have the conundrum of adding Bliss, which as I said earlier, the best booked in load, in pricing, in velocity, you name it, Bliss is leading the charge. But it comes from the Norwegian brand, which no matter how profitable these ships are, their yields are lower than the corporate average because of our unique mix in the industry of having roughly 30% of our capacity being very high priced, very high-yielding brands. So, you shouldn't take the 2% to be conservative. You shouldn't look the 2% to be anything other than a start for the year in which we have high hopes for, but it is still early. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And we're going to be strict with the one question rule, right, Andrea? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Go ahead. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wendy, just on your balance sheet, I know you guys have been working hard to get optimal leverage level and you talked about that, but you're kind of with, you're in your range, not at the low end, but you're there. Just, given that interest rates are rising, I was just wondering if you'd consider locking in some incremental debt now at current interest rate levels to buy back stock with the intent to offset dilution from potential future sponsor selling. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. Great question. And believe me, we have looked at all kinds of options. So first off, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have embedded in our 2018 guidance that we do plan to repurchase the $264 million in our authorization program. About half of that will help to offset dilution from equity growth and about half of that will be accretive. We'll continue to assess our options. As I also mentioned, we're keen on putting in a dividend program, potentially more repurchases. And regarding the interest rates, we will continue to fix our interest rates if we continue to bring on new capacity. So, we're right now about 54%-46%, but that will continue to grow more fixed. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Remember that in the fall, Felicia, we refinanced a good portion of our debt at the lowest rates that any company with our rating has ever achieved and really the rest of the debt that we have on the balance sheet is ship-related debt that is export credit agency-backed, which is so low you'd never want to refinance that debt. So, our balance sheet's capital structure is in very, very good shape and doesn't need a whole lot of tweaking. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your question, please. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. So, Frank, I guess if we look back at 2017, your initial yield guidance was I think 1.75% and you beat that by over 300 basis points. So, this is kind of a follow-up to Felicia's question, but I guess the question is what drove such a disconnect there between that initial yield guidance and where you ended up at the end of the year? Not sure if that was European demand or Cuba or what, but I guess what I'm trying to get at here again, is how could 2018 \u2013 could 2018 end up in a similar position, not beating by such a large margin, given some of the mix headwinds, but could there be a decent amount of upside to your initial range here? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We hope so, but we don't know yet. And as I said earlier, we give you our best read based on the timing of the year. I mean, if this was our fourth quarter call in November sometime, I'd have more data points underneath our belt, but a lot of things could happen between now and then. We are enthused, as I said, more so than we ever have and it's not just me, it's the entire management team. We have less inventory to sell than we've ever had before. The pricing we're getting across the board is very, very strong, but as I've mentioned in my comments to Felicia, last year, we had some unique situations with Cuba, with Europe making an incredible rebound year-over-year. Who was going to expect that? 2017, the momentum really grew and grew and grew and it wasn't until the hurricanes hit in mid-September that we had any bump on the road. And so, you tell me how many bumps in the road we're going to have and I'll tell you by how much we can possibly beat our guidance. But we do take those situations into account and if business continues the way it's been and there are no bumps on the road, then I think we could have some very pleasant surprises down the road, but until that happens, we hesitate to comment on it. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, second question, I'll try to ask this as nicely as I can, but with the transition with Wendy unfortunately leaving the company later this year, I guess, the question is where does that search stand, Frank, and maybe help us think about what you're ultimately looking for in her replacement? I guess what I'm getting at is, is this person, whoever that may be, could we think of this person as a possible replacement for you whenever you decide to step aside? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. So, we underwent a pretty thorough succession plan review, top to bottom, in the company and feel very, very good about our senior leadership management team, where they stand and what back-ups there could be. In the case of Wendy, we're going to engage \u2013 we have engaged a nationally recognized firm to look for a top-notch leader that can certainly walk in and be a very effective CFO and someone who, in the three years or so that I have until my contract expires at the end of 2020, can compete for the CEO job. We have several internal candidates who will also hopefully be competing for that CEO job, but having more options from a corporate governance perspective is better than having fewer. And so, we look forward to this person being a top-notch CEO and someone who can compete for the CEO job at the appropriate time. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Great color. Appreciate it. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Your question, please. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. You noted all of the regions were \"strong\" as you look out into the future. I'm wondering perhaps if you can give us a little bit more color or ranking as far as what ones are very strong and which ones are only so-so strong, so to speak. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Even the guy who bats ninth for the Yankees when the Yankees were good was a good hitter. And that's what we've got here. We've got a lineup that I see no underperforming regions. I'm always looking where to move vessels to. Cruise lines seek to move vessels to the highest yielding destinations. That's why ships have propellers and rudders and today, it's one of those few times in my tenure in the 25 years I've been in the industry that I wouldn't move any of my ships. I like where they are. I think, as we said in our prepared statements, we have optimum itineraries and I think that's one of the reasons we're seeing the strong pricing that we're seeing is because they're in the right place at the right times. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question, please. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. And thank you on the color so far. I'll follow Felicia's lead and take two shots here. One, Wendy, if you could just remind us by the end of 2018, where your mix of fixed to floating will be inclusive of swaps and then, the overall what you have locked in on the committed financings for the seven newbuilds that you have on order? And then, the second question would be on China, Frank, how did everything perform in 2017? If you can kind of back out Korea, how did everything perform versus your expectations? And then, at this point, where do you see the potential for bringing a second ship to China, now that you've got Encore committed to the Caribbean? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: You managed to squeeze five questions in, Tim. I'll take China first. Look, China was profitable for us in 2017. We said she would be and she delivered. There are still challenges in China. I don't think China is hitting on all cylinders like it can and still we remain committed. We remain optimistic that the areas of opportunity, the areas that we can improve upon will come to fruition. One of those is South Korea. You've heard me say many times, Tim, that the leading \u2013 the most important variable in increasing yields is itinerary. And when you only have one country to go to on four or five-day cruises, that's what's popular in China, it's difficult to have itinerary optimization. So, I think once South Korea comes back and we're all hopeful it comes back sooner than later, I think that will help things. Second thing that keeps me optimistic about China, at least in the short to medium term is that, for the first time, I think, ever, China is not going to experience double-digit or even triple-digit year-over-year capacity growth. For the most part, capacity is either flattish or slightly down, which should benefit those who have remained and we're one of those. And so, we're optimistic that that will continue. And as far as what will it take to bring another ship to China, quite frankly the rest of the world is doing so well to Patrick's question a moment ago, that it's hard to pull a vessel when you only have 26 ships, like we do, into China. We have many other either unserved or underserved markets that we would also consider in the mix, should ships become available to us. We don't have a presence in the mid-Atlantic states. We're not in Baltimore. We're not in Charleston. We don't have a presence at all in the world's second largest port, which is Fort Lauderdale. We don't have a presence in the Gulf States of Texas or Alabama. We don't have a year-round presence in Tampa or New Orleans or in Los Angeles. We only have three ships in Alaska, which is a very high-yielding market. Some of our competitors have up to eight vessels. So, given our fleet size today and the fact that we will only be taking one ship per year, it could be a couple of years before we consider adding more tonnage to China, if the conditions in the rest of the world remain as robust as they are today. And with that, I'll turn it over to \u2013 Mark, I think, will take this question about your debt question. Mark Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes, I think, Tim, if I recall after the five questions, I think you were asking what our committed CapEx is for the next three years in associated financing. So, we have about $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion for the next three years of roughly which 50% of each of those years is we have committed financing in place. And I think the first part of your question was on fuel hedges, if I recall? Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, it was related to the debt. Where do you see the... Mark Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We have \u2013 about 55% of our debt is fixed and 46% is floating. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Where will that be, Mark, at year-end with swaps, I guess, was the question. Mark Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, that's going to be about 40% by year-end. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Mark Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We'll take on the fixed debt with the delivery of the Bliss and that will continue to work down as we take on further deliveries. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks. Another couple follow-ups on net yield and forward booking comments. What percentage of the year is currently booked? How much of a swing factor could close-in bookings be on net yield, given some of your comments on potentially seeing bigger swings recently in the close-in bookings? And does the guidance embed growth in the close-in booking pricing or is it just based on what's currently on the books? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: What's currently on the books, we don't give out. We don't disclose what our booking position is in terms of occupancy. I will tell you that the only time we do is at year-end and I will tell you that the turns at year-end, very, very close to our target of being sold 60% at year-end. And so, as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, the velocity of bookings during the first seven weeks of wave have grown year-over-year and so that advantage, if you will, at year-end from both in loading and pricing has further improved. So, look, we don't need any home runs in order to hit our target. It's pretty much steady as she goes and hopefully if the environment remains how it is today, it could even be better. And also, there is always the \u2013 in terms of yields, the variable is always onboard revenue. It doesn't happen until it happens. So, we don't have the same visibility on onboard revenue, which is a very important and significant component of overall yields. We don't have the same visibility on onboard as we do on load or on ticket pricing. I will tell you, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we see a direct correlation between when you have high ticket pricing, you also see high onboard revenue. Customers, who have money to spend on tickets, have money to spend onboard and we've been seeing it throughout 2017 and expect to continue seeing it in 2018. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. So, maybe a quick follow-up on the onboard comments. Is there anything that you can call out as you look at the mix of onboard spending and the strength that you've seen there that would give you a sense for how 2018 is shaping up? And any color on \u2013 it looks like your onboard expenses were particularly well-managed. Anything going on there that we should think through for the next couple of years? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No. When folks have money to spend onboard, they spend it in restaurants and in shops and, primarily, in shore excursions. We've seen this widespread move away from buying things to enjoying experiences. So, we've seen a nice uptick in our shore excursion business. Our casino business has always been strong. And so, again, you see this onboard general strength across the various onboard revenue streams that we have available. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Good luck this year. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Your question, please. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Obviously, a lot of the conversation has been about yields and I think rightfully so. It was a fantastic year with respect to yields, but I wanted to talk about costs a little bit. Obviously, you started the year guiding to about 1%. It was about 2.8%, I think, is where we finished. It's not really the norm for you or the industry in terms of cost inflation. That said, I'm really encouraged by the cost guidance for 2018. So, I guess two things here. What gives you confidence that we won't see more cost creep over the course of 2018 like we did in 2017? And, if at all possible, is there any way to quantify sort of the Edge refurbishment impact here, particularly as we look forward to 2019? It seems like a lot of those costs will be falling off. Trying to figure out what type of a benefit we should see beyond this year. Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. So, a good question. First off, there's about $25 million of one-time expenses that we will be rolling over 2018 versus 2017. And when you parse that back, there's China start-up costs; there was additional marketing for both China and Cuba, of which some of that will continue; there were a number of expenses related to the unprecedented hurricane season; and we also had the Gem technical issue. So, if you look at the back half of 2018 where we're lapping that $25 million, that's approximately 125 basis points that we'll get the benefit of in 2018. And for that reason, the back half of 2018 will basically be flat from a net cruise cost perspective. Now, for 2018, what's offsetting that is we have mentioned that we have incremental dry dock days in 2018, primarily related to these fleet enhancement programs. And we also have higher inaugural and launch-related expenses associated with the debut of Norwegian Bliss. So, keeping in mind that this is the first time we're having a North American ship in a couple of years, we are showing her off at four inaugural events. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And, James, just to pipe in on the 2019 comment you had, we are having more dry docks in 2018. Our run rate is going to be about 8 to 10 per year. And in 2019, we'll see that as well. But what's important to note is that we also have some of our larger ships going into dry dock for the first time in 2019. So, this is going to be our run rate going forward on, roughly 8 to 10 per year. James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura. Your question, please. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hi. Good morning and I apologize. I've been on another call, so I hope I'm not asking a question that's already been asked and answered. Have you gotten the question about investor worries with respect to supply growth and what steps you're taking to ensure that demand lifts well ahead of that? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No, you got lucky, Harry. No one's asked that yet, so. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : This is good. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I'll take it. I've been reading the analysts' reports, fielding investor calls the last few months on supply growth. And so think of it this way. For both 2017 and 2018, our brand has a higher capacity growth than the industry at large. And you can see that we have been able to introduce those vessels very nicely into our fleet, especially the Norwegian Bliss, with incredible high pricing, strong velocity of bookings. For 2019, which is the year that everybody seems to be concerned about, the Norwegian capacity growth is actually about half of the industry average. And as I noted earlier in another call, we have so many markets that are either unserved by us or grossly under-penetrated by us. From a Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings perspective, we simply have no concerns about the supply growth. We do compete in a global marketplace, but we see so many opportunities to deploy vessels to strong areas, especially in the North American market which is showing very strong secular indications for sustained growth, that we can't wait to get our hands on new vessels. So no, I'm not worried about it. For those of you who have not been in the industry for 25 years like I have, I've been seeing this question raised literally every year, that oh my God, oh my God, another ship is coming and all I know is that every ship is full at good prices. The industry makes plenty of money. We're resilient and I expect that to continue as we see a broader consumer base attracted to cruising. It's not just about the boomers anymore. Millennials are taking to cruising. This is not just a North American sport anymore. We have a very large footprint internationally and when I say we, I mean us, our brand and also our three brands and also the industry at large, excluding China. And so the capacity growth, even though it is slightly higher than the long-term average, is not so high that it should cause any concerns, given the strength that we're seeing in the marketplace, the broad-based adoption by many markets to cruising. I simply don't have any concerns, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : And maybe another source of demand that you can touch on, Frank, would be the mix of customers who were, say, under 55 or 60. Has that mix been growing for you? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, in absolute terms, yes. Millennials now make up roughly a quarter of our customers. That certainly wasn't the case even five years ago. The boomers are still the biggest, but the fastest growing without question, by a wide margin, are millennials. And we love to see that. We're seeing it in, especially on our North American-sourced customers for our North American type of itineraries. So, we're glad to see it. We need to have another group of folks outside of the boomers. The boomers have been great to the cruise industry, don't get me wrong. The boomers built the cruise industry that we know today, but the millennials are making a strong push to be alongside them. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : That's great, Frank. Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you. We've got, operator, time for one more question. We're over a little bit, but one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of David Beckel from Bernstein Research. Your question, please. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks a lot and no pressure on the last question here. Just wanted to ask a little bit of a different question about onboard technology. Last quarter, you sort of teased an onboard technology release and in your press release this morning, there was mention of the Norwegian app. Is that the release that you were referring to last quarter, Frank? And if so, can you talk a little about what some of the improvements are to the onboard experience and maybe the associated cost? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. I'm going to have Andy Stuart, President and CEO of the Norwegian brand, answer that question, that he can do it a lot better than I can. Andy? Andrew Stuart - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi. Good morning. Yeah, the app that was referred to in the release is the next generation of the Cruise Norwegian app and we soft launched that in Q4 onboard Norwegian Sky. And we're pretty excited about it, because this is the first time we've really been able to connect the pre-cruise experience, the embarkation process, the onboard experience into one seamless piece of technology. And the soft launch was extremely successful, well-received by our guests. Of course, with any technology, you learn a little bit. So, we've incorporated those learnings into a new version of the app and we're in the process now of rolling that out for Norwegian Bliss. The Norwegian Bliss will launch with our guests having access to this new technology. And what it really allows is when guests book, they can immediately download the app, they can really plan their whole trip. So, they can book shore excursions. They can book dining. They can book entertainment, just to name some of things they can do on the app. Once they get to embarkation, it then delivers mobile, online and paperless check-in. So, really enhances the experience of that we all want to go as quickly as possible getting onboard the ship. And then, onboard, it brings to life everything that's happened in the pre-planning process. It keeps guests up-to-date with all the onboard activities, messaging between guests and it is really a meaningful enhancement to planning, embarkation and onboard experience. So, we're very happy with how it was received on Sky. We're very \u2013 we're looking forward to launching it on Bliss and then we'll plan the rollout across the balance of the fleet. So, this has been a great step forward for us. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Andy, and thanks everyone for your time this morning and your support. As always, we will be available this afternoon to answer your questions and, again, I look forward to seeing you onboard Norwegian Bliss in New York. All the best. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide guidance for 2018 before turning the call back to Frank for some closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover just a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2018 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Today we are hosting our call from the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, where in about 24 hours the fabulous new Norwegian Bliss will make her maiden call in the United States. Her delivery two weeks ago marked not just the introduction of the latest flagship of the Norwegian Cruise Line fleet, but also the culmination of the best pre-booking period for a new build in the line's history. And we expect that her inaugural activities in Southampton England; New York City this weekend; and in Miami, Los Angeles and Seattle, which incidentally make up the line's most comprehensive inaugural event in our history, will further stoke demand for her sailings in Alaska, the West Coast and the Eastern Caribbean from Miami, starting this fall. The buildup and successful launch of Norwegian Bliss embodies all that our team, not just the Norwegian Cruise Line, but also those at Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises have been working fervently to instill in our brand and message to the marketplace, that of choice, quality, value and innovative on-boarding shore-side activities resulting in the ultimate cruise vacation experience. Our three brands focus on offering our target market sailings to the destinations they want to visit most on state-of-the-art vessels that are consistently refreshed to prevailing tastes and to the highest standards. As part of our unique go-to-market strategy, our brands offer the absolute best value at the time voyages first open for sale. In other words, at the inception of each sailing's booking curve. This can mean offering the best price in the case of the all inclusive Regent brand or including the most valuable choices from the many Free at Sea offerings on the Norwegian brand. Because our ultimate goal is to deliver exciting, fun and memorable vacation experiences that will make guests loyal repeat customers, while delivering best-in-class financial results for our shareholders. Norwegian Bliss has wildly succeeded in these first three pillars. All that is left to do which is what Norwegian does best, is to deliver its unique onboard experiences centered around freedom and flexibility that no other cruise line can come close to replicating. In the case of Bliss, we achieved this goal with the most attractive offering of onboard activities, amenities and venues ever seen on a Norwegian ship. But most importantly, we accomplished this with a passionate and dedicated crew that is anxiously waiting to welcome and graciously serve each and every guest. From Bliss's stylish observation lounge perfect for viewing Alaska's stunning natural scenery to world class entertainment, which includes Broadway favorite Jersey Boys and from a North American debut of the top of the ship 1,000 foot long Go Kart race track to our first upscale smokehouse restaurant Q, Bliss will certainly make lasting impressions on the most discerning of guests. As I stated earlier, Norwegian Bliss enters the fleet as the best booked new build in Norwegian's history. Her success exemplifies the strong worldwide demand for cruising that has been experienced across our brands. After entering this year's wave season with the highest load factors and highest pricing in the company's history, the sustained strength in global demand that we've come to expect across our three brands has continued, which together with our bundling strategy and the precise execution of our market-to-fill strategy has resulted in pricing and occupancy for the balance of 2018 and through 2019 sailings continuing to be meaningfully ahead of same time last year levels. This is true across all major deployments and particularly in our premium price deployments of Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, Alaska, Hawaii and Cuba. Even our Caribbean and Bahamas sailings through this year's second through fourth quarters and continuing through the first half of 2019 are showing with very few isolated exceptions, year-over-year improvement in pricing and load. Of particular interest is our Eastern Caribbean sailings, which resume operations again in the fourth quarter after a hiatus in the second and third quarters. Bookings and pricing for fourth quarter 2018 and first half 2019 sailings are better booked when compared to similar cruises during the same time last year. Looking further ahead, I'd like to discuss two points that demonstrate the strong continuation of the booking environment that first began in late 2016, continued throughout 2017, and is alive and well year-to-date. First, while still early in the booking cycle, I'd like to reiterate that 2019 is shaping up very well with full year occupancy and pricing at each of our three brands above the record levels we experienced during the same time last year. Second, in mid-April Regent Seven Seas Cruises set an all-time single day booking record when the brand released for sale their first set of voyages of its first quarter 2020 introduction of Seven Seas Splendor. Booking volume exceeded the previous record which was set three years ago when Splendor's sister ship Seven Seas Explorer opened for sale by over 30%. But most importantly it is worth noting that Splendor's first sailing is not until January 2020, close to two years from now. And this boost in first day booking increases our confidence that we have yet another stellar ship in our hands with Splendor. The strength in demand for sailings further and further in the future underscores the strength of our booking curve and reinforces my view on the macroeconomic trends that I have held for many years. Today there is a heightened level of chatter among some investors about the possible impact from the rising risk of a near term recession coupled with known increases in the supply growth. I've always believed that market analysts and government watchdogs should consider the cruise industry's booking curve as a leading economic indicator because of the extended timeframe and future visibility of consumer confidence that cruise sales represent. Today we want to confidently tell you that we do not see any evidence of recessionary pressures on demand or on pricing as a result of global or domestic macroeconomic conditions or that the increase in supply growth coming online over the next few years is causing any disruptions in the marketplace. During each of the past two years business has improved each year. And at this juncture it looks like 2019 will improve as well. Our strong operating results reflect that we are an active participant in this stronger for longer secular trend. But perhaps the best news is that there is still room for improvement to continue building upon this strong demand environment. Several catalysts can drive consumer cruise demand even higher. Some of these factors we control, while others are purely external. One of the main external factors is full access to some old favorite and desirable destinations that have been off-limits for a while. For example, some areas of the Eastern Mediterranean are for the most part still effectively closed to cruising and we are eager to see Turkey and its historic cities of Istanbul and Ku\u015fadas\u0131 and sailings to certain Black Sea destinations along with Egypt and the Holy Land return to our Mediterranean itinerary in a meaningful way. There are also infrastructure issues that affect capacity deployments, which when improved will fuel additional demand. Havana for example is severely limited in its ability to service current demand. We began sailing to Cuba a little over a year ago and in that short time Havana has skyrocketed to become the most popular port of call among our high volume destinations, while becoming the latest addition to our portfolio of premium price destinations. Fortunately, we have worked extremely hard to gain additional calls to this extremely popular and high yielding port of call. We remain both committed and hopeful that infrastructure improvements will occur soon allowing us to bring additional and larger ships to this most sought-after destination. And lastly there's Alaska, where several important ports such as Ketchikan and Skagway are looking to increase cruise capacity hopefully resulting in additional and larger ships being able to bring more and more guests to Alaska's pristine waters. Internally, the go-to-market initiatives we've recently launched for our China source business could result if successful in meaningful pricing and onboard revenue improvement. With a relatively small and nimble fleet, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is uniquely positioned to benefit from these underserved high potential destinations as ports and regions either reopen or increase their capacity to further enhance our already outsized offerings of premium price deployments. Premium price deployments command commensurate premium hardware in order to optimize pricing. 2018 marks the winding down of two significant fleet enhancement programs that have transformed the fleets of Norwegian Cruise Line and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. The Norwegian Edge program elevated the experience across the Norwegian brand's fleet with enhancements to public areas, dining venues, staterooms and more. The heavy lifting for this program will essentially be completed in 2018, with only one major dry dock left in 2019 and one in 2020. After which every ship in the Norwegian fleet will be in like new condition. And the completion of the $125 million refurbishment program for Regent Seven Seas Navigator, Voyager and just last month for Mariner, have elevated the experience on these vessels to the level of the brand's current flagship Seven Seas Explorer. We firmly believe that these programs have greatly contributed to the record pricing and record repeat guest rates, the metric by which I truly measure guest satisfaction of these two brands. In the quarter just ended, it was a stellar performance of all three of our brands that drove our record results. To go over these results in more detail, I'll turn the call over now to Mark Kempa. After which I will return with some closing comments. Mark? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2018 and 2017 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our first quarter results, followed by color on booking trends, and then will close with our outlook and guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018. I'm pleased to report yet another record quarter with both first quarter revenue and earnings the highest in our history. Results for the quarter exceeded expectations by $0.08 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 surpassing guidance of approximately $0.52. Better than expected performance in the topline contributed $0.03 of the beat and $0.02 was due to timing of certain expenses, partially offset by an increase in fuel expense with the remainder coming from our other income expense line as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Net yield increased 1% or 2% on an as reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations above 0.5%. The beat was driven by strong and well priced close-in demand coupled with continued strength in all onboard revenue streams. Excluding the impact from our new Norwegian brand capacity, which is dilutive to the NCLH corporate average yield, our first quarter net yield growth would have been over 4%. Looking at costs; adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel decreased 2.7% versus prior year and 2.1% on an as reported basis as a result of fewer dry docks and better cost control in the period. Turning to fuel; our fuel expense per metric ton, net of hedges, decreased to $448 from $453 in the prior year. Taking a look at below the line, interest expense net was $59.7 million in 2018 compared to $53 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense reflects additional debt in connection with the delivery of Norwegian Joy in April 2017, Project Leonardo financing, as well as higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR, partially offset by the benefit from the full redemption in October of 2017 of our 4.625% senior notes due 2020. Now shifting focus to the second quarter. Our capacity is expected to increase approximately 9%, primarily due to the annualization of Norwegian Joy and the introduction of Norwegian Bliss in the quarter with her first regularly scheduled revenue sailing commencing in early June. As for deployment for the second quarter, approximately 24% is allocated to the Caribbean, which includes the Bahamas and Cuba, and is down slightly from the prior year. We do not have sailings to the Eastern Caribbean during the second or third quarter as we redesigned those itineraries during Q4 of last year to Western Caribbean sailings as a result of the impacts from last year's hurricanes. These new itineraries also allowed us to take advantage of our newly developed private destination Harvest Caye, which is one of our highest rated ports in terms of guest satisfaction. Before moving on to the balance of Q2 deployment, I'll touch on our third quarter Caribbean capacity. Approximately 18% of our capacity is allocated to the Caribbean which includes the Bahamas and Cuba during the shoulder season. And while our third quarter capacity to the region is up double digits during the quarter, this is primarily driven by the addition of Norwegian Sun, our second Norwegian branded ship, sailing to Havana from Port Canaveral beginning this month. Turning back to Q2 deployment; Europe represents approximately 25%, down from the prior year due to several dry docks early in the quarter associated with the Norwegian Edge program. The Asia, Africa, Pacific region accounts for approximately 11%, up from 3% in the prior year as a result of the addition of Norwegian Joy to the fleet. As for other key markets, Alaska accounts for approximately 9%; Bermuda approximately 11%; and Hawaii approximately 4% of our total deployment. Turning to expectations for the second quarter. Despite rolling over impressive year-over-year net yield growth of 8.1%, as well as the expected impact of the lower yielding shoulder season for Norwegian Joy in China, net yield is expected to increase approximately 2% or 2.75% on an as reported basis. Excluding the effect of new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand which is dilutive to the NCLA corporate average yield, net yield is expected to be up approximately 4.25% during the second quarter further demonstrating the core pricing strength of all our brands. Turning to costs; adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up 7.5% to 8% or approximately 9% on an as reported basis, primarily due to a large year-over-year increase in dry dock days in the quarter as a result of extended dry docks for the Norwegian Edge fleet enhancement program, and inaugural and launch expenses associated with the introduction of Norwegian Bliss which are higher than previous ship introductions as it's the first ship we've launched in North America since 2015. We are very excited to showcase her in four major cities around the country : New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Seattle. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $470 with expected consumption of approximately 205,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $1.02, flat to the prior year, primarily as a result of the higher dry dock days associated with our Norwegian Edge fleet enhancement program. As for the full year, strong booking trends across all core markets for all three brands have resulted in the raising of our outlook for net yield growth by 50 basis points and is now expected to be up approximately 2.5% or 3% on an as reported basis. Excluding new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand, net yield is expected to be up approximately 3.5% or 100 basis points higher, which further illustrates the pricing strength of our core fleet. Turning to costs; adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be flat to 1% or up 0.5% to 1.5% on an as reported basis consistent with our prior guidance. Looking at fuel expense. Our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges is now expected to be at $470 with expected consumption of approximately 840,000 metric tons. Strong and well priced close-in demand in the first quarter coupled with higher expectations for the remainder of the year has resulted in an increase to top line expectations. In addition, rising fuel prices negatively impacted earnings guidance. Despite this headwind we have raised our EPS outlook by $0.08 at the midpoint, expanding the high end and moving up the floor of our guidance range. As a result, full year adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.70. There are a few items to keep in mind for the balance of 2018. The back half of the year will have higher yield growth versus the first half as a result of easier comparisons with the third quarter having the highest growth. As for costs, the back half of 2018 is expected to be down as we lap one-time expenses from the prior year related to the hurricanes and costs associated with the launch of our China operations. During the quarter, we executed on a few initiatives to reduce interest expense and further strengthen the balance sheet. First, we redeemed $135 million of our 4.75% senior notes due 2021. Following the partial redemption, $565 million remains outstanding. In addition, we recently entered into forward interest rate swaps for $1 billion of our variable rate debt for the remainder of 2018 and through the end of 2019 to lock in favorable rates, which increases our fixed rate debt to approximately 71% in 2018 and 75% in 2019. Thereafter our fixed rate debt percentage will be approximately 70% as we take delivery of our new builds, which have very efficient fixed rate financing in place. As for leverage we remain on track to delever to the low three times by year end. We remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. And as our balance sheet continues to strengthen in combination with strong financial performance, we will pivot to providing meaningful capital returns to our shareholders. As part of that strategy, we recently announced a $1 billion three-year share repurchase program that will enable us to opportunistically buy back shares. We will discuss this topic more at our Investor Day later this week. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing remarks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Mark. The delivery of a new flagship vessel is always an exciting time. And just as exciting is the addition of a new flagship terminal. We recently announced plans to construct a new dedicated terminal at PortMiami, the cruising capital of the world. Last week, our executives and members of Miami-Dade County government and PortMiami joined together to break ground on what will be an iconic structure in the city that has been home to Norwegian Cruise Line for over 50 years. With the capacity to handle over 5,000 guests, the terminal will serve to welcome over 1 million passengers that board our ships in Miami annually. Construction of the terminal is slated for completion in time to welcome the next ship in Norwegian's fleet Norwegian Encore in November of 2019. It will be a fitting welcome to have a brand new terminal to inaugurate the final ship in the wildly successful Breakaway Plus class. These ships were revolutionary when introduced and continue to be extremely popular with new and repeat guests alike. We have set the bar high with Norwegian Bliss, but we are confident that Norwegian Encore will be the ultimate Breakaway class ship. With new terminals and ship additions are indeed exciting, perhaps what excites me most is taking note of where we are today in Norwegian's path to returning capital to shareholders. We are rapidly reaching an inflection point as our stellar operating results, shrewd investments in our fleet, strategic acquisitions, disciplined financial stewardship, and deleveraging profile have all coalesced to position us to further solidify and accelerate our plans to return meaningful capital to shareholders. As Mark mentioned, we'll discuss our capital allocation plans along with our strategies for driving demand to maximize the benefits of our growth profile at our Investor Day this coming Friday aboard Norwegian Bliss. We look forward to welcome you to what will surely be an exciting and informative event. And with that, I'll turn the call over to questions. Operator, please? Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is now open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning and thank you. Hey, Mark, good morning. I just want to make sure that we're interpreting your guidance for net yields correctly. So based on the first quarter upside and your new 2Q guidance and your revised 2018 net yield guidance, it appears that you raised your second half net yields by something like 20 basis points. Is that right? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Thanks, Felicia. Yes, we did raise our yield guidance for the balance of the year. And that's despite FX headwinds in the top line. The beat in Q1 was really from \u2013 we rolled over the beat in Q1, I should say, and then we raised the outlook for the year and it was driven by strong demand across all three brands. We're in a better book position and we just have a lot more visibility and confidence in the outlook. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just on the fourth quarter, and maybe Frank, this is for you. I believe, you said in your prepared remarks, and you've said this before that you're bringing ships back to the Eastern Caribbean. So does that mean that the second half net yield guidance that we just talked about doesn't just reflect your optimism about this, the Western Caribbean, but also about the Eastern Caribbean, generally? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, that's about right, Felicia. The Eastern Caribbean comes back to our fleet in fourth quarter, and it is performing better in both load and pricing as it did this time last year. And remember that this time last year the hurricanes hadn't occurred yet. So, we're very pleased with the way the Eastern Caribbean has come back in Q4. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is now open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. I think, there is so many data points you've given us to kind of refute the fare supply case. So maybe my question will be on the sort of this other part of this debate about the Caribbean pricing. I think, one of the things that can sometimes be misinterpreted is that if people are looking at price now versus price at the same time last year for that fall Caribbean that those April of 2017 prices aren't really where those fall Caribbean cruises ended up. So I wonder if you could quantify in any way when you look at what you have on the books now even for those \u2013 you mentioned, some isolated parts of Caribbean and Bahamas that they are \u2013 where some of the price may be down versus the same time last year. But is it fair to say that where those are pricing today is ahead of where those prices ended up last year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. So the prices today compared to where the prices were last year is a tougher comparison because whatever erosion there was on price after the hurricane had not yet occurred. So the answer to your question is yes. Today's prices for the Eastern Caribbean in Q4 are better than they were same time last year and certainly better where they ended. And to the point about the \u2013 your second point about the three and four day cruises, I'll turn that over to Andy who's got a better handle on that. Andrew Stuart - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Good morning, Robin. I thought it might be useful to exclude Cuba, just because Cuba is a unique destination and premium pricing. So if you look at Caribbean pricing and load over the next 12 months, we are ahead on pricing and load factor. So, quite frankly, we're feeling pretty good about the region. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is now open. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey. Good morning, guys. So, if you look at \u2013 Frank, you gave a lot of good commentary around 2019 and some pretty healthy commentary around what you're seeing there right now. I guess, based on what you're seeing today in the marketplace and kind of your booking activity, is it fair to say that when we look out to next year, you would expect yields to continue to grow similar to what you would characterize as a normal year? And I know you might not want to answer that directly, but any high level commentary would be helpful given the amount of supply growth that's going to come in next year. And I think that's a pretty big concern right now for a lot of investors. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. We're going to talk a lot about this at Investor Day on Friday, Steve. But I can tell you that remember 2019 is primarily an organic year for us with Norwegian Encore not coming online until very late in the year, middle of November. But as I look at the core business today how is it shaping up for 2019? Should we be optimistic? And the answer is yes. Across all segments the business is ahead of this time last year. Remember this time last year for 2017, it was fantastic. Record bookings for 2017. Everybody was very giddy about what was going to happen in 2017. And 2017 turned out to be a record year in the industry despite what happened in September with the hurricane. So the fact that we are ahead today in both load and in pricing should under normal circumstances dispel any kind of concern that there may be in the marketplace about the industry's ability to absorb capacity, the industry's ability to bounce back after the hurricanes, sustained growth in our European business. All those myths and that's what they are, myths should be dispelled by not only our commentary, but those of our peers in the industry. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Got you. That's great color and that's helpful. And then Frank, can you talk about maybe the bundling strategy and how that is coming together and how that's working for you guys? I think there's also a little bit of a misconception out there in the marketplace about how that's going to impact ticket prices, impact onboard in terms of your yields? And if you can give some color around that that might be helpful as well? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: I'm going to give you a rainbow of colors on that on Friday at the Investor Day. But for this purpose, I will tell you that we consider our bundling strategy to be a competitive advantage and you'll clearly see what I mean by that on Friday. We've begun rolling it out to other markets, international markets in Europe, we started rolling it out this winter in China and the preliminary results are very promising. We see an extension of the booking curve. We see higher ticket pricing as a result of it and we've begun seeing better onboard spend as well. So it's something that is core to our go-to-market strategy and something we'll continue to do. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. See you on Friday. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is now open. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to just ask a quick technical question for Mark. Do you need to pay down any debt or any significant amounts of debt to get to your low 3x leverage target? Or is that mostly EBITDA driven? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. That's primarily EBITDA driven. Any debt repayment that we've \u2013 that we completed that debt repayment at the latter \u2013 tail end of Q1, early part of Q2, and no, we have not contemplated any further to get to that target. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay, very good. And then a quick one for Frank. Just again focusing on the supply concerns because significant amount of the concerns are on not only 2019 supply, but also the third quarter Caribbean system supply. If you think about marketing expense, it seems to me that the industry as a whole is pivoting some of their marketing expense this far ahead of 2019. And if there were a significant amount of work yet to do to fill 2018 would the industry be doing that? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No. I think that's a good observation. So some of our brands began pivoting, if you will focusing on 2019 over 2018 in early March because that's how well they're booked for 2018. And others are just about to begin that pivot in the next week or so. The good news is that at least in our case we're not spending any more marketing dollars in total to the degree that there is more inventory to sell in 2019 and we will spend that money accordingly. But yes, I think that's another data point that should be encouraging to investors that the pivot to the following year's inventory is occurring certainly earlier than last year and perhaps earlier than ever. And that again at least in our case that we're not envisioning spending more. We're just spending it in a different time period. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : I got it. Thanks very much, guys. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question. Just piling on the list of investor concerns here. I think, another one would be certain new entrants that aren't public and don't have to abide necessarily by some of the same public disclosure rules, or I guess, its perceived discipline. As it relates to Caribbean entry from certain new competitors this year, how has their entry affected your revenue management strategy if at all? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Not at all. I think, I know, which entrant you might be referring to. And what we have seen is a very responsible way in which they have introduced their new hardware into the marketplace, again another data point that suggests that the overall health of the market and that of the Caribbean is strong enough to absorb a relatively new entrant with new hardware. And so we're not again seeing any disruptions in the marketplace, nothing that we or our peers in the public space have had to do to respond to an assault from a new entrant, if you will. It's pretty much business as usual. And we wouldn't be better booked at higher prices if that wasn't the case. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. And as a quick follow-up, just digging into your guidance a little bit for the rest of the year. Do you anticipate \u2013 does that guidance anticipate higher onboard spend? And if you could, could you sort of bifurcate the percentage growth between luxury and Norwegian brand? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. We don't segment report like those numbers. We will give you more color on Friday about our industry leading onboard revenue generation and we'll give you more color on that. But we saw strong first quarter onboard spending trends ex-China, so we're very happy with the onboard spend. It's another data point. Now one thing is the booking curve where people today feel confident enough to be booking their cruises a year or more further out. And a more current data point will be, well, what's happening today, what happened last week onboard your ships in terms of onboard revenue. And onboard revenue has been very, very strong throughout Q1 and I see it continuing so far into Q2. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Maybe one to change gears a little bit. I guess with IMO 2020 kind of moving to the horizon, I guess, what do you think about the impact of the new rules and regulations there? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, so that's something that's been on our minds for quite some time over the last few years. We are in the process of retrofitting our legacy fleet with scrubber technology. All of our new builds are going to be delivered with scrubbers in place. And right now, our best visibility in 2020 is that we'll have a mix change. Today, we burn roughly 70% HFO, 30% MGO. We anticipate that would probably go to somewhere around 40% HFO, 60% MGO. And just to give a little bit more context around that, we expect around 65% of our operational capacity in 2020 will have scrubber technology. And then thereafter we will in 2020 and 2021 we'll have additional capacity coming online. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And maybe a follow-up on that. Do you anticipate as you look at the broader industry fleet that some of the older ships could actually be effectively forced into retirement given the investment that will be required to become compliant? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No, I don't think so, Steve. We've spent quite a bit of money refurbishing our vessels. We have the youngest fleet in the industry, so we're not in that situation. We have a small fleet. We have many underserved markets. A preponderance of our deployments are to premium price destinations. One of the reasons why we lead the industry on a capacity day basis and EBITDA per berth. So, no, I don't see the price of fuel causing at least us any kind of accelerated retirements, not at all. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then maybe moving back to the forward bookings, you provided a lot of detail there but are you seeing any differences in that forward booking trend by customer base, whether it's luxury versus moderate, new to sail versus returning customers? And then I guess given some of the shipping capacity in China are you seeing any change specifically in consumer demand there in the market versus fly to sail (42:21)? Thanks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. I'll try to remember all of your questions. The upscale brands are performing extremely well. The forward booking curve for the upscale brands continue to expand. As I mentioned, Splendor that doesn't start operating until 2020 had a record booking day by over 30% and that should give you a proxy by which you can think about the rest of the fleet at the upscale brands. At Norwegian Cruise Lines, the year-over-year increase in load factor is truly impressive. And it's across the new ships, across the legacy fleet, across all destinations. And to have that combination with higher pricing, I can't say it enough, I see absolutely no effect of all the things, the big boogeyman that some investors are worried about, I just don't see it coming. In terms of China as I've said in my most recent commentary I continue to be encouraged about China. I feel better about China today than I certainly did six months ago. The reduction in capacity in China that's coming up starting in Q3 of this year without any new addition is certainly helping the situation in terms of the supply demand balance. We see pricing up in the last \u2013 in the second half of the year, up solid mid-single digits from our first year introduction. And that's important because typically in the second year of a ship being introduced you have a dip in the yield growth and what we're seeing the opposite in China. And then we're optimistic about our ability to meaningfully increase onboard spend in China from the introduction of our Joy At Sea promotion which is a \u2013 the same concept of bundling that we've been able to introduce successfully in North America and throughout Europe. We're going to test to see whether the Chinese consumer likes free stuff just like the rest of the world does, and I'm hopeful that they do. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's all super helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infiniti Research. Your line is now open. Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research Ltd.: Good morning, guys. One quick question. Want to switch gears to Europe for the summer season. We go through sort of a few weeks basically now and then towards the end of May and early June the where I think close-in pricing from European source passengers becomes important. Will that possibly be a reason to raise guidance for Q3 further? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Can you articulate your question? I didn't quite understand the question. Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research Ltd.: Frank, basically I think there's some European source passenger bookings that come very close to the start of season. Could that be reason for further enthusiasm for Q2? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Thank you. Our Europe business continues to perform very, very well across all three brands both in Northern Europe and the Mediterranean, all solid year-over-year pricing gains and the load factors are extremely well sold. I think, you've heard me say in previous calls that our go-to-market strategy in Europe, our bundling strategy that we've laid out throughout Europe is causing us to be agnostic as to where the consumer comes from. We're chasing what you would call the best customer and it's proven to be strong and we're going to have a lot of discussion about this on Friday on earnings day. But the North American consumer is returning to Europe in a very, very big way. The trend that we saw last year where the numbers for the North American sourced business was very, very strong. It's continuing and the strength is being seen in the pricing that we're able to command in the marketplace. So, I think that Europe overall is going to be a very, very good news story in 2018. Assia Georgieva - Infiniti Research Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. And I look forward to Friday. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good seeing you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Your line is now open. Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious in China how you feel like you maybe have to stay with the charter business for an extended period of time or maybe are there some lessons that you've gleaned from others that have entered before you, that might help you shift away from selling through charters for faster than others may have? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Hi, Jamie. Look, I think the whole industry wants to shift away from the charter model, because, as you know, one of the most important functions of a cruise line is its ability to yield manage. And in essence, the charter business doesn't allow you to yield manage anywhere near the way that you can in the more traditional model that we have in North America. So we along with the rest of the industry is moving away. Less than 20% of our overall business in 2018 will be full ship charters and we believe that number will below 10% in 2019. So certainly the trend is moving away from full ship charters. But there is still a long ways to go from moving away from full ship charters to being \u2013 to having a travel agent dominant marketplace where hundreds of travel agents fill a particular sailing. Ultimately that's where we need to go. That's the most efficient way of distributing our products across a broad market. And I believe that as the Chinese market matures and people from \u2013 throughout China and not just the greater metropolitan Shanghai area or Tianjin area get exposed to cruising, but that's exactly what will happen. Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Frank, you sound really confident just overall on what you're seeing right now, but your stock just really hasn't been trading well in the midst of really all the strength you've been seeing for many months now. So my question is, why is low 3 the leverage right now so important? And would you consider delaying the target to get more aggressive on the buyback in the near term, especially since you might get an opportunity, especially with the secondary upcoming? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We manage the business for the long term. And while I am disappointed as many other investors are in the share price today, we think it is ridiculously low. It is what it is. And sooner or later it will right itself. We do believe that for the long term to delever from where we are today is important. And we'll talk more about that as well at Investor Day and how we plan on delevering and returning capital to shareholders. I don't think, Jared, that will change that strategy. It's something that the board and I feel strongly about to delever to those levels and to reach our target lever area that again we'll share with you on Friday. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just switching gears here. On the back-half yield guidance raised, would you say that demand in March and April accelerated from what you were initially seeing back in February? Or were you just baking in some conservatism in case there were some unexpected surprises, which there really haven't been in the last couple months? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Business has been pretty steady throughout 2018 so far. As I've said earlier, some of our brands have begun to pivot to booking more 2019 than 2018. So the overall volume has remained pretty much the same throughout the first four months of the year, but some of that volume has diverted to 2019 inventory. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay, Jared. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good morning. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Frank, my first question concerns if you could perhaps help quantify what your booking curve is right now. You certainly listed that as the booking curve is a reason giving you confidence that a recession isn't imminent. And how that length of booking curve has changed since over the past year or even since the February earnings. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. So if you recall that at the end of the year we said that our booking curve has improved some 18% from the prior year at year-end. And today that trend has continued. You never know what the optimal booking curve is. I don't have that answer. What I have said is if you can continue to stretch that booking curve further and further into the future, while at the same time raising prices, then I think you're onto something. And that's what we do and that's what we have been doing. And that's why you see, for example, as a data point, when we introduced Splendor, which doesn't come out until Q1 of 2020, how well booked she is. And that gives you an idea of the overall sense of the marketplace. So the booking curve is at a longer point today than it was a year ago and that's why 2019 is booked as well as it is, not to mention those very early 2020, can't believe we're even talking about 2020. But, yeah, booking curve is at a longer point today than a year ago and that's contributing certainly to our confidence to be able to raise prices along the way. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you for the color on that. Then just a quick \u2013 one more quick question here. I noted last quarter you had said you intended this year to purchase $264 million of shares. Does today's announcement of the $1 billion share repurchase authorization, does that change that target? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, we announced the $1 billion new buyback program a couple weeks ago. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And we're going to remain opportunistic. We'll see how things transcend through the year. We're still very focused on delevering to the low 3s. But we're doing well. We're generating free cash, and we'll use it the best way we can noting that it is our strong intent to begin to meaningfully return capital to shareholders in the coming year. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So would $264 million be sort of the base case and there could possibly be more above and beyond that? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Patrick, the $264 million we already completed in Q1. That was part of our prior share repurchase authorization. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, okay. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: The $1 billion is a completely new program. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Okay. Just wanted to be clear on that. Thank you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Any other questions? Operator : Yes, I am showing we have a question from the line of Vince Ciepiel with CRC. Your line is now open. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question. One of your peers alluded to better recent booking trends for Caribbean sailings in the remainder of this year. Curious if you had seen any change in the last three to four weeks and curious what might be driving that now. Andrew Stuart - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, it's Andy. I'll take that. Caribbean booking trends have continued reasonably strongly. We are seeing strong close-in bookings trends for Q2 and Q3 where we have relatively little capacity comparatively. As we look out the 12 months, as I said to Robin earlier, we're happy with where we are. We're ahead on pricing and load, and we see a pretty positive trend in the Caribbean looking forward. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great, thanks. And then maybe a quick one for Mark. You raised the business on the strength of core yields despite what looked like fuel and FX moving against you. Just curious if you could put a number on what type of headwind you saw from fuel and FX, maybe $0.05 or $0.10 since you last gave guidance? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, I would say it's in the neighborhood of $0.04 to $0.05... Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: ...combined. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you for taking my question here. Just a couple. And again not to beat the Caribbean, but let me ask this a different way maybe. If you had it to do over again, given what you're seeing and granted you basically pulled a lot of capacity out for Q2 and Q3 out of the Eastern Caribbean, would you make that same decision if you had to do it over again? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, okay, okay. And then another thing just wanted to ask Frank and maybe he'll hit it on Friday, so we can wait until then. But let's get to your deleveraging target as you guys have remained very intently focused on thankfully. After that share repurchase and dividends obviously in the mix, what about M&A? What about M&A? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, Tim, you know how M&A works. You can't really count on it. You always keep your options open. You talk to all the investment bankers who have something to offer. But this is a highly consolidated industry already. That's how we got here. Not sure there's much left. And I'll leave it at that. It's not something that we are out there shaking the bushes pursuing because we have to have an acquisition in order to make our numbers and to show a healthy growth rate. We've got a very disciplined newbuild program that takes one vessel per year. We have the youngest fleet in the industry. We generate the highest yields in the industry. We generate the highest EBITDA per bed in the industry. So quite frankly, we don't have to have in any way, shape, or form an M&A transaction to beef up that growth profile. If one comes along that's accretive to earnings, we'll certainly take a look at it, but it's not something that we must have. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Okay. Thank you for the time. (59:17) we'll see you on Friday. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, thank you, everyone, for participating in this morning's call. And I look forward to seeing most of you, if not all of you, on Friday onboard our beautiful new Norwegian Bliss. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Liz and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco Sieger - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Mark Kempa, Senior Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Andy Stuart, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary. After which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide guidance for 2018 before turning the call back to Frank for some closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com and will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2018 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to announce another quarter of record financial performance for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, underscored by a robust macroeconomic environment that shows no signs of weakening and bolstered by marketing initiatives that continue to drive strong consumer demand across our three award winning brands. This robust environment combined with our record first half earnings performance, the stellar introduction of the latest ship in our fleet, Norwegian Bliss, and a solid booked position for the second half of the year have led us to meaningfully increase our earnings expectations for full year 2018. Mark will discuss the details of our record financial results for the quarter a little later on, which included measurable outperformance in both top line revenue and bottom line earnings, while I will discuss some of the strategic initiatives that have resulted in our increased earnings power and heightened expectations for full year 2018 and beyond. A few weeks ago, we announced a strategic shift in our 2019 and 2020 fleet deployment to capitalize on the strong and sustained cruise demand we are witnessing by enhancing our itineraries to include more ships, operating more sailings in better performing un-served and underserved markets. Concurrently, we took the opportunity to preview our earnings expectation for full year 2018. Today, I'm pleased to report that we have not only increased our prior earnings guidance for the year, but that confidence in our performance expectations is now such that we have increased the midpoint of our full year guidance well above the high end of our previous guidance range. Our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share is now in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 with a midpoint that puts our expected year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth at approximately 20%. This improved outlook is even more impressive given that it is inclusive of expected headwinds from higher fuel pricing, fluctuating foreign exchange rates and an impact of approximately $0.10 per share related to certain short-term market disruptions on Norwegian Joy China sailings and the incremental sales and marketing expense associated with the new itineraries. One reason for our more bullish outlook has been the stellar performance of Norwegian Bliss. I want to take a moment to congratulate Andy Stuart and the team in Norwegian Cruise Line for a textbook introduction of a new ship to the marketplace. The team executed the launch plan flawlessly and in every aspect from sticking zealously to the booking curve, to consistently stimulating quality demand and the lead-up to launch to delivering a record setting inaugural program that introduced Bliss to thousands of travel partners in several of the world's leading cruise ports, while garnering over 2.4 billion media impressions in the process. Her performance to-date has been nothing short of extraordinary, particularly in terms of onboard revenue, where her yields are surpassing our highest expectations and breaking record sailing after sailing. Bliss's incredible reception from the cruising public is just the latest evidence of the extraordinary demand for cruise vacations that we have been experiencing since late 2016. During that span, we have seen quarterly occupancies and pricing consistently exceed prior year levels with the booking window continuing to be at or near optimal levels. The continued strength in worldwide cruise demand and the broad acceptance of our product offerings across all three brands is the main driver of our more bullish outlook. This robust demand is being promoted by consumers, particularly from the United States that are enjoying positive economic environment that lead to a healthy wealth effect, resulting from unemployment near record lows, strong GDP growth, federal income tax relief, relatively low interest rate and stock market at near record highs. All of these factors converged to cause consumer confidence indices to also be at or near all-time highs which in turn speeds and promotes increased discretionary consumer spending on items such as cruise vacations. And as an industry, cruising has a unique advantage in that it can measure consumer confidence first hand in both the short and long-term. We measure short-term confidence literally every day through trends in onboard spend, while long-term confidence is validated by growth in the number of bookings, ticket pricing and the length of the booking curve. At Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, all of these short and longer term indicators have been at historic highs for some time, given the impressive macro trends bolstering the economy at large, we see no reason why these rising trends won't continue supply growth notwithstanding. And as you all well know, there has been much, perhaps too much, consternation over near-term supply growth, which at six or so percent, is only one or two points higher than the previous 10-year CAGR. Since 2016, the first full year after the Acquisition of Prestige to the current expectations for full year 2018, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has demonstrated its ability to profitably absorb outsized supply growth. On a CAGR basis, the company has absorbed supply growth of 9%, while growing adjusted net yield over 3% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 18% during the same three-year period. In fact, with less than 4% supply growth, 2019 represents one of the lowest years of supply growth for the company in quite some time. Our disciplined supply growth of roughly 4% in 2019, followed by 8% in 2020 and zero growth in 2021, is extremely modest when measured against both our demonstrated ability to take on new capacity and the abundance of unserved and underserved markets that are available for us to deploy additional capacity. Given our consistently high load factors coupled with our reliable year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansion as evidenced by our 40 quarters of consecutive trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA growth, we are very confident in our ability to drive demand and continue delivering by a wide margin, I should say, best industry ticket yield, onboard yield and EBITDA for capacity day. This stronger for longer cycle also manifests itself in our high yielding third quarter sailings in Alaska, the Mediterranean and the Baltic, which are performing extremely well and garnering record yields. This greatly benefits the Oceania and Regent brands, which have approximately two-thirds of their deployment in the Mediterranean and Baltic region, with Alaska comprising the vast majority of remaining itineraries. At the same time, the Norwegian brand is also benefiting with half of its capacity in these high priced regions during the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the previously announced fleet redeployment plan capitalizes not only in the strength of our core and strong performing markets, but also enables us to make inroads into some of the underserved and unserved markets that will further enhance the Norwegian brand presence around the globe. A key component of this shift is the redeployment of Norwegian Joy to Alaska in the summer of 2019 to capitalize in the strong demand of cruises in the region. She joins a record breaking sister ship Norwegian Bliss along with Norwegian Jewel to deliver an unparalleled offering of sailings to the last frontier that will include the two largest and newest ships deployed to Alaska. The prospects of adding significant capacity to a mature market may cause some to pause, but as I mentioned earlier in my commentary, the company has time and time again proven that we are able to profitably add new capacity in mature regions. And you don't have to look very far back for the latest example of our ability to create quality demand that outstrips supply growth. Capacity in Alaska for the Norwegian brand grew 15% in 2018 as a result of the addition of Norwegian Bliss, while ticket pricing improved a whopping 25% in the same period. In winter 2019, Joy redeploys from Alaska to a market that has been historically underserved. Beginning in October, Joy will sail a series of Mexican Riviera and Panama Canal cruises from Los Angeles. We are very excited to bring a new and premier cruise ship to this historically underserved West Coast market by providing winter sailings in the second largest metropolitan area in the country, which is a market ripe with opportunity. Joy's redeployment frees up capacity that allows for deployments in 2019 to shift into other promising underserved and unserved markets for the Norwegian brand, including Australia, where Norwegian Jewel will return for a third season, adding a slate of new sailings from New Zealand, the company's sixth largest source market. The greater Asia Pacific region, where in addition to Norwegian Jewel, we will deploy Norwegian Jade to sail seasonally from Singapore and Hong Kong. And lastly Europe, by deploying Norwegian Pearl in summer of 2019 to debut a series of sailings from Amsterdam, a new homeport for the Norwegian brand, increasing the total number of the brands shipped in Europe from five to six during the peak summer season. And rounding out this redeployment initiative is the seasonal deployment of Norwegian Spirit to Shanghai beginning in summer of 2020. While these redeployments begin in 2019, due to the timing of certain costs and other factors, including a one-time non-cash write-off of approximately $25 million tied to the enhancements planned for Norwegian Joy, we expect these deployment initiatives to be only slightly accretive for earnings in the year. As a result, 2019's expected full year performance will still behave more like an organic year in terms of earnings per share and yield growth, as the introduction of the year's only newbuild, Norwegian Encore, occurs at the tail end of the year and we will be rolling over tougher comps from Norwegian Bliss's highly successful inaugural debut. Conversely, 2020 which was already expected to be a breakout year with the benefit from close to a full year of sailings from two of our newest vessels, Norwegian Encore and Seven Seas Splendor, will further benefit from our itinerary optimization initiatives, especially Norwegian Joy's move to Alaska. Now, focusing on 2019 and since our last call, booking volumes have accelerated at higher prices and the year is shaping up extremely well, better than 2018 at this time, with all of our major destinations \u2013 Europe, Alaska and Caribbean \u2013 seeing year-over-year growth in both load and pricing. Oceania and Regent for example, whose itineraries tend to book further out, are already 50% booked for the year, the earliest that either brand has reached this booking milestone in their respective histories with pricing substantially higher versus this year's record levels. The Norwegian brand which will benefit from both Bliss's menu introduction and Joy's new deployment is also performing at record level with load and pricing well ahead versus the same time last year. And to perhaps best demonstrate the health of our future booked position, at June 30, 2018, our advance ticket sales which reflects deposit and final payments received for all future sailings, is up 26% over prior year on capacity growth of just 9%. In the quarter just ended, it was the stellar performance of all three of our brands led by strong yield growth and tight cost controls that drove our record results. These are also the same drivers that extend to our expected full year performance and the setting up of 2019 to be another record year. And now to go over our results in more detail, I'll turn the call over to Mark Kempa, after which I will return with some closing comments. Mark? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2018 and 2017 net yield and adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our second quarter results followed by color on booking trends then walk through the puts and takes of the itinerary optimization initiatives and will close with our outlook and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2018. I'm pleased to report yet another record quarter with both second quarter revenue and earnings the highest in our company's history. Earnings for the quarter exceeded expectations by $0.19 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, surpassing guidance of approximately $1.02. The beat was driven by $0.09 of revenue outperformance from strong well priced close-in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue; a $0.07 benefit from fuel and FX of which $0.06 came in below the line from the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on our advance ticket sales liability, please note that approximately $0.03 of this benefit is expected to reverse in the back half of this year impacting revenue yield metrics on an as reported basis; a $0.02 benefit resulting from the timing of certain ship operating costs, which have shifted into the third quarter; and the remainder coming from other below the line items. It is worth noting that this record revenue and earnings performance comes despite headwinds from lost revenue and higher operating expense as a result of close to 50 incremental dry-dock days scheduled in the quarter, which were primarily related to investments as part of our Norwegian Edge refurbishment program and had an approximately $0.20 per share drag to earnings in the quarter. Net yield increased 4% or 4.7% on an as reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations by 200 basis points driven by strong well-priced close-in bookings and higher than expected onboard revenue and builds on last year's exceptional growth of 8.1%. Excluding the impact from our new Norwegian brand capacity, which is dilutive to the NCLH corporate average in the quarter, our second quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 5.25%. Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel increased 7.4% versus prior year, and 8.4% on an as reported basis as a result of the aforementioned incremental dry-dock days. Turning to fuel, our fuel expense per metric ton, net of hedges, increased to $481 from $469 in the prior year and was unfavorable to guidance as a result of higher than anticipated pricing. Better than expected fuel efficiency from our newbuilds along with consumption savings from continued energy conservation efforts led to a reduction in fuel consumption, offsetting the rising fuel prices and resulting in favorable overall fuel expense versus guidance. Taking a look below the line, interest expense net was $73 million compared to $64.2 million in 2017. The increase was primarily related to additional debt in connection with the newbuilds including Project Leonardo financing as well as higher interest rates due to an increase in LIBOR. These increases were partially offset by the benefit from the full redemption of our 4.625% senior notes in 2017 and the $135 million partial redemption of our 4.75% senior notes in April 2018, which included a $6.3 million redemption premiums and financing fee write-offs. Now, let's shift to third quarter capacity and deployment. Capacity is expected to increase approximately 8%, primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Bliss to the fleet late in the second quarter. As for deployment, approximately 18% of our capacity is deployed in the Caribbean, during the summer shoulder season, up from prior year's 16% as Norwegian Sun joins Norwegian Sky, to operate mainly three and four-night itineraries to Havana and the Bahamas. The deployment is rounded out by the Norwegian Getaway sailing Western Caribbean itineraries and Norwegian Gem sailing to the Bahamas and Florida from New York. Our peak season sailings in Europe represent approximately 37% of our deployment in line with prior year. While Alaska accounts for approximately 18%, up 200 basis points from the prior year as a result of the addition of Norwegian Bliss. As for other key markets, Bermuda accounts for approximately 11%, Asia, Africa, Pacific approximately 7%, and Hawaii approximately 4% of our total deployment. As Frank mentioned earlier, in July, we announced a strategic shift in the 2019 and 2020 deployments for the Norwegian brand. I would like to walk you through the financial puts and takes of this initiative for the next three years. First, in the back half of 2018, we expect an impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.10, half of which is revenue related from Joy's announced redeployment from the Chinese market and the other half related to incremental sales and marketing expense for the new itineraries. These headwinds are expected to be more than offset by stronger yields from our core fleet bolstered by continued strength in global demand. Both the impacts from the strategic redeployments along with the benefits from stronger fleet wide demand in our core markets are reflected in our updated guidance. In 2019, the itinerary optimization changes are expected to be slightly accretive to adjusted EPS such that incremental earnings driven by the higher yields commanded from a partial year of the new itinerary deployments will be substantially offset by the following items : dry-dock expenses for the upgrades and enhancements to Norwegian Joy; a one-time non-cash write-off of approximately $25 million stemming from the enhancements; lost revenue from the five weeks Joy will be out of service to complete her dry-dock and reposition to Seattle; and additional sales and marketing expense for the new itineraries. In 2020, adjusted EPS accretion is expected to be approximately $0.30 as we realize the full earnings power of these itinerary optimization initiatives. Turning to expectations for the third quarter, net yield is expected to increase approximately 3.5% on both a constant currency and as reported basis. This growth comes despite headwinds in foreign exchange and the revenue impact from China sailings related to the itinerary optimization. Excluding this revenue impact, net yield growth is expected to be approximately 4%, half of which is being driven by Norwegian Bliss, which is exceeding our high expectations and garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 2.5% or 2.75% on an as reported basis, primarily due to incremental sales and marketing expenses for the new itineraries and increase in management incentive compensation due to expected over performance on our financial results for the year and the timing of certain expenses between the second and third quarters. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $505 with expected consumption of approximately 205,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the third quarter is expected to be $2.20. As for the full year, continued strong booking trends across all core markets, for all three brands have resulted in the raising of our outlook for net yield growth by 75 basis points and is now expected to be up approximately 3.25% or 3.5% on an as reported basis. This growth is inclusive of an approximate 25-basis-point impact from Norwegian Joy's in year China sailings stemming from the redeployment changes and comes on top of solid prior year growth of 5%. Excluding new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand, net yield is expected to be up 3.5% inclusive of the 25-basis-point impact from Joy, further illustrating the pricing strength of our core fleet. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up 1.5% or 2% on an as reported basis. The increase versus previous guidance is attributed to the aforementioned incremental expenses to market the new itineraries and the increase in management incentive compensation. Looking at fuel expense, our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, is now expected to be $475 with expected consumption of approximately 825,000 metric tons. Fuel consumption is favorable versus prior guidance as a result of newbuild fuel efficiency and greater benefits than anticipated from fleet wide fuel savings initiatives, which are expected to more than offset higher fuel prices for the remainder of the year. To summarize, strong and well priced close-in bookings along with strong onboard revenue in the second quarter coupled with higher expectations for the remainder of the year have resulted in an increase to topline expectations. This is partially offset by headwinds from rising fuel prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the impacts from the itinerary optimization initiatives. The net result is an improvement in our outlook for adjusted EPS to now be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 which surpasses the high end of our previous guidance range. Excluding the impacts related to the itinerary optimization initiatives, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance would have increased to approximately $4.85. At the midpoint of our new guidance, the $0.12 increase in full year adjusted EPS is driven by the following expectations : outperformance in the topline of $0.19 of which $0.09 was passed through from the Q2 beat and $0.10 is due to the stronger revenue outlook for the back half of the year; a $0.03 net benefit from FX; and approximately $0.02 of accretion from share repurchases during the quarter. These benefits are expected to be partially offset by a $0.10 impact from the itinerary optimization of which half is revenue and half is cost related and $0.05 due to the increased management incentive compensation. The balance is due to a slight improvement to our outlook for fuel, interest and depreciation expense. Our updated guidance now increases our expected growth in adjusted EPS to approximately 20% at the midpoint which comes on top of prior year's strong growth of 16%. Turning to capital allocation, we remain focused on returning significant capital to our shareholders. And as our balance sheet continues to strengthen in combination with strong financial performance, we will continue to pivot towards delivering meaningful capital returns. We opportunistically repurchased $200 million of our shares during the quarter bringing the year-to-date total for share repurchases to $464 million. These capital return initiatives resulted from our increasing confidence and conviction in the company's business outlook as well as the opportunity for us to repurchase shares at a discounted valuation. As for leverage, we remain on track to delever to the low three times by year end. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing remarks. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Mark. As I stated earlier, 2020 will mark a breakout year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The two newest vessels to the Norwegian and Regent brands will be sailing for essentially a full year and by the end of 2020, we expect to have achieved the targets we laid out in our recent Investor Day. These targets are focused on enhancing returns to shareholders by delivering a double-digit three-year CAGR for adjusted earnings per share, adjusted return on invested capital of 12%, up from 10% in 2017 and expected returns to shareholders of $1 billion to $1.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends from 2018 through 2020 of which $464 million has already been returned to shareholders through share repurchases this year. Looking beyond 2020, in July, we confirmed our order with Fincantieri for ships five and six in the Norwegian brand's new Leonardo Class, extending our newbuild portfolio and securing our company's growth prospects through 2027. We are extremely excited about this new class of vessel. The size of the Leonardo Class allows for tremendous flexibility and deployment with a footprint large enough to include all of the hugely popular features on board Norwegian Bliss with new and exciting innovation that we will announce at a later date. I am very excited for the future of our company as we continue to execute on strategies to drive top line growth, control costs and increase efficiencies, enhancing returns to our shareholders and most importantly, delivering exceptional cruise experiences to our guests whenever and wherever they want to travel across an unparalleled portfolio of brands. And with that, I'll turn the call over to questions. Liz? Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Your line is now open. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Very good results. I had kind of a larger question relating to next year's supply growth and forward bookings. What's your view of where in the globe the supply growth is going to be the highest next year and can you give us some more color on demand and pricing? And then kind of the second part of that is, as we get deeper into the booking cycle, shouldn't you expect that booking gap to eventually close as you yield manage for higher prices next year? And isn't that a positive? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good morning, Harry. Thank you. The capacity growth next year for the industry at large is in the neighborhood of 6.5%. As I mentioned earlier, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings increase of supply is a little less than 4%, as we lap about five months of Bliss and only have about a month of the Norwegian Encore. So it's relatively subdued by our history and several points below the industry. Where we're seeing \u2013 where we're going to be deploying our additional capacity is thankfully where we're seeing the most strength \u2013 and that is in Europe and in Alaska with the Joy being repositioned there starting in late April. So we think we're putting our best hardware where it's generating the highest yield. For the industry, I believe Alaska is the region of the world that will see the highest capacity growth year-over-year. So we don't \u2013 again, as you've heard me say before, this is a long-term business. You order ships way ahead in advance. We're very, very happy with the tenor of our supply growth. I, quite frankly, wish I had more ships coming sooner. Our load factors are at an all-time high. Our pricing is at an all-time high. I can make the argument that I'm capacity constrained. So I'm glad to see Bliss performing as well as she's performing. I'm anxious to get our hands on Encore. So that's all very positive. And in terms of your other question, in terms of how far out do you get in terms of bookings and pricing, you never really know what the optimal yield curve is. There's \u2013 what I always say is \u2013 if I can continue to extend the curve or maintain the curve at higher prices, I think it's pushing in the right direction and that's exactly what we're seeing. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is now open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Andrea DeMarco Sieger - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good morning. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you hear me? Andrea DeMarco Sieger - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. We can hear you. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. Hi, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. So I have \u2013 so Frank \u2013 you gave a statistic that I wanted to make sure I heard right. You said that advance ticket sales were up 26%. I think I heard that was for all future bookings, but I just wanted to make sure that was correct and not just 2019? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No. If you go to our balance sheet and you'll see that year-over-year our advance ticket sales liability on the balance sheet is up 26% on a 9% increase in capacity. So we can talk all we want of how good things are, but that is a black and white auditable number, that has to pass those scrutiny of the auditors if you will, that sits in the balance sheet, which I think is proof positive that the future of business is very strong, stronger than ever \u2013 hard to grow that advance ticket sales up 26% if it wasn't. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So just as a follow on to that if we look at 2019, which is certainly a function of what you're talking about. And obviously that's strong, you've laid that out in the press release and in your comments, just wondering since your last call, what's changed? How much more booked are you than you were last quarter for 2019? How much more visibility were you able to gain in the quarter? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Well, I'm not going to give you the delta between where we were three months ago, where we are today. I will tell you that compared on a year-over-year basis, we are better booked today at higher prices than we were 90 days ago. So that positive trend that I mentioned in my opening comments is manifesting itself in the number of bookings we're taking and at higher prices. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And I do have a technical question for Mark. The $0.10 impact from itinerary optimization that you're going to see in the second half, is that fair to split it 50-50 between the third quarter and the fourth quarter? And is it fair to assume that if you adjust for the $0.10, one half of that being affecting revenue yield or revenues, would it be fair to say that the 50 basis point increase that you reported in the second half would have really been 100 basis points? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, great question. So, yes, the $0.10, it is split evenly between revenue and cost both in the third and fourth quarter. In the third quarter though, you do have a bit more revenue impact and conversely in the fourth quarter there's a little less and the impact is more expenses around the marketing initiatives. So then going back to our full year guidance what we've said is if we raised our full year guidance 75 basis points or if we excluded the impact of that, we would have raised our yields 100 basis points. So we're seeing significant strength. We saw it in Q2 back half is building well and we have great expectations for it. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is now open. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on the strong second quarter. So I guess the question is around the Norwegian fleet enhancements and the itinerary changes, Frank you talked about this morning and brought up a couple of weeks ago. You mentioned these are going to change \u2013 or these changes will drive about $0.30 in additional earnings in 2020. I was wondering if you can help us think about maybe how you came up with that estimate or maybe what are some of the drivers going into that $0.30 number? Thanks. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Hi Steve, it's Mark. Yeah, so, on a net basis it's roughly $0.30. If we looked at it as just moving the Norwegian Joy into the North American market, that's obviously a higher number than $0.30. But then you do have a domino effect of taking out certain ships and redeploying them into other markets. So you do have some puts and takes. There is a bit more marketing expense that we have to incur. And then there's a little bit of incremental depreciation. So all in all, we think the $0.30 is a good number, but you have to keep in mind that there is some domino effect as you redeploy the other ships in the optimization. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But your assumptions behind whether it's yield increases or onboard spend are fairly essentially in line with what you're seeing today, is that kind of fair? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, I mean we're putting Joy in Alaska because Alaska on the heels of Bliss's extraordinary introduction is the place you want to put more capacity and Bliss and Joy are near identical vessels. So we think the market will really enjoy seeing additional capacity there. And the fundamental driver of that $0.30 is higher yields; primarily higher onboard yields compared to where that vessel is operating today. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then Frank, second question, as you decide to pull Joy out of the Chinese cruise market, clearly, you guys do remain committed to that market by putting Spirit in on a seasonal basis. But, I guess, as you look back what are some of the biggest things you have learned from being in that market with Joy. And I guess at the end of the day, is this move just the fact that given your smaller fleet size putting Joy in there wasn't the right ship, as you are leaving money on the table or are there other things like the Korea issue or other things like that that weighed more on this ultimate decision? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We are a for-profit organization. So at the end of the day it has to do with the profit contributions of that vessel. And you hit the nail on the head, Steve. With only 26 vessels, we aim for quality, if you will, versus quantity. We don't need unit growth. We're always looking for higher and higher profitability. And the delta between the performance of what that vessel was generating in China and what we expected to generate in Alaska and in Mexico, Panama Canal cruises in the wintertime, was significant. And so, we do believe that China still holds significant potential and we will participate in that potential with a vessel that doesn't have the same opportunity cost gap that Joy has. Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, I want to go back to your targets that you laid out at the Analyst Day. And specifically, if I look at your long term EPS target of double-digit CAGR, is your expectation that each year should be double digits? And specifically, as I look at next year, you're starting at the year at a pretty great position, just based on the booking commentary you've given, but it's also a lower capacity growth here. So, I guess, specifically, is your expectation that you could be at double-digit growth next year? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Good morning, Jared. 2019 is going to be a challenging year to achieve that double-digit. We firmly believe that over the three-year period the CAGR will exceed the double-digits but whether we will be able to generate double-digit in year 2019, that's going to be a yeoman's effort. We're going to do everything we can to do that. We certainly acknowledge the optics behind that. But, you know that, it's challenging to do so purely organically, especially, given the fantastic year that we're going to be printing in 2018. So we're going to give it everything we've got. 2019 is starting out very strong. It gives us encouragement that we have a shot at it, but it's going to be more difficult than in any other year that certainly I've been here. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow up for me. Now that you've done the $200 million on the buyback, does that change your appetite for participating on a possible secondary? And seemed like some of the language was more favorable towards capital returns. Have you changed your thinking in terms of your long term 2.5% to 2.75% leverage targets? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: No. No, we haven't. No, we haven't. The only thing that we will have to see how things turn out is whether we decide to return capital via continued share buyback or dividends and a lot of that will have to depend on the prices of stock, which, certainly, by the time we get to the point of deciding that, the stock should be back to more rational levels than it is today. It's ridiculous that a company with our growth history of circa 20% year after year after year, with the visibility that we have in this business, that our stock trades sub-10 times next year's estimate. So we certainly hope that the rationalization comes back into the market and that the stock price will reflect our performance because today there's a grotesque disconnect. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. David James Beckel - Bernstein Research : Hey. Thanks for the question. So I just wanted to touch a little bit on IMO 2020 and the effects you guys will feel from that. At your Investor Day, you were giving guidance that about 60% of your fleet would be exposed to lower sulfur fuel. Could you I guess start by explaining the extent to which you didn't install scrubbers on some ships and why? And then also as a quick follow-up to that, has your 2020 guidance, does that account for what some forward curves expect is a pretty dramatic increase in low sulfur fuel and a decline in bunker? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. So I'll take the 2020 curve question first. Yeah, our estimates do look at the curves and we do take into account the potential drop in HFO pricing. On the flip side, we are also accounting for what we expect is going to be an increased pricing on MGO. So that is all taken into account in our estimates and we watch that carefully every quarter. In terms of installing scrubbers on our fleet, it really comes down to \u2013 it's a couple of issues. So some of the ships, if we take our smaller fleet in the Oceania and Regent vessels, it becomes a question of real estate versus the cost to burn the cleaner fuel. And with the size of those ships, we just didn't feel like it was a wise investment to take away from the public space areas and potentially cabin revenue generating areas. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. And in some cases, they simply don't fit. These are smaller vessels, the stack on the vessels is just too small given today's technology and the way scrubbers are built and installed, they simply don't fit. And in some cases, the ROIs don't make sense either because of deployment or because of the size or the age of the vessel. So we look at this very, very closely and we still believe that there are other options. We've heard analyses that there may be blends of certain fuels that will be available, that will reduce the cost of the less sulfur fuel. So it's still early, but I assure you that we've done everything we can to minimize the impact of the new IMO regulation and that that impact is fully reflected in our forward guidance. David James Beckel - Bernstein Research : That's helpful. Thanks and a quick follow-up. Can we assume that your NCL ships all have scrubbers or will by 2020? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: The vast majority will have them. There are a couple of ships, the older vessels, the Sky and the Spirit most likely will not. And that was accounted for in our estimates when we gave the 60 :40 percentage split on Investor Day. David James Beckel - Bernstein Research : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is now open. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Robin, are you there? Operator, perhaps we can move to someone else. Operator : Robin, your line is now open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. hopefully, you can hear me now? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yes. Hi, Robin. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. Two topics. One is with the firm order of the Leonardo, I guess, I think that may be a record ordering a ship nine years in advance making it a firm order. I'm just wondering what was the reason for committing so far in advance. Was there something much more attractive in the order price for that? And then just the second topic I wanted to ask about was with the change in China of the Joy, I'm just trying to understand, what is the lost revenue this year since that deployment change is for starting in April of next year? And then also expenses, it looks like outside of the Joy, that $0.05 you called out, are also going up and just looking for some color there? Thanks. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. So on the \u2013 I'll start with it Joy. So it's a $0.10 impact this year, which is evenly split between revenue and costs. The costs are really just related to incremental marketing expenses as we have to market the new itineraries. And there is a bit of revenue dilution as we \u2013 when we made the announcement we did have a bit of market disruption from some of our operators \u2013 so we thought it prudent to lower our estimates, but we believe that's a short term blip in the radar. And then in terms of our remaining cost increase, we did increase our costs by about 50 basis points. And that's primarily due to overperformance on our financial results, so we've increased our accruals for management incentive compensation. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: And in terms of the Leonardo order, there's a couple of factors at work. Number one that there is strong competition between the cruise companies or the very limited construction slots at the shipyards. That's why the order book is as long as it is. And second, we were able to lock in, as you suggested, favorable pricing. As you know in this business, you typically order a series of vessels and that averages out the high cost of the engineering. We're very excited about the Leonardo Class. We think that it's just perfect for what we're trying to accomplish at the Norwegian brand : a product, a brand that is priced on the very high end of the contemporary space. And this vessel, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is going to have all the bells and whistles that customers are just in love with on Bliss and a few others that we will announce at the right time. So being able to secure the actual slot and being able to have a known quantity of supply growth coming at secured known prices was the primary motivator. I think we might have lost Robin again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey everyone. Can you hear me? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. We can hear you Joe. Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. This is actually Brandt Montour on for Joe. So I was hoping you could give us some incremental color on the Caribbean in the first half next year. What kind of pricing dynamics you're seeing maybe from your competitors? Specifically with older tonnage given the capacity growth, any excessive promotional type activity or any other kind of reactions from them? Andrew Stuart - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, (sic) Brandt, it's Andy. I'll take that, as Norwegian has the lion's share of the Caribbean products. I'll touch on where we are first just to give you a sense for how we're doing. And bear in mind, everything I'm going to give you is pre- the pretty active storm season we had last year. So for 2019, we're up on both load and pricing in the Caribbean. We're seeing positive trends. We're really happy with the momentum that we're seeing. And the other thing you should think about on Caribbean is that we're coming up to what was last year's active storm season and a period of time where bookings were somewhat depressed. So, given the strong position we had this time last year, to be ahead of that on load and pricing, and assuming we don't have a similar storm season, the likelihood that we \u2013 with the momentum we've got \u2013 continue to accelerate past that, we're feeling pretty good about Caribbean for next year. As far as the competitive activity, we really don't see anything unusual out there. We feel very much that we're past the concerns that were driven by last year's storm season and are pretty happy with the momentum that we're seeing and I would say nothing unusual. Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's great color. And then as a follow-up, the Freedom program starts getting implemented later this year, I was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on kind of details on what that's going to look like? And is it more of a testing type rollout or what kind of financial benefits, if any, do you think you expect early on? Andrew Stuart - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, Cruise Freedom is very much in process. As we've talked about we've partnered with a company who we view as the leader in proximity and location technology. And we're very much on track with that program. Our intent is every new ship that we roll out from now will have components of this technology on board. We will be testing elements of it on Norwegian Bliss starting with her Alaska season and through to delivery of Norwegian Encore. And Norwegian Encore will come out with elements of it. We're really not ready to talk about any detail yet. There's no doubt in my mind it's going to drive improvement to the guest experience; we think that's a great opportunity. And we also believe it's going to drive opportunity in onboard revenue but we're really not ready to talk about any details of that yet. Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Great, quarter. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Just to clarify, your organic net yields this year, any way if you strip out Joy and Bliss in the second half here, what those would be? And then it seems like on the fuel side with the increased concerns with your fuel mix in 2020, on the IMO 2020, that you've largely negated that here now with the itinerary changes based on current prices. Just any comments there and then how that would seem to position you better just then go along with what's continued yield moves in 2020? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, we don't really look at the Joy changes or the other itinerary changes as a way to negate fuel prices. We look at ways to maximize our profitability, maximize revenue. Fuel is a necessary evil and we do everything we can to minimize it, both in our very aggressive hedging program and all the investments we've made over the years to install technologies. They are really paying off. And so, I guess, you can look at it that way that one negates the other, but quite frankly when we are looking at how to manage our business, that's not the motivation for doing what we did. And I'll let Mark discuss your question regarding organic net yield. Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, on the organic net yield, so as I said in my prepared remarks, we are estimating roughly 3.5% for the year which includes the 25 basis points for Joy. So excluding that, we're in the 3.75%, and that's both excluding Joy and Bliss just for clarification. So we're very happy with that. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And gentlemen, if I may, one last clarification here, seeing you guys had great on-board performance and seeing a little bit of deceleration there, is that largely Joy related? And maybe we'll see that until we get it repositioned into the North American market and then \u2013 or maybe another way to ask it is, if you pull out Joy, what would those on-boards be? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, so number one as we've been saying, now that we've been selling our product on a bundled basis, GAAP requires us to allocate the revenue in ways that don't necessarily reflect the true performance when you look at the numbers on the financial statement. So I think our on-board revenue is showing us up 0.5% for the quarter, but if you stripped out the GAAP allocation and you stripped out the Joy that number would be closer to the 3% zone. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then, you expect some reacceleration once Joy is changed over Mark? Mark A. Kempa - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Certainly because I think that's where \u2013 that's part of the big opportunity. That's where we see the gap today with the Joy versus being in the North American market. So we definitely expect improvement on that front. Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thanks for confirming it. Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: We've got time for one more question operator. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian. Your line is now open. Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you. So second quarter net yield came in well ahead of guidance 4% versus 2% guidance, so just maybe qualitatively in terms of what drove the improved close-in bookings, whether it's destinations that did particularly well or sourced passenger business that outperformed relative to your expectations? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah, second quarter was great, much better than we anticipated. It's really a number of things. So the Bliss really outperformed our high expectations which we're very pleased of. But we also saw very strong onboard revenue in the rest of our fleet, which is a great indicator for the health of the business. And then with our remaining inventory that we had, we had very strong pricing on our close-in demand, so it was really coming from all fronts, not one particular area. Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then you also mentioned the easy compares that we're going to see when we lapped the hurricanes from last year. So what are you assuming at least for 2018? Are you assuming an acceleration in your guidance in terms of bookings so there's easier compares or are you just assuming kind of a continuation of trend even though the compares get really easier? Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Yeah. I think, again, what we're seeing today versus our booked position where we were last year as Andy had mentioned, we are still comparing pre-hurricane last year. So as we cross over into that in the next few weeks, we should definitely see a further spread in our booked position this year versus same time last year, so we're definitely expecting to see that improvement. Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.: Thank you, Greg. And thank you everyone for your time this morning and your continued support. As always we will be available this afternoon to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions with the session will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer; and Andy Stuart, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide guidance for 2018 before handing the call back to Frank for some closing words. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make references to a slide presentation during this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2018 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2018 picked up with a second quarter left off. As a robust demand environment coupled with precision execution by our three brands lead to record revenue and earnings, and perhaps more importantly contributed to an acceleration of our 2019 record book position. It was a quarter where continued strong demand stimulated by cost effective marketing initiatives and another demand creation strategies, and led by a competent U.S. consumer combined with a multiple benefits of a mostly refurbished fleet and the introduction of Norwegian Bliss, the most successful newbuild in the Company's history, all confluence to generate the highest revenue and earnings of any quarter in our history. To put this milestone into proper perspective, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter just ended equal adjusted earnings per share for all of 2014, the year of the transaction have brought Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises into the Norwegian Cruise Line Holding family. I'm sure everyone will agree that the revenue and earnings growth of our Company of the last several years has been truly outstanding. Our third quarter results were buoyed by three main drivers. First, the blockbuster inaugural season of Norwegian Bliss; second, strong demand across our three brands, primarily from North Americans for voyages and premium destinations, particularly Europe; and third outstanding performance from our two upscale brands. Regarding Norwegian Bliss and to put it bluntly, the vessel is a gift that keeps on giving. The images of guests feeding on her double-decker go-karts racetrack with the Seattle skyline or Alaska\u2019s majestic glazers in the background have become calling card to the brand, appearing in countless instagram fees worldwide and generating consumer interest in the Norwegian brand that no amount of money can buy. Bliss is outstanding financial performance, especially in onboard revenue, has exceeded even our highest expectations. Well on the ticket front, she has spearheaded the effort that drove a 25% plus pricing increase on the Norwegian brands, three ship Alaska deployment, despite a 15% capacity increase. As for the strong demand environment, it was led by a banner year for travel from the new to the old world. We were pleasantly surprised by the further acceleration of demand from North Americans wanting to cruise on Europe itineraries across our three brands. At the same time, the Norwegian brands innovative, premium, all inclusive products allowed us to attract a higher caliber European consumer at higher prices. That result is a second consecutive year of double-digit pricing growth for the all important Europe season. The performance of our two upscale brands, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises is equally impressive. On our last call, you'll recall we've mentioned that the two brands that already broached the 50% load factor mark for 2019. And while that strong booking trend continues to fill next year\u2019s sailings at an unprecedented pace, it also led to record revenue and yield for the two brands in the third quarter, along with a record number of past guests traveling onboard through 10-ship fleet. The best and most accurate barometer of the strong brand affinity and high customer satisfaction levels that Oceania and Regent enjoy. Our confidence in our full-year outlook is such that we have again raised our earnings guidance above the top end of our previous guidance range with adjusted earnings per share now expected to be approximately $4.85 reflecting a 22.5% growth over the prior year. We also see this for both robust demand environments continuing into 2019 with booking windows continues to hold right the historic elongated levels we have seen during the past two years. So strong as this environment that we have once again expect to enter the New Year in a record book position with approximately 65% occupancy on the books as we turn the calendar to 2019 and at higher prices. As I mentioned on our last call, Oceania and Regent were better booked at that point in time for the coming year that in any other time in their history and we are pleased to report the booking volumes and pricing levels have accelerated over the past 13 weeks leading their book position to improve even further to new higher highs. The Norwegian brand two has seen booking volumes accelerate over the past 13 weeks and it's year-over-year leading occupancy has also been extended. Overall, our 2019 books position remains well ahead of this year's record levels in occupancy and pricing across all three brands with advanced ticket sales up 24% year-over-year on an 8% increase in capacity. 2019 we will also see the introduction of Norwegian Encore, the final ship in the Breakaway Plus Class. She has all of the innovative features of her widely successful sister ship Norwegian Bliss with a few new features yet to be announced. Our Hull Art was created by award-winning Catalina artist Eduardo Arranz-Bravo and as a kaleidoscope of color that will make her instantly recognizable as she sails her inaugural season to the Caribbean from Miami in the winter season and to Bermuda from New York City in the summer. Norwegian Encore will begin her inaugural season sailing Caribbean itineraries from Miami towards the end of 2019 or she joins a Caribbean deployment which continues to strengthen and it's up on both occupancy and pricing for the year. Encore, it should be noted at this juncture is the best booked ships both in load and price introduced in the Caribbean since we launched our first Breakaway Class ship in the Regent back in 2013. Also in 2019, we are excited to build upon the success and positive reaction from travel agents and guests like regarding the Norwegian Edge and Regent Seven Seas refurbishment program by launching a reinspiration program for Oceania Cruises Dubbed OceaniaNEXT. These fleet revitalization programs are central to our core go-to-market strategy of operating the best possible hardware coupled with offering consumers the cruise vacation with the best value proposition, allowing us to source the highest quality guest to our brands, which in turn drive the highest yield. The first initiative of the Oceania program is $100 million enhancement to our four R-class vessels, which will include complete refurbishment of each and every stateroom and the reimagination of all public areas from dining rooms to bars and lounges. And while the OceaniaNEXT program results in an increased number of dry-dock days for the brand in 2019 over 2018, the work and investment will pay off handsomely beginning in 2020 as a freshly refurbished fleet and sends past and new guests alike to sail on a better than new ships, further stimulating overall demand and commanding higher prices. One additional initiative for driving demand that we are very excited about is the evolution and extension of our go-to-market bundling strategy. The Norwegian Cruise Line brand, Free at Sea offering has been an incredible success with both consumers and travel agents and is the primary driver behind why NCLH, both the highest ticket and highest onboard revenue yield of the three public cruise companies and by a wide margin. So I challenged the Norwegian team to add even more value to our bundle offerings and to provide an even more inclusive and compelling value proposition to consumers. The result is Norwegian brands recently launched Free Air, which seamlessly bundles airfare with and compliments Free at Sea offerings of free open bar, free specialty dining, free shore excursions, free WiFi, and kids sail free and one inclusive cruise fare. The advantages of this next evolution of our unique bundling strategy are many. First, it overcomes a major hurdle of what high yielding long haul customers need and want, easy to book in affordable air transportation. The success of Free at Sea has demonstrated that there is overwhelming demand for an inclusive contemporary cruise product. Free Air is the natural extension of that strategy. Secondly, travel agents are further incentive to market and sell the Norwegian brands products over those of competitors given the opportunity to earn additional commission on air inclusive packages. And third, the offerings strategically focuses on capturing more long haul, flight crews guests, reinforcing our strategy of sourcing the highest quality guests as long haul guests tend to be higher paying consumers both in ticket purchase and in onboard spend versus short haul dry cruise customers. Last and certainly not least, the more inclusive offering, the more enables us to drive higher pricing and better margins, which we are clearly seeing in our results. We recently tested this strategy and the newly launched posts, China itineraries for voyages on Norwegian Joy, whose booking window is approximately nine months or 50% shorter than usual due to the timing of her deployment announcement from China to Alaska. The program has proved a great success and we have been selectively rolled our Free Air across additional itineraries where air transportation is a major purchase consideration. With the program's success, we will look to provide even more avenues for guests to take advantage of this special value add offering in the near future. I will go into more details on what is on the horizon for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in 2019 a little later, but now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to review results for the quarter and provide guidance for the rest of the year. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2018 and 2017 net yields and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel for Capacity Day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our third quarter results, followed by color on booking trends, and will then discuss our guidance for fourth quarter and full-year 2018 and closed with a few item to consider as we look into 2019. Throughout my commentary, I will be referring to the Slide presentation, which Andrea mentioned earlier in the call. I am pleased to report yet another record quarter, one where the company generated the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in its history. Slide 4 summarizes how our adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 exceeded expectations by $0.07, primarily driven by $0.02 of revenue outperformance from strong well-priced close in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue, a $0.02 benefit in fuel expense driven by better than expected fuel consumption, efficiency from our new builds and benefits from continued to energy savings initiatives, which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. And a $0.02 benefit resulting from the timing of certain ship operating costs, which have shifted into the fourth quarter and the remainder, comes from other below the line items. Turning to Slide 5, net yield increased 4% or 3.9% on an as reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations by 50 basis points. The beat was driven by strong well-priced, close in bookings, and exceptionally strong onboard revenue across all major revenue streams. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which garnered yields above the NCLH corporate average in the quarter. Our third quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 2.25%, which excludes approximately 50 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations related to the itinerary optimization. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel increased 2% versus prior year and 2.1% on an as reported basis, slightly favorable to our guidance due to the timing of certain costs. Our total fuel expense was favorable versus expectations as fuel consumption savings more than offset and increase in fuel price per metric ton net of hedges which came in at $510. Now let's discuss capacity and deployment for the fourth quarter. Capacity is expected to increase approximately 7.7% primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Bliss into the fleet. Approximately 46% of our capacity is deployed in the Caribbean in line with the prior year. Highlights for the Regent and the quarter, including Norwegian Bliss, which is selling her first winter season for Miami. Additionally, Norwegian Breakaway will homeport for the first time from New Orleans operating in Western Caribbean itinerary. She will be Norwegians largest and newest ship to sail from the big easy and we are excited to bring this innovative Breakaway Class ship to this new homeport. Europe represents approximately 13% of our deployment down slightly from prior year. As for other key markets, Asia, Africa, Pacific accounts for approximately 13%, Hawaii 4% with the remaining balance of our deployment, comprised of repositioning Cruises, South America sailings, as well as Panama Canal and Mexican Riviera voyages. Our expectations for the fourth quarter can be found on Slide 6. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 4% or 3.75% on an as reported basis. This growth comes despite headwinds from the higher than expected revenue impact from China's sailings related to the itinerary optimizations discussed on our last call. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which is garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average while sailing in the Caribbean. Net yield growth is expected to be approximately 4.25%, which excludes approximately 75 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 1.5% or 1.75% on an as reported basis. Primarily due to additional marketing investments to support the new itineraries launched as part of the aforementioned itinerary optimization and to drive 2019 and 2020 bookings. All of which will be funded by a one-time benefit as a result of certain tax planning initiatives. And increasing the accrual of performance related compensation due to higher confidence that certain annual performance targets will be achieved at year end and the timing of certain expenses between the third and fourth quarters. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $484 with expect to consumption of approximately 215,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $0.78, a 15% increase over prior year. Slide 7 outlines our latest guidance for the full-year. Adjusted net yield is expected to increased approximately 3.3% or 3.6% on an as reported basis, which represents a 130 basis point increase versus our initial 2018 guidance provided in February, excluding new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand, net yield is expected to be up 3.8%, which excludes approximately 30 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Turning to costs adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel is expected to be up 2% or 2.5% on an as reported basis. The increase versus prior guidance is attributed to the aforementioned sales and marketing investments and increase performance incentive compensation. Looking at fuel expense, our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges is expected to be $480 with expected consumption of approximately 817,000 metric tons. Fuel consumption favorability is being offset by higher fuel prices for the remainder of the year. As a result of these revised expectations are improved adjusted EPS outlook of approximately $4.85 once again surpasses the high end of our previous guidance range and represents a 22.5% growth which comes on top of prior years strong growth of 16%. Slide 8 walks through the components of the $0.10 raise in our adjusted EPS guidance. $0.04 is attributable to the revenue outperformance, half of which comes from the third quarter and the other half from operational performance in the fourth quarter, partially offset by approximately $0.02 from incremental revenue dilution from China operations. A $0.04 benefit from lower depreciation and amortization, a $0.05 benefit as a result of tax planning initiatives, which is fully offsetting the $0.05 increase in certain net cruise costs. And the remaining benefit is due to a slight improvement for outlook and interest expense and other below the line items. Our margins continue to expand in 2018 with further expansion expected in 2019 and beyond. As we leverage our growth profile to drive topline results while are razor-sharp focus on controllable costs is complemented by the scale benefit we will enjoy from the launch of new ships into our fleet. As for the balance sheet, it continues to strengthen and we expect to be approximately 3.3x leveraged at the end of 2018 and are on track to reach our targeted leverage range of 2.5x to 2.75x by the end of 2020. In addition, we are also on track to deliver on our 2020 adjusted EPS CAGR, adjusted ROIC and shareholder return targets we provided at Investor Day, which are illustrated on Slide 9. This comes despite headwinds from rising fuel prices and fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Now I'd like to provide some context on 2019 expectations. The year is shaping up extremely well as the robust looking environment for cruise vacations remains healthy, bolstered by our successful demand generation initiatives, resulting in strong demand across our three brands. And while we expect 2019 earnings growth in the single-digit range for a multitude of reasons, the core fundamentals of our business are strong and fully intact. Next year's earnings growth is a reflection of the timing of our newbuilds deliveries coupled with our investment in the strategic itinerary optimization initiative, which are both expected to benefit future period results and bolster shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. And let's not forget 2019 is lapping extraordinary financial results with 2018 earnings growth of 22.5%. Now let's walk through a few items to keep in mind as we move into next year. First, as previously discussed, our strategic itinerary optimization initiative is expected to drive strong organic net yield growth, primarily as a result of Norwegian Joy's redeployment. However, at the same time, one-time cost related to the initiative including a non-cash write-off of approximately $25 million are expected to mostly offset the incremental revenue and related contribution generated in 2019. Both our net yield and our net cruise cost metrics will increase, resulting in only a slight accretion to adjusted earnings per share for the year. In 2020 and beyond we expect to realize the full earnings power from this strategic initiative with accretion to adjusted EPS expected to be approximately $0.30. Second, the first quarter is expected to be the lowest yield growth quarter as a result of the shift of the Easter Holiday into the second quarter of 2019 as well as Joy\u2019s final China sailings during the low season. Third, our incremental marketing costs associated with the new deployments of the vessels involved in the optimization initiative as well as launch an inaugural expenses for Norwegian Encore and Seven Seas Splendor as they do not enter the fleet until November 2019 in January 2020 respectively. Concurrently higher fuel pricing is expected to dry fuel costs net of hedges approximately 10% higher versus 2018 expectations. Lastly, there are nine schedule dry docks for the year, including six of the 10 shifts in the combined high yielding Oceania and Regent fleet. Turning back to the fuel environment. As the 2020 IMO regulations approach, we strategically layered on additional MGO hedges for both 2019 and 2020 to mitigate our exposure to the markets. As a result, we currently have 55% and 49% of our total fuel consumption hedge in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Also in an effort to improve the future correlation between our hedge proxy and the price we pay at the pump, we switched our proxy for hedging MGO from Brent to gas oil. As a refined distillate product similar to MGO, gas oil is expected to better protect against the risk of increased pricing spreads as opposed to Brent. As we look beyond 2020, we expect to equip our to Breakaway Class ships with exhaust gas cleaning systems, which will further insulate us from higher fuel prices starting in 2021. As a reminder, all of our installations are closed-loop systems, which is a higher standard than that of current regulations. To recap, as you can see on Slide 10, we've delivered another record quarter with the highest revenue and earnings in our Company's history. We have once again increased our full-year outlook about the high-end of previous guidance. We have strong conviction in our 2019 outlook and are well-positioned to achieve our 2020 targets and provide further shareholder returns. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. As Mark just stated, 2019 is indeed shaping up very well and I want to reiterate a statement I made on our last call, which is that the robust macroeconomic environment that is driving strong demand to our three brands shows no signs of weakening. That continue elongated booking curve confirms that customers are willing to book further out than ever before and commit to big ticket discretionary purchases months and even years in advance. Looking closer in consumers sailing today are generating levels of onboard spend that are the highest we have ever seen? Combined we get a clear picture of a consumer that is both confident today and confident of what their financial situation will be in the future. The underlying and sustainable strength in global demand for cruise vacation combined with the benefits from our newbuild and fleet refurbishment programs, the boost from our itinerary optimization initiatives and the competence in achieving our long-term financial targets all come together to give Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a compelling set of catalysts to drive multiple expansion and total shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond. We are extremely proud of the strong results we have posted thus far and we are even more excited to maximize the opportunities that lay in front of us. Once again, I thank you for your support. Jonathan. We can now open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Instinet. Your question please. Harry Curtis : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Frank, if you go back a year ago, your tone on the third quarter call was quite positive. So to borrow a statement from Ronald Reagan, I'm trying to get a sense of are you even better off today as you look into 2019 than this time last year? And if you have some detail to share with us, that'd be helpful. Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Harry. It's a good question especially coming on the heels of this past Tuesday and the election, but yes, I feel better today than I did this time last year. We\u2019re better booked across our three brands. We\u2019re better booked at higher prices. We don't have the overhang today that we had a year ago vis-a-vis the Caribbean and the hurricane. So all told, I see a broader picture. We see it in organic pricing improvement, we see it in the early results of our itinerary optimization initiatives, and we see it in the early bookings on Encore. During the commentaries I just finished, I mentioned two data points that I think economists and market watchers and investors should always look at the cruise industry as the leading economic indicator. Our record book position is an indication of how consumers are feeling for the future. What they're spending onboard today is a great read as to how they're feeling today. But I'll give you one more indicator and that is the performance of our onboard future cruise sales programs. This is a program where we have onboard all the vessels, but particularly at the Norwegian brand. That business is up 36% year-over-year. It's another sign that the consumer is feeling good at the time \u2013 and on the current time and feeling good enough to buy another cruise while there is still on their existing cruise. So again, it's another indicator that the consumer is alive and well today and feeling good about the future. And the last thing I'll tell you is is that I know it's early, but the booking curve is getting a little longer, especially for the upscale brands. We've got sailing \u2013 we've got brands I should say that already more than 20% booked for 2020, and that's the earliest that we've ever reached that milestone. So yes, am I better off today than I was certainly four years ago, but even a year ago as well there Harry. Harry Curtis : So I did have a second part to this one question. And maybe Mark can help us understand, there seems to be an awful lot of repositioning and pre-launch costs going into next year. Do you have a sense of what sort of an EPS drag that is having without associated revenues that come the following year? Mark Kempa : Yes. So as you know, we are launching Encore in the latter part of 2019 and Seven Seas Splendor in January 2020. So we have to have marketing costs associated with that throughout the year plus the normal inaugural costs. So if you look at that all in, we typically spend $5 million to $7 million somewhere in that zone for launch costs. And then on top of that you have your pre-marketing, so probably thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $15 million to $20 million drag on 2019 earnings without associated earnings power. Harry Curtis : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your question please. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good morning. Mark, when you were talking about the fourth quarter, you were talking about a variety of puts and takes to the net yields. It was a little fast for me and I can get that from the transcript later, but I'm really just trying to figure out when you look at the fourth quarter, the difference between what you're seeing now versus what you were seeing in August to the extent there was any improvement. And also to the extent that there might potentially be upset in the fourth quarter, where do you think that's coming from? In other words, are you still booked that maybe it's not close in bookings; it might be coming from the onboard strength that Frank was talking about. Just wondering if you could bifurcate that? And then also regarding the 2019 booking curve, Frank, you just talked about how far it was out. It was 2020. Just wondering for those bookings that are coming in 2020, is that mostly Prestige and Oceania? Are you seeing any kind of farther out than expected bookings coming in for the Norwegian brands? Frank Del Rio : Mark's got the long question. So I'll give you the short answer. All three brands are ahead in 2020, but the bulk of the bookings are for the two upscale brands. Mark Kempa : Yes. Regarding 4Q yields, yields are coming in exactly where we thought, in our last guidance. We did see a little bit of additional drag from a revenue dilution in China. So if you strip that out, that was about 75 basis points in the quarter. So if you strip that out, our guidance for the quarter is right on par with our previous guidance. We are substantially booked for the remainder of the quarter. However, we have been seeing exceptionally strong onboard revenue. We saw it in the third quarter. We're seeing it in the early signs of the fourth quarter. We're now what, five weeks into the quarter and we've seen very healthy onboard revenue, which as we always say is a good indicator of consumer confidence. So I think any upside in the quarter is really going to be driven by onboard and we're feeling pretty good about it. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, thanks. And just a quick housekeeping Mark, you increased CapEx in each of 2018 and 2019 by about $100 million. Is that mostly technology related, I'm just trying to figure out how that might flow through to DNA 2019 and 2020? Mark Kempa : Yes, I think 2019 is really \u2013 if you recall, on our last call, we had announced Norwegian Joy's $50 million investment, when she goes into dry dock next year. So that that increased 2019 and that will reporting in billions, the remainder is really just rounding. So I would not read into that other than the incremental portion from Norwegian Joy. And just keep in mind to what the Joy, she is going to be out of service for approximately 47 days next year of which a roughly 21 days or dry docks. So as you think about 2019 that that's going to have that's going to influence our crews cost metrics. We will also get the same benefit from her increased revenue on our yield metrics, but as we stated, it'll be a route only a slight accretion to EPS. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel, your question please. Steven Wieczynski : Yes. Hey guys. Good morning. And I understand you're not going to give guidance today for 2019, and you've talked about \u2013 even talked this morning about how for 2019 you're kind of still expecting a single-digit EPS growth rate over 2018. But I guess the question is, do you still feel like, in terms of what you're seeing right now in terms of 2019, you sounded very positive, Frank, with the strength and booking patterns of onboard stays the same, a fuel is not a major impact, FX not an impact. Could you guys actually get north of 10% earnings growth next year? I'm not sure you'll answer that or not. Frank Del Rio : If you're giving me an odd, I'll take it. But look we strive to squeeze every dollar we can out of revenue in the same amount of cost. It's going to be very difficult to do so. We're not suggesting that we are at this very early stage. Perhaps as we gained some traction under our belt, we can give you a clear picture. But today a truly we think it's going to be a fantastic year in organic growth. But as you know, in this business, the real boost to a year-over-year earnings growth is new capacity and we have limited new capacity next year. Mark Kempa : Yes, and I'll just add and again reminder, we're rolling over a 22.5% growth in 2018, so as we continue to out perform this year, it does make for a difficult comp in 2019. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, gotcha. Thanks. And then the second question, Frank, I liked your color on your Free Air promotion. We've got a ton of questions about this, over the past couple of weeks and we get the sense that investors have a sense that you're doing this because demand is weakening. It's pretty clear from your prepared remarks that doesn't seem to be the case. But I guess the question is can you help us understand how bookings have trended since that promotion was announced or maybe how has your web traffic or inbound inquiries changed since that promotion was announced or maybe how is your web traffic or inbound inquiries changed since that promotion was announced. Frank Del Rio : Yes, Steve, good question. I'm going to let Andy Stuart. He is much closer to this and I am answering your question. Andrew Stuart : Yes. Thanks Steve. Free Air has been a runaway success for us. I'll stop there. Frank talked in his opening commentary about how we tested it initially on Norwegian Joy. And the results on Norwegian Joy were not only a significant increase in bookings, but pricing was also up overall as a result of the Free Air promotion. Because what you get is you get some people who booked inclusive product and some people who buy cruise only. And the result of that mix is that you end up with a higher overall pricing outcome. So we're very happy with it. We are in the early days of the initiative. It\u2019s 100% strategic initiative. Our goal here is to evolve the bundling strategy that has been so successful for us. We're now evolving the marketing to bring in Free Air, but we've seen tremendous growth in web traffic as we've launched the Free Air promotion and we've seen an increase in bookings and we've seen an increase in the resulting price. This has been a great success for us and you can really expect us to expand it a little bit as we move forward. Frank Del Rio : It's a great differentiator Steve in the marketplace. Just about everybody else focuses only on price, price, price and as you know, early on in my tenure here, we brought a different philosophy to the table, the bundling strategy, the go-to-market strategy and we are continuing to evolve and extend that strategy that proved so successful first at Oceania and in Regent and now at Norwegian. And again, I'll stress to you that as a result of that, the result of our go-to-market strategy, the result of our refurbishment program, the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings company has the highest ticket yield and the highest onboard yield by a very, very wide margin. And so we think that we continued on that track. It's proven to be successful and the Free Air program is another example of that. Steven Wieczynski : Great. Thanks guys. Appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your question please. Jared Shojaian : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, you talked about how at the turn of the next year you'll be 65% booked. Can you just remind us how that compares to when you entered 2016? And I asked because 2016 I think was the year that was shaping up rate to before we had a lot of unexpected headwinds that happened during the year. And I guess related to that, is there anything that's different now versus then in terms of maybe more nonrefundable deposits or anything else that can make next year more stable than I guess what we saw in 2016 when again, you did have many unexpected headwinds? Frank Del Rio : Yes. So we turned 2016 at roughly 50%, so to be able to improve over a two year period 30% at higher prices I think is significant and goes to our go-to-market strategy et cetera. And I'm always asked what's the ideal booking curve? And I tell folks, I don't know, I do know that as long as we can continue to extend, hold the booking curve about where it is, we think it's pretty close to ideal and we can continue to raise prices that it's a good thing. And so we're very pleased with that. In terms of what else we see in 2019 that are positive. Certainly we're eager to a reposition Joy into western itineraries, especially Alaska. She's performing very well. Bliss did a tremendous job and opening up that market for Joy. She's a sister ship to Joy and the marketplace understands that. If you recall in 2016, the Eastern Mediterranean was in shambles. Today, it's not in shambles, but it is an improving situation. We'll have 15 sailings that touched Turkish ports, growing to 23 in 2020. And I think that \u2013 if those itineraries in 2019 and in 2020 perform well and so far \u2013 let me just reject that the 15 sailings in 2019 are performing better both in load and in pricing than those itineraries around it, either before or immediately after that don't have a Turkish ports. I think if that trend continues and it continues in 2020, that you can see the industry and certainly us returning to the Eastern Med in a much bigger way in 2021. This is a very much a forward looking business and you have to introduce itineraries way in advance. And so it's difficult to turn on a dime, but we're seeing positive trends in the Eastern Med, which we hope can continue. If you recall prior to the situations that occurred in the Eastern Med, the Eastern Med was about 5% of our capacity at very, very high yields. And so that is certainly something that could be a catalyst in the future. And in terms of 2019, we are less dependent on the North American consumer today than we were back then. We've done a great job internationally to get the international customer, sourcing international customers that are a higher caliber, meaning that they're willing to pay ticket prices on par with the North American. And also our Premium All Inclusive program that we rolled out throughout the international community ensures us that the onboard spend by the international customer is also a closer to what we expect the North Americans, which is the best onboard customer there is. So overall, I see less risk in the system primarily because of some of these initiatives that we've taken to diversify our sourcing better fleet overall, and so that's one of the reasons why I feel better today than I did a year ago. Jared Shojaian : That's helpful. Thank you. And you Frank, I appreciate all the demand commentary, which sounds great. And I'm going to be even more shortsighted here for a second. You talked about the past 13 weeks. I think they have been great and accelerating. But what about in the last four or five weeks, really since we've started to see a lot of the volatility creep into the market? They\u2019re seems to be more just I think broad macro concerns. Are you seeing any of that manifest into like again, like the last four or five weeks because I know historically a lot of wild swings in the markets has tended to impact booking activity or are you seeing any of that right now? Frank Del Rio : No, Jared, we track a last 16 last 12, last four, last week and yesterday. And I can tell you that we don't see any, any marked difference in bookings and consumer behavior and what they're booking. We didn't see it when the markets went down 600 points. We didn't see it when the markets go up 500 points. It's pretty stable. And I think it speaks to the overall resiliency that the cruise industry is known for. It takes a lot more than, three or four weeks of volatility in the stock market to affect our overall booking patterns. Jared Shojaian : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour from JPMorgan. Your question please. Brandt Montour : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So on Alaska, which is obviously going to be big for you guys next year and given the repositioning of Joy there. At your Investor Day, you mentioned that it was becoming a bit of a crowded place, but that you were working on additional ports and so forth. Can you just give us an update on the supply and demand dynamics in that market at the industry level and then how you're positioning the Joy relative to the Bliss in terms of itineraries and the like? Frank Del Rio : So I'll start by saying that in 2018, we saw a 15% increase in capacity and we were able to grow pricing 25%. So I think Alaska is a market that is under supplied, if you will. There is great demand for it. It's safe. Americans want to visit the last frontier and I think that there's much more room to grow. So for 2019, we're growing our capacity because a full-year of Bliss. Bliss got there a little bit later than it normally would. And then of course the full season of Joy, we're growing our capacity 30% and I think the industry at large is growing in the mid-teens. So it's going to be interesting. The good news is that across our three brands today, we are ahead of where we were this time last year. Pricing, a strong Joy is being positioned as a sister ship to the most successful shift ever introduced in Alaska, Norwegian Bliss. And so we think we've got the best hardware combination in Alaska with a Joy and Bliss, a beautifully new renovated Norwegian Jewel that just came out of an extensive dry dock two days ago. And then of course the Oceana Regatta and the Regent Mariner Seven Seas that just generate incredible yields. Both ticket in onboard for the Oceana and Regent brand. So we were bullish on Alaska. We think there's more room to grow. We think there's opportunities for us to deploy additional tonnage to Alaska in the years to come. We're looking to make a strategic infrastructure investments in Alaska that allows us to grow our presence there. And so we're bullish and were long so to speak in Alaska. Brandt Montour : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up on fuel. If you could just kind of talk about the curve realizing that a bunker pricing hasn't really sold off to the same extent that WTI has recently. But aside from that the curve for heavy fuel if you just some relief early into next year ahead of the 2020 event. And we're just wondering if that's baked into your fuel expense comments from 2019 that that you said earlier? Frank Del Rio : Yes. Since our last earnings call, the curves have increased roughly 9% to 10%. They've been pretty volatile. So that's why we wanted to give some color on 2019 that we expect our total fuel costs to be up about 10% for 2019 over 2018 levels. And then as you fast forward into that in 2020 and 2021 fuel generally represents about 6% to 7% of our gross revenues. And I think as you look into 2020, everything we see right now given where our exhaust gas cleaning program is going to be and other initiatives that we're working on. I think fuel is going to represent probably on the upper range of that 6% to 7%. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did late \u2013 we are layering on additional hedging for both 2019 and 2020 with a heavy focus on 2020, but also a heavy focus on the back half of 2019 because we believe we're going to start to see that fuel creeps somewhere in the latter part of the year. So as of this call, we're roughly 55% hedge for next year and almost 50%, 49% to be exact for 2020. So we are lucky with something we'd look at every day and we're taking advantage of opportunities and dips in the market to remove as much as the volatility as we can. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Your question please. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. I'm obviously very strong outlook here. I just wonder if I had to add the short-term question, but I guess there's just been different commentary from others in the market about Q1, aside from the Easter shift, the Calendar shift? When you look at Caribbean for Q1, I guess, how should we think about the fact that we've passed Fletcher's hurricanes and so the booking period in September and October has been stronger since then, but with passengers booking three to six months out that maybe we don't start to see that show up in the price of cruises taken for another three to six months. What's I guess, what is the expectation we should have about Caribbean and in Q1 you're outside of that shift. In other words, is do you see the improvement comping hurricanes last year occurring before Q1 or not until after Q1? Mark Kempa : Yes, I'll say that Robin is most of the capacities in the Norwegian brand. Overall for the Caribbean, as we look at our called Caribbean product we're very happy. We sort of look at a season. We take the November to April season, as the Caribbean and with upon pricing upon low, feeling really good about that. We look out all of 2019 upon pricing upon low. So pricing for the full-year for next year looks pretty good for the Caribbean. I think we have the opportunity to continue to improve as we last the hurricane. We definitely had some load challenges last year in the wake of the hurricane, so we should see some benefit from that. So we're feeling optimistic about the Caribbean. Norwegian Bliss in the same way that she hit records in Alaska, she hit records in the Mexican Riviera is getting the same reception as she comes to the Caribbean and her performance. So Bliss is a very, very strong performer in the Caribbean. And as we look further out into the year, Encore, as Frank said in his remarks is looking very, very strong for the early indications from her introduction. So generally feeling positive about the Caribbean. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. And then just one follow-up on expenses. I know you're not done, budgeting for 2019 yet, but it sounds like you do have the dry-docks part of it planned. I wonder if you could just give us \u2013 just the dry-docks, what kind of impact that might have on expense? All things equal and understanding that other things maybe up and down, but just the dry-dock impact on next year. And also if you have the marketing impact, which I don't know if that's final or not, but at least maybe dry-docks you could say, is 100 basis points or less or more of non-cruise or non-fuel cruise? Mark Kempa : Yes. I think when you look at dry-docks 2019 versus 2018, we do have slightly few more days in 2019 primarily as result of the Joy dry-dock, which is about 21 days, if I recall correctly. And then in 2018, our total dry-dark days were somewhere in the neighborhood, I think 107 or 108. So excluding Joy, we're pretty much on par. And again, if you think of Joy as I said earlier, she was going to skew our yield metrics up, but she will also skew our net cruise cost up, so that it's going to be marginally accretive at the bottom line, including the write-off. But really the only incremental is really around that Joy dry-dock. And that's not going to be a huge cost driver because a lot of what we're doing will be capitalized to where the basis of the ship because the major improvements we're making to make her equally or is better than Norwegian Bliss. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Stephen Grambling : Hey, good morning. I guess I understand that you haven't seen any sign of consumer duress, but perhaps is another way of approaching the investor concern. If you think about the business today versus prior downturns, what aspects of either the industry or Norwegian specifically do you think positions the company different if the environment were to deteriorate? Mark Kempa : Good morning, Stephen. It\u2019s going to be a long answer because there's a lot of different things. First of all compared to the last downturn of 2008, you've got a much different balance sheet. This company has a very strong balance sheet as we know down to the low-3s and now has three brands, two of the brands which are much more resilient to your garden variety recession because of the luxury customer just does well in all types of economic environment. But perhaps the most important is what we've introduced in the Norwegian brand and our go-to-market strategy of both bundling the product, so that we always provide the greatest value to the consumer. And I think value to the consumer is always important. But in times of duress, consumers doubled down on value. And so we believe that our go-to-market strategy of bundling will be a differentiator in the marketplace that will be appreciated, and in case of a downturn as much, if not more as being appreciated today. And then our go-to-market strategy of market. The last thing we want to do is discount. Those that discounted heavily to survive in the last downturn paid a heavy price for years and years to come and I daresay there are still some companies who haven't reached their pre-financial downturn yield levels. Whereas in our company of the three brands that we operate today, one of them Regent never missed a beat year-after-year 2009 was better than a way, I believe Oceania missed it by a year and Norwegian missed it by two years. So we think that our go-to-market philosophy and strategy is a competitive advantage. And quite frankly, one of the reasons why the Free Air program is something that we're excited about and will evolve at the Norwegian brand like it evolve years ago at the Regent brand. And without question in the Regent brand is the most successful by any metric of the luxury brand. We\u2019ve got new hardware, and not just new hardware, but quite frankly, a hardware that is innovative. No one else has three ships with a two decker gold cart track on top, and everybody just wants to go on the gold cart. So I'm a very different company and I'll say one more before I forget. I told you to be a long answer and that is our international sourcing back in a way. All three of our brands, we're very much North American centric today. We saw it\u2019s a greater percentage of our business, internationally and that area is growing. And the international guests is one that is, like we said before, on par with the domestic customers, so very, very much different environment, much less risk to the system. Stephen Grambling : So I guess a follow-up on that. What percentage of your onboard spending is paid before someone steps on the ship? And maybe within that, what's the mix of your onboard spend right now, especially this we looked at maybe like casino? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Yes, Steven. So we don't disclose that level of detail. How much is pre-booked? But what I can tell you is that, over the years, we continue to make progress in that arena and we are investing in technology. We want to get more of the consumer's wallet upfront prior to stepping onboard the ship. So and onboard, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's looking good in Q3. We're seeing good signs and Q4, it is strong, that's the canary in the coal mine. So we're seeing strength there. But we're continually continuously making investments to try enough and grabbed that wallet earlier. And, can I give you specifics on casino? But I can tell you, casino has been very, very healthy and that that comes in contrast to, I think some of the reports we saw yesterday with some of the operators, a casino operators, but our channel in that arena has been extremely strong this year and it continues to be. Stephen Grambling : Great. That's all helpful color. Thanks so much. Frank Del Rio : Jonathan, we got time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question please. Timothy Conder : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. The infrastructure investments Mark, you alluded to that and Frank, I think you talked or looked at about Alaska being one. If you could maybe expand on that and then any destination development, port develop you're doing? And I guess that's \u2013 it goes subset obviously of the broader capital deployment strategy here. The deleveraging and it sounds like you're looking to be more potentially opportunistic as far as share repo and maybe as we get further into the back half of 2019 versus the front half of 2019, is that a fair way to characterize it? Mark Kempa : Yes, so as you know, we do have $800 million of our available, $1 billion share repurchase program left. And I think our stated position as we said at investor day. We want to hit our year end leverage targets in the low-3s, and we said we want to \u2013 we're going to \u2013 we expect to be there at three, three. Now if there is dips in the market, we may take advantage of that, but we're cognizant of our leverage and we want to ensure we hit that. As for 2019, again we do have scheduled capital deployment, which we believe is going to be a balanced mix of a share repurchases and potentially dividends, if we do, if we instituted a dividend in 2019, which is at the pure discretion of our board of course. It would probably most likely be in the latter half of 2019. But that's something that we discussed continuously with our board and we'll give more color on in throughout the year in 2019. Then I think your other portion was Alaska in infrastructure? Frank Del Rio : I think the investment in infrastructure is as the industry grows and preferential birthing becomes a more important than ever. We are competing with our peers in the marketplace. So having those preferential birthing rights throughout the more popular destinations that we and they of cruise too. And so that's what we're doing. We're looking at places like Alaska. We're looking at places in the Caribbean \u2013 in Mexico, so we're doing what others are doing as well. And that is to protect or to I should say guaranteed that our ships have a place to the birth in these popular destinations. Timothy Conder : Okay, and if I may throw one last one here. Frank, we talked about one-year ago, and then \u2013 better off four years ago, all that here, but how would you frame that as far as your customer demographics? How has that changed a multigenerational, the differences in the age putting. Of course, if he would sort of pro form with the Oceania and Regent included in the whole corporate holding structure. Frank Del Rio : Well, I don't think it's changed a whole lot year-over-year. I mean, the millennial is still a growing part of about the Norwegian customer mix. But the baby boomers still make up the majority of the customers that bought a Norwegian vessel. Let's not forget 10,000 of them retire every day and they've got both the time and money to take a cruise. And certainly at the Oceana and the Regent brand. It is almost exclusively a baby boomers and it has been, in the last \u2013 for the last 15 years, I don't see that changing anytime soon given the longer itineraries that those brands operate in at the much higher prices that they operate. So across the Board, I don't see a shift from one type of consumer to another. Other than that we've \u2013 we're consciously going after that high quality, high caliber, international customer to compliment, the North American consumer. because they're the ones who generate the highest ticket and the highest onboard. And again, I will point you to all the AQs that are out there of what the net onboard yields are for the Norwegian brand nearly $78 a day over the last 12 months. That is a somewhere between 50% and 75% higher than others. It's a huge competitive advantage and one that we focused on very much so which is why we've got such a leadership position in that space Timothy Conder : Okay. Thank you gentlemen for the color. End of Q&A Frank Del Rio : Thank you very much. Well, it's been another wonderful time to spend with you this morning. I thank everyone for your support and your time and as always, we will be available to answer your questions throughout the day. Thank you very much.

My name is Liz, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions for the session will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer; and Andy Stuart, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter and full-year as well as provide guidance for 2019 before handing the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations Web site at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make references to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations Web site. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results was issued this morning, and is available on our Investor Relations Web site. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning everyone. The team at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings delivered what can only be described as a breakout year in 2018, with several key milestones and notable accomplishments achieved. The highlights of which appear on slide four of the accompanying presentation. I'd like to take just a few moments to recognize and thank the 33,000-plus team members across our organization and around the world for their remarkable contributions to our record results, and for their dedication and passion in providing exceptional vacation experiences and world-class hospitality to the 2.8 million guests who sailed the seven seas aboard our 26 ships last year. We started 2018 in a record book position. And while I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, I am pleased to report that we started 2019 in a book position that is even better. I'll discuss more about 2019 later in my commentary. For 2018, stronger than anticipated demand and robust onboard spend across all these brands and across all source and destination markets, along with the launch of the most successful new build in Norwegian's history propelled adjusted earnings per share and net yield growth well past what were already high expectations at the beginning of the year. Norwegian Bliss was indeed a major driver of this outperformance. When we launched her in April, the expectation was for strong performance and pricing premiums on par with other new build introductions. But instead, we have experienced performance that can only be described as extraordinary, with demand, ticket pricing, and onboard revenue metrics that have all shattered records and surpassed our highest expectations. And if you worry that Bliss might only be a one-year wonder, please note that in month where 2019 last for 2018 debut, her ticket yields are equal to and in some months slightly higher than her inaugural season. A follow-up performance seldom is ever seen in our industry. In 2018, we achieved record highs in several key financial metrics, including revenue, which surpassed $6 billion, and GAAP net income, which was just shy of reaching the $1 billion milestone, along with adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and most notably, a net ticket and net onboard revenue yield where we continue to lead the industry by an extraordinarily wide margin. As you can see on slide five and six, we not only led the industry in net ticket, net onboard, and total net yield in 2018, but also in revenue growth, which had 12.2% on capacity growth of just 8.5%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 24%, and an EBITDA per capacity day. These highs helped extend our hard-fought and lengthy track record of strong financial performance. This past year marked our fifth consecutive year double-digit earnings growth, our sixth consecutive year of net yield growth. And as shown on slide seven, over a decade of year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA with continued margin expansion. We also made meaningful progress towards achieving our Full Speed Ahead 2020 targets, which we set out at our investor day, last May. With two years left in our three-year plan we are more confident than ever in achieving our stated targets. In terms of financial performance, 2018 will certainly be remembered as a breakout year. But there were other significant events that also made this year so memorable. On the ownership front, we've reached an important milestone with the exit of our main sponsors, including Apollo Global Management, which exited its 11-year stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, concluding what was undoubtedly one of the firm's most profitable pre-financial crisis vintage investment. And as I'd previously mentioned, we took delivery of Norwegian Bliss, the most successful ship in Norwegian brand's 52-year history. We continue to see strong demand for her sailings in the Caribbean, and as previously noted, especially for her second Alaska season this coming summer. We also launched OceaniaNEXT, a multifaceted program including a complete re-inspiration of the brand's four classic vessels, along with more ambitious initiatives, which I will touch upon later. These achievements and milestones taken together have strengthened the financial and operational foundation of the long-term strategy we have laid out and positions us well as we move into 2019 and beyond. And just as we did in 2018, we entered the year in record book position and at record pricing, which has allowed us to capitalize on 2019 strong wave season, during which we have witnessed the highest pricing of source inventory in the history of the company. This achievement puts us in a strong position from which to continue driving meaningful price depreciation on remaining inventory, and to optimize the positioning and launch of our next new build, Norwegian Encore, which joins the fleet in late November. And while it is still early in the overall booking cycle, the strong demand we are experiencing across all brands and across all markets is also spilling over into 2020, with the company's three brands now substantially better booked and at higher prices than at this time last year for 2019. This robust performance has resulted in the booking curve extending approximately 9% over last year with our advanced ticket sales balance at year-end 2018 standing an impressive 22% higher than at year-end 2017. The underlying strength of this booking curve is best observed in our Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands, where each line is now better than 80% booked for 2019 sailing and nearly one-third booked for 2020 sailing, all at meaningfully higher prices to the previous years. From our vantage point, there does not seem to be a near-term end to the booking condition our company has and is experiencing. Our yield guidance for 2019, which Mark will cover in his commentary, gives everyone confidence about the state of the vacationing consumer, and therefore of our company's prospects, particularly those who are still concerned about where we are in the economic cycle, and those concerned with the higher-than-average industry capacity growth. Our Norwegian brand, for example, well in essence, launched three 4,000-passenger vessels, Norwegian Bliss, Joy, and Encore in a span of just 18 months, representing a 24% increase in the brand's capacity, making it by far the largest capacity increase in any 18-month period in our history. Bliss' stellar performance to date is well documented, and Norwegian Encore continues to be the best booked and highest priced Caribbean introduced ship in the Norwegian brand's history. But to also be able to absorb Norwegian Joy's deployment to Alaska and the Mexican Riviera, and to do so with a sales window that is only nine months or half as long as that of a typical ship introduction while still delivering strong pricing, should completely dispel any overcapacity fears at least as they pertain to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. This successful absorption of capacity demonstrates three things. First, that our go-to-market strategy and retail proposition, smart and disciplined marketing spend, and sophisticated revenue management practices which we purposely do not publicly discuss very much for competitive reasons, indeed drive quality demand and generate industry-leading financial results. Second, that 2019 marks the first in a four-year stretch of moderate capacity growth of the company with a CAGR of less than 4%, which bodes very well for our ability to profitably absorb future capacity increases while continuing to drive pricing higher. And third, there remain many attractive un-served and underserved markets, both domestically and globally, where our brands can deploy future capacity additions. Meanwhile, the Oceania and Regent brands, as I mentioned earlier, are enjoying record book position and strong pricing power of their own. So well booked are these brands for 2019, that they are now pivoting their marketing initiative earlier in the year than ever before to build an even stronger base for 2020 sailings, which include the introduction of the Regent Seven Seas Splendor and a full-year of sailings by the three of the four Oceania R-class ships that will have received extensive refurbishment under the OceaniaNEXT program. Turning to consumers, and despite stock market volatility, fear of trade wars, Brexit uncertainty, and other short-term disruptions, such as a recent government shutdown, our indications are that consumers remain confident in both the short and long-term, especially the all-important North American consumer, from which we enjoy an outsized benefit given our strategic sourcing mix and focus on global versus national brands. We are also benefiting on several other fronts. First, our go-to-market strategy and the sizeable marketing investments we have made to communicate the wonders of our three brands to travel agents and consumers has guests recognizing more and more the benefits of booking early to get the best and highest value. Our elongated booking window is proof of this. And another data point is the sale of future cruises onboard our ship. In 2018, all three of our brands experienced meaningful increases in the number of guests who booked their next cruise even before finishing their current one locking them in into future cruises while reducing marketing-related cost. Second, we are benefiting from the continued shift of consumer spent from material things to experiences. While the retail sector has been a mixed bag of data, the experience economy as we see has remained strong. And third, just as we are seeing consumer confidence in booking cruises further up, we are seeing equal confidence in their current spending as the onboard revenue continues to surpass the record levels of the prior year. Lastly, we continue to leverage the strong global demand environment with our expanded worldwide sales and marketing organization that allows to us further hone our best guest strategy which focuses on sourcing the best guest defined as the highest yielding guest regardless of their prominence. At the same time, our core markets remain strong. 2018 was the second consecutive year of double digit pricing growth in Europe driven by all three brands while 2019 is building on that solid foundation with pricing above last year's record level. In Alaska, despite industry capacity growth in the mid teens which includes our very own 27% increase in capacity, we expect another blockbuster season with Norwegian Joy joining Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Jewel. Norwegian Joy's reposition to Alaska has brought heightened attention to this market and to the Norwegian brand. Joy is booking well and at higher prices compared to the smaller vessels she replaced in our deployment despite her condensed nine-month booking window. And lastly, business in the Caribbean continues to accelerate. And we are pleased with our performance in the region as we await the late year introduction of the Norwegian Encore. For the historic -- historically 2019 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is taking shape. Our strong start to the year with a record book position, the successful absorption of a record capacity increase in the most profitable North American market, a confident consumer that is willing to book further and further out and is willing to spend more and more onboard. It all sounds to me like the making of an encore performance. I'll return at the end of the call to discuss our longer term initiatives. But now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our results and guidance in more detail. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2018 and 2017 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity data metric on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year results followed by color on booking trends and close with our guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2019. Throughout my commentary, I will be referring to the slide presentation which Andrea mentioned earlier in the call. I am pleased to report we have another record quarter one where the company generated the highest fourth quarter revenue and earnings in its history. Adjusted EPS of $0.85 exceeded expectations by $0.07. As you can see on Slide 8, the beat was driven by $0.02 of revenue outperformance from strong well-priced close in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue. A $0.04 benefit below the line from the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on our advanced ticket sales obligation which we expect to reverse in 2019 and will impact our reported revenue and yield metrics. And a $0.04 benefit for interest and other below the line items. All of which were partially offset by higher ship operating expenses as well as performance related compensation expense. Turning to Slide 9, net yield increased 4.7% or 4.2% on an as reported basis versus prior year outperforming guidance by 70 basis points. The beat was driven by strong well-priced, close in bookings, and exceptionally strong onboard revenue across all major revenue streams. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which garnered yields above the NCLH corporate average in the quarter, our fourth quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 4.5%, which excludes approximately 75 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations related to the itinerary optimization initiative. Turning to costs adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 3.6% versus prior year and 3.4% on an as reported basis. Our total fuel expense within line versus expectations as fuel consumption savings offset an increase in fuel prices per metric ton netted hedges which came in at $496. Turning to full-year results, 2018 finish strong and we delivered yet another record year of financial performance. Both revenue and earnings were the highest in our history and we achieved a record adjusted even a margin of 31.3% up from 30.7% in the prior year and expanded our double digit adjusted ROIC to 11%. Turning to slide 10, full-year adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $4.92 or $0.37 above the mid-point of our initial full-year guidance issued last February. This result comes despite a 7% impact from unfavorable fuel prices. Our performance in the top line from continued strong demand for our portfolio of products and Norwegian Bliss is record breaking -- season contributed to the beat the guidance. Revenue grew over 12% versus prior year, reaching a record $6.1 billion. Other key financial metrics for the full-year 2018, include net yield grow up 3.5% or 3.7% on an as reported basis which exceeded the mid-point of our prior guidance by 20 basis points. The year benefited from the successful introduction of Norwegian Bliss, strong demand for European sailings, additional high yielding sailing to Cuba well priced close in demand and stronger than expected on board revenue. Excluding new Norwegian Brand capacity, full-year net yield growth would have been approximately 3.8% which excludes approximately 30 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel increased 2.6% percent or 2.9% on an as reported basis. And fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges increased to $483 from $465 in the prior year. It's important to note overall fuel pricing decreased since our last call are substantial hedge position entering Q4 as well as the lag in the, at the pump pricing minimized any tail wind from the market declines. Shipping to 2019 on a full-year basis, our capacity is expected to nominally increase approximately 2.7%. With the annual nation of Norwegian Bliss along with the late November introduction of encore to the fleet partially offset by the approximately 50 day dry dock and re positioning for Norwegian Joy. As Frank mentioned earlier, 2019 is the first year and a four year stretch of moderate capacity growth for our company. I'll direct you to slide 11, to review some deployment highlights. For the year, a little over a third of our capacity is in the Caribbean which includes Norwegian Bliss and encores debut in the region. While capacity in Europe is up in the low teens as we deployed six Norwegian ships to that region in the peak summer. Norwegian Joy's redeployment result in a decrease in APAC share of our deployment and increases Alaska's share which equates to approximately 27% capacity increase in the region. First quarter deployment is similar to prior year with the exception of -- who share decreases of Norwegian Joy enters dry dock before re positioning to Alaska. Looking at expectations for the full-year on slide 12, strong booking trends have continued across all core markets at all three brands. Adjusted EPS for full-year 2019 is expected to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.30 or approximately 7% growth over prior year at the mid-point. This includes an adjustment for the onetime non-cash write-off in depreciation and amortization of approximately 25 million associated with Norwegian Joy's enhancements, which will make her even better than a record-breaking sister ship Norwegian Bliss. Since our last earnings call, we have seen a decrease in both fuel prices and interest rates, which has been partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, resulting in a net tailwind of approximately $0.10 per share. As previously discussed, our expectations for 2019 earnings growth in the high single digit range is primarily a result of four factors. First, we have moderate in your capacity growth of approximately 2.7%. Second, we are lacking extremely strong financial performance in 2018 with adjusted earnings growth of 24%. Third, we are incurring marketing and launch costs associated with two upcoming ship launches Norwegian Encore in late 2019 and Seven Seas Splendor in early 2020 with minimal in your contribution due to the timing of deliveries. And lastly, the itinerary optimization initiative skews both are yield and cost metrics higher in 2019 due to a partial year benefit from higher revenues, which will be substantially offset by the associated costs including the extended dry dock and repositioning for joy. NET yields for the year is expected to increase 3% to 4% or 2.5% to 3.5% on an as reported basis. This performance is on top of the already robust 3.8% growth we delivered in 2018, which excludes approximately 30 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. When excluding incremental capacity from Norwegians Bliss and Norwegian Encore, it results in only in marginal difference to our annual net yield guidance of 3% to 4%. Norwegian Bliss's Caribbean sailings are garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average and are offset by below corporate average yields when sailing in the Mexican Riviera. Concurrently, Encore's one month of revenue service does little to move the needle. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 3.25% or 2.75% on an as reported basis. This is primarily due to an increase in total dry dock days and associated costs versus prior year fewer capacity days, which increase our system-wide unit cost. Due to the approximate 50-day Norwegian Joy -- 50 days, Norwegian Joy will be out of service to complete her dry dock, reposition to Seattle and carry out inaugural activities. Incremental marketing costs associated with the deployments of the vessels involved and the itinerary optimization initiative and marketing and inaugural expense for Norwegian Joy Encore and Seven Sea Splendor. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $465 with expected consumption of approximately 860,000 metric tons. We have continued to strategically layer on additional NGO hedges for 2019 and 2020, and they're now hedging into 2021. As a result, we currently have 57%, 53% and 33% of our total fuel consumption hedged for 2019, 2020 and 2021. There are a few key items to keep in mind for the balance of 2019. When looking at the cadence of net yield growth. The first quarter is expected to be the lowest yield growth quarter primarily as a result of the Easter holiday shift into the second quarter as well as Norwegian Joy's final China sailings during the low-priced winter season. We expect net yield growth for the remaining three quarters to be relatively consistent, as Norwegian Joy's redeployment to North America will offset the tougher comps from the lapping of Norwegian Bliss's inaugural season as well as the impact from six scheduled dry docks for the high yielding Oceana and region brands. As for the cadence of a net crews cost excluding field per capacity day, the third quarter is expected to be the highest growth quarter, mainly due to the timing of dry docks, with one scheduled dry dock for an Oceana vessel occurring at the tail end of the quarter compared to zero dry docks in the prior year. Q2 is expected to be the second highest quarter primarily due to the dry dock and repositioning on Norwegian Joy. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter, which can be found on Slide 13. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 2.5% or 2% on an as reported basis. This growth comes despite headwinds from the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter which includes premium price sailings for the spring break period as well as Norwegian Joy's final China sailings. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity Norwegian Bliss, which is garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average while sailing in the Caribbean, net yield growth is expected to be approximately 2%. This comes on top of 4% growth in the prior year. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 2.5% or 2% on an as reported basis. As for fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $456, with expected consumption of approximately 215,000 metric tons. Looking below the line, we expect a $0.10 one-time benefit from tax planning initiatives as discussed on our previous call, which has shifted from Q4 to Q1 and it's expected to be partially offset by a $0.04 exchange loss, resulting in a net benefit of approximately $0.06. Taking all of this into account adjusted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $0.70, a 17% increase over the prior year. As Frank mentioned earlier, in 2018, we made significant progress towards achieving our full speed ahead 2020 targets that we provided at our Investor Day. As you can see on Slide 14, we've reported better than expected adjusted EPS growth of 24% increased our double digit adjusted ROIC to 11%, delivered our balance sheet to 3.3 times and returned 400 million for approximately one-third of our targeted 1 to 1.5 billion of capital to shareholders. Looking at slide 15, our cash generation continues to accelerate and we remain extremely focused on returning meaningful capital to our shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a total of approximately $665 million worth of shares under our previous and current repurchase authorizations. We have a $600 million remaining on our current 1 billion, three-year authorization. Our goal is to have a balanced approach to our capital allocation strategy, while maintaining maximum flexibility. We continue to explore with our board, the potential initiation of a dividend. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Well, my earlier commentary focused on our 2019 story. I want to reinforce that we are focused just as much on the long-term and on our sustainable success as we continue to make sizable investments to drive future returns even higher. We continue to invest in the growth and quality of our fleet with recently announced new ship orders for the Oceana and region brands, which number one, expands our new bill program to 11 ships featuring approximately 28,000 berths for delivery over the next nine years to 2027, a 50% increase from current capacity level. Number two, these new orders give us new state-of-the-art tonnage for our three best-in-class brands and number three provide us with measured capacity growth for years to come all financed at historically low interest rates. We also continue to invest in our existing fleets of the Oceana next initiative I mentioned in my earlier commentary and Norwegian Edge, which saw the penultimate ship in a program Norwegian Sky undergoing comprehensive refurbishment that has left the ship in as good as new condition, elevating our offering in a three-and four-day Bahamas in Cuba market. We continue investing in Port-related and destination specific infrastructure with a new dedicated state-of-the-art terminal at Port Miami under construction a partnership to develop the strategically important IT straight point port in Alaska and the completion of exciting new guests facing developments at great state of K or Bahamas private island. And last but not least, we continue investing in technology with Cruise Freedom, our innovative technology platform that leverages the very latest proximity and location technologies including wearables. Cruise Freedom will meaningfully enhance the guest experience and will be ready to make her debut on Norwegian Encore late in 2019. We'll have more news on that as we get closer to Encore's launch. Today, we've covered a lot of ground. So we provided some key takeaways which you can find on slide 16. Looking back, we delivered a breakout year in 2018 with record-setting financial results driven by strong demand and the exceptional performance of Norwegian Bliss. Looking to the intermediate term, we look to build on our strong book position and deliver another record-breaking year in 2019. And last but not least, we are ahead of pace to deliver on our full speed ahead 2020 targets. On behalf of our 33,000 employees I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders whether you are a shareholder, a creditor, a travel agent partner, a vendor, or our valued guest for continued confidence and trust and support. And with that I'll open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Your line is now open. Harry Curtis : Good morning everyone, very strong results. I had a couple of questions. Frank, if you could discuss given your record booking level, the strategy going forward balancing the need to continue filling your fleet this year and next versus pushing price, because you are so well ahead, is it not likely that just the math behind being ahead you had less cadence to sell. So what is the balance we should look forward to between pushing price versus occupancy? Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Harry. So the load is in very, very good shape both for 2019 and 2020 as we stated in our commentary. So we're focusing on price. We're pushing price higher everywhere we can both in 2019 and 2020. You saw the booking curve elongate 9% year-over-year, and I always say that I'm not sure what the optimal booking curve is, but any time I can push the booking curve out, and raise price at the same time that's good for our business. So I think overall, while we still had a lot of cabins to fill the emphasis will be on raising prices across all three brands. Harry Curtis : Very good. And then the follow-up question is 2019 is another sizeable renovation year for your legacy fleet and as you exit 2019 if you could describe the competitiveness of the legacy fleet vis-\u00e0-vis its need for any significant additional renovation spend beyond 2019? Frank Del Rio : Yes, well, dry docks are a continual phenomenon in our industry required by our class, but I will tell you that the heavy lifting as I mentioned several times in prior calls will be behind us at the end of '20. The entire Regent fleet has now been completely refurbished. The OceaniaNEXT program has one vessel behind us that was done at the tail end of '18, two more in '19, and the last one will be in '20. We just finished Norwegian Sky. I just walked through the day after she came out of dry dock she literally is as good as new. And the last one we're going to focus on is Norwegian Spirit. And I don't think it's any coincidence that our record industry leading yields are as a result of how well we maintain our vessels. And that's something that is core to our strategy of offering consumers the very best product possible and we can see that consumers are willing to pay for it. Harry Curtis : So the bottom line is that your free cash flow in 2020 should look pretty measurably then? Frank Del Rio : It will because of our performance, our increased yields. It will because we'll have more capacity. 2020 will be a very sizable year in capacity. We have two new vessels, each of them operating roughly 11 months each. And one of them is what I suspect will be the highest yielding ship in our fleet, the new Regent Splendor. So yes, free cash flow is something that we expect to accelerate. It's part of our 2020 target of returning up to $1.5 billion to our shareholders one way or the other. And as we mentioned during our prepared comments, we're well on track to achieve that. Harry Curtis : That's great, everyone, thanks very much. Frank Del Rio : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is now open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, good morning. Your very detailed prepared remarks blew through like almost all my questions. Frank Del Rio : Did we miss one? Felicia Hendrix : Sorry? Frank Del Rio : Did we miss one? Felicia Hendrix : You missed a few. Frank Del Rio : Oh. Felicia Hendrix : So the first thing I wanted to talk about was your first quarter net yield guidance. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the things that changed clearly for the better regarding your outlook there since you last reported, because if we kind of dial back to then. And if you look at where consensus was and it's been -- came down kind of into the call. The perception was that your first quarter guidance was going to be a bit more muted than what you gave. So just kind of wondering, I mean, I think Frank, you're very clear to say that pricing has been getting better and stronger, but if you could just kind of walk us through what happened from then until now to give us some color about the strength in the markets, help us understand that, that would be great. Mark Kempa : Yes. Felicia, this is Mark, I think it's just a result of what we've been seeing in the overall industry. We're seeing strong pricing in all of our markets. Caribbean is doing fantastic. We're guiding 2.5% for the first quarter and about a half a point of that is related to the Bliss and she's operating in the Caribbean, but when you strip out the new capacity the underlying organic fleet is strong. And that's coming across all markets. So we're just seeing good business everywhere we operate. Felicia Hendrix : But I guess my point is that it seems to have been getting stronger even in a short period of time, no? Because I mean, if we go back to when you reported again -- I think the view was that the number wasn't thought to be as high as what you actually came in with your guidance. Mark Kempa : Yes, we're seeing strong pricing on our remaining inventory and we're seeing significantly strong trends in our onboard revenue as well. So that's helping profit up. So when you put that together it's creating a nice, healthy momentum for us. Felicia Hendrix : Great. And then just on Alaska, I mean, Frank, I think that you made a lot of really good points there. But you know the investment community is concerned about the capacity increases we're seeing in Alaska this year which has to do with Joy and I'm just wondering like -- obviously, you guys are going to do well there with the new hardware there, but do you think that Joy and Bliss will have created a halo effect over the entire region, like, lift Alaska in general in terms of the consumer and demand or do you think your ships might be cannibalizing other supply that's there? Frank Del Rio : It's hard to say, Felicia, certainly, the -- you know, two years in a row of us being able to deploy top hardware to the region has created excitement in the region, even more excitement for our own brand. Even our third vessel in the Alaska region, Norwegian Jewel -- obviously Joy and Bliss overshadow is doing better than ever. It's been two years in a row now of double-digit growth in capacity. Not just for us, but for the industry. But I think it goes to show the strength of Alaska. It's a short season. People know that they only have a small window to be able to go and people are going. Alaska has become a go-to, must-have destination on your bucket list especially for families. And our ships certainly are built for families. There's everything you can possibly think of to do on these vessels. I think millennials love the outdoors and the environmentally oriented destination of Alaska. So I think it's got a lot going for it, and -- but I do hope that next year, in 2020, and I think it is -- we'll have much more moderate capacity growth in that region. Felicia Hendrix : Great. Thank you so much. Frank Del Rio : Thank you. Mark Kempa : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So Frank, I was pretty surprised to hear your comments on the Bliss and just your ability to hold it in some cases, raised price from a year ago. So I guess of your 3% to 4% yield guide for the year. How much of a tailwind have you baked in from Bliss, if you baked in a tailwind at all and then, can you also parse out how much of a tailwind you've baked in from the Joy redeployment? Mark Kempa : Yes, hi, Jared. This is Mark. So, we guided 3% to 4% and when we -- first let's address the Bliss; Bliss is doing fantastic in many as we said in many months she's booking at or above what she garnered in her inaugural year, which there's not a lot of cases where you can say that. That said, she is also analyzing year-over-year. So you have some tailwind that knocks that down, so Bliss is really essentially a plus shore slight tailwind for the year. As far as the Joy, I think the best way to think about it is, we had said with this whole itinerary redeployment it was going to be a $0.30 accretion in 2020, if you kind of parse that back and you look at that and say that's a clean annualized number. And you pull out the dry-dock costs, which are, I guess, around $0.03 to $0.04. And then you say she is operating about only two-thirds of the year in '19. That gets you to about most, let's say, $0.17 or $0.18 of accretion. And as we said with the redeployment, it's all on revenue; it's all ticket to an onboard revenue accretion. So when you compare that against our -- what is it, a point of yield it's approximately $0.23. You get to about 75 basis points of yield tailwind for the quarter for the year and then with the lower capacity days we are being out of service, it gets you in around the 1% zone. So our underlying organic fleet growth is really growing at our 2% to 3% in line with our expectations of what we target every year. Jared Shojaian : That's really helpful. Thank you. And I know it's a little early to be talking about 2019 or 2020, but I'm going to ask you about anyways, just given some of your comments. And, it seems to be shaping up well, and on the yield side, you've got several tailwinds with Splendor and Encore and analyzing Joy. And then on the cost side, you have tailwinds from lapping the drydock and the marketing spend, et cetera. So is it unreasonable to assume that 2020 yields and costs could look better than a normal year just assuming kind of a steady macro environment from here? Mark Kempa : Yes, assuming a steady macro environment that's always the necessary requirement with Splendor coming on certainly she's going to bring premium yields to our corporate average. But that's going to be somewhat offset by Encore again, so on core as we said Bliss is doing well in the Caribbean Encore is our best book ship, new bill launch in the Caribbean. But you have to look at her on an annual basis, so at this stage looking forward, it's a bit early. We don't necessarily believe that Encore may be accretive to our system yields, but it is, it's looking great but it's just still way too early to make that commitment. And then, in terms of the cost, yes, I think we will see some deceleration on the cost front from '19 to '20 given some of the one time or ramp up in cost that we've seen this year. Jared Shojaian : Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Hey good morning. One of your peers talked about a little bit of weakness from Europe source customers, just given the macro uncertainly there are you seeing that at all? Frank Del Rio : Yes, U.K. has been little up and down. But unlike our peers, where we don't have national brands that require, a whole lot of locally sourced business to make things work. Our percentage of business that comes from Europe is a little bit less than half of our total internationally source business. So can Europe be doing a little better? Yes, probably could. But again, our domestic demand is so strong for Europe just for Europe itineraries that we're not relying a whole lot on Europe source business to sell our vessels. We are more focused on raising prices in Europe and over the last two years, we now have two consecutive years, so we've been able to raise prices for Europe source business over 20% as we hone in on our best cash strategy with only 26 ships, the demand that we are seeing for our products we can be selective and what customer's resource and quite frankly we're going for price. And so as I said before we raise prices to the point where there's parity for us the source market we are in different whether a Brit or a German or on American a book our cruises because we price it accordingly. And so I think that's one of the private key differences for us and some of our peers that we simply don't have to rely on the European market as much as others may have to. Thomas Allen : Thanks, helpful. Thanks. And last quarter, as far as focus on free air promotion and -- any updates on how that progressing? Mark Kempa : Hi, I'll take that one. We've been very happy with how we free airs has been received. It's in the very hard our focusing on the value over the prize and we see it as one more tool in the toolbox and so we're able to use it where it makes sense then that tends to be in some of our further out inventory longer hold product. It's definitely a program not a promotion, it's something that we can use that at times where it makes sense to add value, keep the story well away from pricing and along with the beverage package, the dining package, Wi-Fi, shore excursion and an opportunity to add value move away from price and continue to have this really strong pricing deployment that we've been we've been demonstrating this. So if you like it you'll continue to see it and we'll place strategically make sense for this. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is now open. Steven Wieczynski : Good morning. So Mark, you talked on -- but I guess, around the Norwegian fleet enhancements you guys talk about that you think that would drive about $0.30 in additional earnings in 2020 and I was wondering if you could help us think about where that estimate currently fits. Is that still a pretty good range I guess what I'm getting at it seems like there could be some outside that range now given how strong the demand and pricing patterns that are currently out of the marketplace? Mark Kempa : Yes, $0.30 that was our best guess we always try to give you our most educated forecast and I think it's you know it it's really early, that we are seeing great signs, great booking patterns on the Joy and the other redeployment that we initiated but it's still early I think we're confident that in that number but to say that we're exceed at this point I think is a bit premature. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, got you. And then second question would be around fuel consumption I guess, if we look at the first corner consumption of 215 tons and then compare to the full-year estimate of 860. Assume pretty big step up in consumption in the last couple quarters just wondering what you know might be driving that and then also maybe how we should think about consumption in 2020 as well if there's anything that we should be thinking about around consumption over the next 12 or 24 months. Thanks. Mark Kempa : I think in the first quarter a big portion of that is going to be Bliss as she repositions tour dry dock in and comes out of Asia. I'm sorry Joy I apologize I said Bliss. And that as we look forward our consumption if we normalize our consumption per capacity day for 19 if we took out the Joy repositioning, we took out the encore which is again being delivered later in the year who have to come across the Atlantic, we would expect our consumption to be down you know some words 0% to 1% which is consistent with what we aim to deliver. And then in 2020, I think we would see an escalation in that you know prop possibly in the 2% to 3% zone as we analyze the larger ships and the -- comes on board as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Brandt Montour : Good morning everyone, appreciate you taking the questions. So I know the way away on China I just want to ask about the reaching spirits plans to deploy the next year is that still the plan and how is your thinking regarding a lot I believe that market changed the if it all sense, so technician was enough last July. Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yes, Brandt, it will be year round trip to Asia. We're always looking to deployed vessels at the highest yielding itinerary as you know you heard me say many times itineraries is the number one driver of yield. So will continue evaluating and but yes Spirit will go to Asia and I think in second part of your question is have we seen anything different in the Chinese market. I would now ply with that Joy has performed a line slightly ahead of what we had expected in the first quarter of 2019 but never the last. Her deployment to Alaska for all the regions you heard so far today in a prepared statement was the right thing to do. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks. And just following up, just a little housekeeping on CapEx and I apologize if you already touched on this but CapEx guidance came up a little bit for this year and next year as wanted get a sense how much of that is the new port you announced in Alaska and what else maybe in there. Mark Kempa : Yes, so that our agreement with the port and the infrastructure in Alaska, that's an asset light agreement so it's not really a lot of CapEx is coming on that very similar to our ported Miami agreement. The increase is really driven around the additional ships that we recently announced as you recall we announced two new builds for Oceania and one additional for Regent cruises and in addition to our Leo five and six class. So that in conjunction with some further investments that we planned to make around technology and other infrastructure. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of David Beckel with Bernstein. Your line is now open. David Beckel : I had a quick question about onboard spending in the beat in Q4, can you this provide a little bit more color on exactly where I know you mentioned across all components but are there specific initiatives you put in place that are driving stronger than expected on borders or is more function of just robust consumer environment and just to follow up on that for 2019, what do you sort of expecting in terms of onboard spending growth on a year-over-year basis? Mark Kempa : Yes, so I for quarter fourth quarter we saw great trends across all of our streams. So I think the key is and we've been saying this is we've been investing in and getting the consumer touch point earlier in the booking cycle. So we're selling more ahead, we're bundling more ahead. So what happened is the consumer is coming on board with a clean wallet, a fresh wallet. So that helps us. We're seeing strength in our casino channels it's just really across every channel. As pivot to 2019, we typically look for you know 1% or 2% of growth in on board revenue. Obviously, we always try to outperform that's our typical modeling range and the early signs of what we're seeing in the quarter for January, February are looking good. We're seeing continued strong trends there, so very positive. David Beckel : Great. If I could just add a quick follow up there, can you remind us about what percentage of your, I guess is mostly plus Norwegian passengers are packaging or what percentage of onboard spend is prepackage verses actually on board the ship? Mark Kempa : Yes, I don't know that we've given specific details on that but I think were probably north of half of our guests are in this part or in the bundle packaging deal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Vince Ciepiel : Good morning. I wanted to circle back to fuel expenses, at the Investor Day you mentioned the potential that MGO could step up to 60% of the mix is that still the thinking going into next year and then it looks like your hedged position increased from 3Q release or the 4Q release, and now 50% hedge for 2020, which is ahead of schedule. I think you normally target to be 50% in the current year, so how are you thinking about fuel costs going into 2020, would that change, could you elaborate a little bit on that? Mark Kempa : Yes, certainly. So everything we see for 2020 we are still targeting that, you know, roughly 60% MGL mix. We have a significant investment in our scrubber technology. And all the ships that are coming online are coming online as planned within our date range. So that's positive. In terms of hedging, what you guys have seen it. Since our last call in November at one point fuel markets were down almost what 17% or so, so we took advantage and we layered on more hedging for both '19 and '20. And more particularly, we layered it on in our gas oil which is our proxy 4MGL. So we were able to obtain some favorable pricing. And in terms of our strategy, we aim to be at a minimum 50% hedge going into the year, but we have always said that when there're dips in the market, we'll opportunistically ramp that up and that's what you saw over the course of Q4. Vince Ciepiel : Great, thanks. And then just separately on the Caribbean, could you touch on what you are seeing on a regional basis? I know that throughout 2018 it sounds like the western was improving and maybe coming in at a bit of a premium to the east. I am just curious what you are seeing as demand has recovered for eastern Caribbean sailing and what pricing looks like there, and just your thoughts on Caribbean pricing as a whole for 2019 versus '18? Andy Stuart : Yes, it's Andy. I'll take that. Overall, we are very happy with Caribbean. As Frank said in his opening comments, we have seen the acceleration overall. Pricing is up in the Caribbean, load factor is up in the Caribbean. We are seeing it broadly across the region. And Bliss, of course, has been an outstanding deployment in the Caribbean as well as in Alaska trade. And so in the east, she has performed extremely well. So we really don't see any hangover in the Caribbean at all. We just see acceleration and performance. Strong pricing, strong load, and feel very good about the outlook. Frank Del Rio : Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Tim Conder : Thank you, and congrats to the whole team on the conclusion of the year, I wanted to circle, Frank, on the Med and in particularly the eastern Med and with the Splendor coming and maybe shifting around a little bit of capacity, that historically has been a very high yielding segment for the industry. What are you seeing there with demand? I know some itinerates have been slowly added back for your sales in the industry. But what are you see and how do you see that looking on out in the '21 and so forth at this point assuming no changes in geopolitical obviously? Frank Del Rio : Yes. I am ready for that question, Tim. We for the first time since 2016, we went back to the Med -- to the eastern Med, this coming summer with 12 sailings increasing to 20 sailing in 2020. And I am pleased to tell you that all 12 sailings in 2019 are better loaded and at higher pricing than the surrounding sailing that do not include Turkey. Turkey is the -- when we talk about the eastern Med, Turkey is the key destination which has been somewhat off limit to the industry for the last couple of years. So the fact that the Northern American consumer who is the one booking most of these eastern Mediterranean cruises, seem to want to come back to the eastern Med and is willing to pay a premium price bodes very well for 2020. As you know, itineraries are developed and put up for sale 18-24 months sometimes before the actual sale date. So you test the waters. You see what happens. And then it takes you a while to really ramp up. So at this point assuming that there are no other disruptions or reason to not go to the eastern Med, I expect that we along with the rest of the industry will probably increase the number of deployments to the eastern Med beginning in 2020 and more in 2021. So it's good news. As you know when the eastern Med is good, it's as good as any if not the best of all itineraries. So we are all looking forward to being able to increase our presence there. Thank you, Tim. Tim Conder : Okay. Then a quick follow-up here for me, Mark, just a little bit more detail, if you would, can you enumerate what the tech investments are in the CapEx and then when you anticipate having all those tech enhancements rolled to the fleet? Mark Kempa : Yes. I think it's a bit early to say what we are investing in. I think we are looking at all different aspects. As we said, we are looking for rolling out some new technology with the Encore later this year. And as we go forward, we want to make sure our platforms and our systems behind the scenes are capable to handle that as we look forward and maybe we start integrating voice features or artificial intelligence down the road. But we are doing some catch-up here. We are making investments slowly but surely but you are not going to see anything radically different than what we have already announced. It's more back of the house. Tim Conder : Okay, great. Thank you, gentlemen. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Tim. Frank Del Rio : And thanks everyone for time this morning and your continued support. As always, the team will be available to answer your questions later today. All the best. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I'll be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea Demarco, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. Demarco, please proceed. Andrea Demarco : Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Andy Stuart, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide updated guidance for 2019 before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make references to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2019 results was issued this morning and it's available on our investor relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Well, thank you, Andrea and good morning everyone. I'm happy to be here today to report on our first set of results for 2019 and as I'm sure you saw from this morning\u2019s earnings release, the results are very, very good. Performance in the first quarter exceeded what were already high expectations with a top line beat driven by strong pricing growth, robust close-in bookings and higher onboard spend. Combined our first quarter beat with a strong wave season that saw new bookings come in at the highest pricing ever at each of our three brand and the outcome is an increase to our full year net yield growth guidance and an increase to our full year earnings expectations. The mid point of our adjusted earnings per share guidance now stands well above the high end of our previous guidance range, an outlook that would result in our seventh consecutive year of double digit adjusted earnings per share growth, further extending our stellar track record of strong and consistent financial performance. In addition, during the quarter, we repurchased $200 million of our stock bringing our total capital returns to shareholders under our Full Speed Ahead 2020 Targets to $600 million as we continue to make progress towards achieving the shareholder return, net leverage, adjusted return on invested capital and adjusted earnings per share growth targets under the plan. As discussed in our prior call, we entered 2019 in a record book position and at higher prices. Our position of strength entering the year meant we were able to maintain our focus on driving prices and drive we did as wave season pricing came in at record level. For the balance of 2019, we are booking in similar load position to last year's record levels and at higher pricing on a comparable basis. Our load position is normalized for the significant difference in booking patterns of Norwegian Joy's charter sales model while deployed in China versus the traditional distribution and booking curve model in the west, along with certain changes in our 2019 itinerary mix, which includes a higher number of Caribbean and Bahamas cruises of less than seven days and which book closer to the sale date. Additionally, and much more importantly, the quality and stickiness of our book revenue has improved year-over-year resulting from the full effect of our earlier final payment date policy improved year-over-year booked deposit structure and a significantly higher proportion of 2019 business that includes our guest air travel booked through Norwegian's Air program. Keep in mind that year-over-year record book positions by definition cannot continue to expand indefinitely nor would we want them to. As someone who has been in this industry for over 25 years, there's always a nagging question that no matter how good your revenue management systems predict future demand or how effective your marketing campaigns push sales, perhaps some money was left on the table. And while that question can never be truly answered with absolute certainty. Fortunately in the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, if there is any money left on the table, it's on the margin as evidenced by our strong first quarter performance and increased net yield guidance for the balance of the year. Besides the momentum driven by the strength of our brands, our new hardware introductions and unique go-to-market bundling strategy, also benefiting the strong booking environment are macroeconomic factors that continue to buoy consumer confidence. As we have stated over the last few quarters, we continue to see a strong macro economic environment. One which most economists and market watchers not believe will continue for some time and the fears of a near term recession or downturn have greatly diminished, particularly in the United States as evidence by strong first quarter GDP growth and recent Fed commentary. Fears of industry oversupply have also now subsided as the industry overall and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in particular have shown their ability to successfully absorb new capacity coming online, but all of this would not be possible without a confident consumer willing to spend money on vacation travel. Consumers across the globe continue to have a strong appetite for cruise. This is especially true here in North America where we maintained an advantage, given our strong sourcing in the region and our focus on global versus national brand and our exit from the lower yielding China market. But that's not to say that we are narrowly focused on our home market. One of the advantages of operating a growing but still manageable 26-ship fleet is that we can focus on sourcing the best guests wherever they may reside. We have done this by making inroads into several sizable markets where growth is exceptionally strong, including Australia, Israel, Brazil and Mexico. Meanwhile, in more mature European markets like the UK and Germany, we have recently shifted the Norwegian brand's go-to-market offering. A year ago, we introduced Premium All Inclusive product in these markets, which has the desired effect of quickly and significantly raising prices to parity levels with those in North America. With the mission accomplished, we have now transitioned to the Free at Sea offering that has resonated so well in North America and in the rest of the world and which now provides consistency of brand messaging around the globe. Results over the first five weeks of Free at Sea in the UK and Germany is an encouraging double-digit increase in booking volume over the prior year and even more over the first quarter of this year at comparable net pricing from those two important source markets, despite the dampening influences of Brexit and other regional economic factors. And once onboard, our global consumers continue to exhibit their confidence in two ways : First, our onboard revenue performance to date has exceeded our expectation and has been outperforming last year's record level. Part of the reason is the enhanced stickiness of onboard revenue from increases in pre-booking offshore excursion and other offerings and the benefits in the Norwegian brand's Free at Sea go-to-market strategy. As an example, pre-booked onboard revenue is up solid double digits for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. With the second half of the lease of the year essentially organic and capacity growth only coming from Norwegian Encore, whose ticket yield will likely be lower than the corporate average due to our introduction into low season Caribbean itinerary, onboard revenue is expected to be a key contributor to net yield growth. Second, guests continue to book their next cruise before even finishing their current one in record numbers. Our strategy that captured guests will experience our award-winning vacation experiences has resulted in hefty record onboard cruise sales and the sale of future cruises tickets across our brand. The first quarter saw many highlights across our three brands. For the Norwegian brand, this quarter marked the first peak season of Caribbean sailings for our most successful newbuild to date, Norwegian Bliss. And just as she did in the last summer, her performance in the Caribbean this past quarter was nothing short of extraordinary. There's something about riding a golf cart on a double-decker 12-turn racetrack at 40 miles per hour under a beautiful blue Caribbean sky that makes guests want to sail on Bliss. The premium she is garnering compared to similar ships we deployed last year in the region and to other ships currently sailing similar voyages is impressive, powering the brand and the company to a very successful Caribbean season. In addition, the Norwegian brand was busy preparing Norwegian Joy for her debut in Alaska. As the vessel was virtually unknown in the North American marketplace as recently as nine months ago, the Norwegian sales and marketing teams were diligently, and may I say quickly, to increase awareness and introduce the vessels to travel partners and consumers in an abbreviated timeframe. As part of Joy's North America introduction, the team launched a successful giving Joy campaign to celebrate the intersection of travel and education and to recognize the contributions of educators in the United States and in Canada with a chance to win cruise vacation. The campaign drew 46,000 nominations from over 1.4 million votes with 30 winning educators being named from across North America. The team also took the opportunity to replicate the successful introduction of Norwegian Bliss with a slate of inaugural activities in the city \u2013 in key cities of Los Angeles, Vancouver and Seattle, introducing the vessel to nearly 5,000 travel partners and loyal past guests. I had the opportunity to visit Norwegian Joy in her first sailing to Vancouver, and I can absolutely attest that she is even a more impressive ship today than the day she was delivered new, with upgraded public spaces and other revenue-generating venues that are geared to Norwegian's broad audience. Norwegian Joy houses many of the same innovative features that make her virtually identical to her sister ship, Norwegian Bliss including a 25,000 square foot forward-facing observation lounge, perfect for indoor viewing of Alaska's world-famous vistas and the exhilarating top of the ship electric go-kart racetrack. She does, however, have several unique features that set her apart and likely makes even better than Bliss, including any five new Concierge Class staterooms that give the ship additional diversity and richness in cabin mix and offers guests an upgraded choice that sits above their traditional balcony stateroom but does not quite reach the exclusivity and luxury of the ever-popular Haven Suites. Joy also features the one-of-a-kind Galaxy Pavilion, a 100-person capacity gymnasium-sized space featuring immersive gameplay, raising simulators and a host of virtual and augmented reality experiences. The one-two punch of Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Joy is the cornerstone of our deployment the high-yielding Alaska gives the Norwegian brand by far the largest, youngest and most innovative hardware in this premium destination bar none.  In terms of performance in the region, we are extremely pleased that pricing for Norwegian Joy's Alaska voyages are easily surpassing those of Norwegian Pearl, the 2,200-passenger ship she replaced. And keep in mind two things. First, Joy is not only garnering better pricing than her predecessor but she also carries an additional 1,800 guests. Second, the onboard revenue opportunities on Norwegian Joy far eclipse those of her predecessor and is expected to drive meaningful improvement to the Norwegian brand's 2019 yield. Not to be outdone, Norwegian Bliss continues to garner historic yields in the region with certain lapping sailings continuing to price higher than her record-breaking inaugural season last year. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Alaska's deployment also leverages the investments we've made at the Port of Seattle in our development partnership at Icy Straight Point to deliver guests the best Alaska experience in the industry across our three brands. In addition, we are very proud to have been recently awarded a 10-year permit to sale Glacier Bay, Alaska cruising's most popular destination in both the peak and shoulder seasons through 2029. These permits are granted only once every decade by the U.S. National Park Service based on a very competitive and rigorous set of criteria. With Alaska now representing 9% of our annual capacity and with its expected continued growth as a key deployment region, our strategic investments to develop new destinations and ability to maintain access to premium attractions sets the foundation for further growth in this high-yielding region. Meanwhile, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises continue their stellar booking performance with both brands having little inventory to sell in 2019. The strong booking momentum is vividly on display as both brands are now approximately 40% sold for 2020, achieving this milestone record load factor earlier than ever before and at higher pricing. Oceania continues to rollout fleet and product enhancements under its Oceania NEXT program. Insignia underwent their first enhancements under the program in a comprehensive dry dock late last year and the feedback from guests and traveled partner has been extraordinary. And in keeping with its brand promise of offering the finest cuisine at sea, Oceania recently rolled out an expansive and diverse new selection of plant-based cuisine that reflects our guests evolving pallets and heightened focus on wellness. These enhancements continue to strengthen the Oceania\u2019s brand industry-leading position as having the finest cuisine at sea, a definitive, competitive advantage. Our guests repeat rate of over 50% is as high as it's ever been and just last month the release of the brand's 2021 winter season deployment resulted in a single largest booking day in the brand\u2019s 16-year history. As for Regent the construction of Seven Seas Splendor is well underway and we are eagerly awaiting the January 2020 arrival of the ship that embodies luxury perfected. Splendor will not only make history as the newest standard for luxury cruising when she debuts, but she will also be the first ship in the cruise industry to launch with a female captain at the helm. Captain Serena Melani joined Regent in 2010 serving in several roles before becoming the brand\u2019s first female Master Captain in 2016. We are extremely proud to have Captain Melani leading the dedicated group of Seven Seas Splendor during her inaugural season. And demonstrating the strength of the Regent brand's popularity among wealthy consumers, the growth in the total value of its bookings for 2020 sailings is significantly outpacing the brand's capacity increase of 26% stemming from the addition of Splendor to the fleet and at higher prices. This is one of the reasons that advanced ticket sales for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings were 18% higher at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the first quarter 2018, despite a sub-3% increase in capacity for the company in 2019. This indeed has been a stellar quarter for the company, so I therefore like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our outperformance in the quarter and our improved guidance for the remainder of the year. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Unless and otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our first quarter results, followed by color on booking trends and close with our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019. Throughout my commentary, I will be referring to the slide presentation, which Andrea mentioned earlier in the call. I am pleased to report yet another record quarter, one where the company generated the highest first quarter revenue and earnings in its history. Adjusted EPS grew 38% over prior year to $0.83 and exceeded our prior guidance by $0.13. As you can see on Slide 4, the beat was driven by : $0.06 of revenue outperformance from exceptionally strong onboard revenue and strong, well-priced close-in bookings; a $0.04 one-time incremental net tax benefit in connection with certain tax restructuring strategies, which was recorded as a $0.07 benefit below the line, partially offset by the other tax related expenses of $0.03 in net cruise cost, ex fuel. It should be noted that this net tax benefit is incremental to the $0.10 that was already included in our February earnings guidance. Lastly, a $0.03 benefit from foreign exchange and other below the line items including a partial benefit from our share repurchase in the quarter. Turning to Slide 5, net yield increased 4.1% or 3.2% on an as-reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations by 160 basis points. The beat was driven by exceptionally strong onboard revenue across all major streams and better than expected pricing on close-in bookings. Excluding the benefit from new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which garnered yields above the corporate average in the quarter, first quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 3.1%. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel, increased 3.6% versus prior year and 3% on an as-reported basis. When comparing to guidance, costs were higher primarily due to the previously mentioned tax-related expenses of $0.03. Total fuel expense was in line with expectations as fuel consumption savings offset an increase in fuel price per metric ton net of hedges which came in at $461. Now let's discuss capacity and deployment for the second quarter. Our capacity is expected to increase approximately 2% primarily due to the addition of Norwegian Bliss to the fleet. I will direct you to Slide 6 to review deployment highlights. In the second quarter, our Caribbean mix is approximately 26% slightly higher than prior year due to Norwegian Bliss. Our deployment mix in Europe represents approximately 27%, a slight increase to prior year due to the addition of Norwegian Pearl sailing out of Amsterdam. With the repositioning of Norwegian Joy to Alaska mix in that region increases to approximately 13% and conversely the APAC mix decreases to 3%. Our expectations for the second quarter can be found on Slide 7. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% or 5% on an as-reported basis, primarily driven by strong performance from our core fleet. The benefit from Norwegian Joy\u2019s redeployment to North America accounts for approximately 200 basis points of growth in the quarter. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which is dilutive to the corporate average yield while sailing in the Mexican Riviera, net yield is expected to be approximately 6.5%. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 5.25% or 4.5% on an as-reported basis, primarily due to direct costs from the dry dock repositioning and integrally events of Norwegian Joy, as well as the approximately 50 days Joy was out of service, which results in fewer capacity days to allocate operating expenses over, thereby increasing our unit cost basis. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges to be $485 with expect to consumption of approximately 207,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be approximately a $1.33 or a 10% increase over prior year. Looking at expectations for the full year on Slide 8, net yields for the year is expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% or 3% to 4% on an as-reported basis, which represents a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint versus our prior guidance issued in February. Excluding incremental capacity for Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore results in only a marginal difference to our annual net yield guidance. As a reminder, Norwegian Bliss\u2019 Caribbean sailings in Q1 garnered yields above the corporate average and are expected to be offset by below corporate average yields when sailing in the Mexican Riviera. Concurrently, Encore\u2019s one month of revenue service does little to move the needle on a full year basis. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 3.5% or 3% on an as-reported basis. The 25 basis point increase versus prior guidance is due to the previously mentioned tax related expenses. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $490 with expect to consumption of approximately 845,000 metric tons. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.50, which is above the high end of our previous range and would result in an 11% increase versus prior year at the mid-point. Excluding a $0.10 impact from unfavorable fuel prices and foreign exchange rates, our guidance would have been in the range of $5.50 cents to $5.60 or a 13% increase over prior year. On Slide 9, I'll walk you through the components of the $0.20 raise to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. $0.14 of incremental net yield growth is made up of top line outperformance in the first quarter of $0.06, combined with a stronger outlook for the remainder of the year of $0.08, a benefit from fuel consumption savings and other below-the-line $0.05, $0.07 of accretion from share repurchases executed in the quarter, the previously mentioned one time incremental net tax benefit of $0.04, all of which are part partially offset by headwinds from higher fuel prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $0.10. Our updated outlook represents double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the prior year, which would continue our track record of delivering double-digit annual adjusted EPS growth to seven consecutive years. As a reminder, this guidance excludes onetime expenses of approximately $25 million for enhancements to Norwegian Joy associated with her redeployments in North America. Looking at fuel and the upcoming change in regulations, we continue to refine our fuel strategy to manage a changing landscape and minimize volatility. In Q1, we sold the remainder of our Brent hedge positions for a gain and replaced them with gas oil hedges, which we believe gives us better correlation to the fuel we consume. In addition, we entered into costless collars for approximately 14% of our remaining MGO consumption to further reduce volatility for the remainder of 2019. The collars protect us from the risk of rising prices while at the same time allows us to benefit from potential price declines. Slide 10 provides a summary of our hedging program and our strategy in relation to the IMO 2020 regulations a strategy that combines the utilization of closed loops, exhaust gas cleaning systems and increased consumption of marine gas oil or other compliant fuel blends. We also minimize volatility around the interest rate environment with the addition of a three-year, $230 million interest rate swap, which increases our fixed debt ratio to approximately 75%. For the remainder of the year there were a few housekeeping items to keep in mind around the cadence of growth and net yield and net cruise cost excluding fuel. Net yield growth for the third and fourth quarters, are expected to be similar. And for net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day, we expect growth in the third quarter to be similar of that in the second quarter.  Our progress towards achieving our full speed ahead 2020 targets continues on an upward trajectory. As you can see on Slide 11, in March, we repurchased $200 million in shares which increased the cumulative amount of shareholder returns to $600 million in connection with our target of $1 billion to $1.5 billion by the end of 2020. As previously mentioned, our goal is to have a balanced approach to capital allocation strategy while maintaining maximum flexibility. Any further capital returns for the remainder of the year would likely be skewed the latter part of the year and we continue to explore with our Board the possible initiation of a dividend. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary. Frank Del Rio : Thanks, Mark. As we wrap up the call, there are a couple of subject matters I would like to highlight. First, is a topic which I'm sure is on the mind of anyone that follows the industry and that is Cuba. Current regulations continue to allow for people-to-people travel and we continue to follow and comply with any and all directors from the various agencies of the federal government. We expect more clarity sometime in the future regarding travel to Cuba, but in the meantime we will continue to offer cruises to the island as plan. The second topic is our commitment to the environment, which is highlighted on Slide 12. One of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings\u2019 core value is environmental stewardship. And on Earth Day of this year, we released our third annual Stewardship Report, which details our progress and sustainability goals and impactful initiatives underway. These include the elimination of plastic straws across our 26 ship fleet and our two island destinations in the Bahamas and Belize, our industry first partnership with the Ocean Conservancy's Trash Free Seas Alliance, and our Hope Starts Here All Hands and Hearts campaign, to rebuild schools and infrastructure on Caribbean islands impacted by 2017 record hurricane season. Most recently, Ocean and Regent announced their commitment to eliminate it combined five million plastic water bottles a year through a new partnership with Vero Water. I encourage everyone to view our online report which details many more of the actions we are undertaking to conserve resources and to protect our environment. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I like to leave you with a few key takeaways on Slide 13. We delivered another record-breaking quarter with first quarter results outperforming expectations. The solid demand environment and wave season drove an increase in our outlook for net yields and adjusted earnings per share, which is now above our previous guidance range. And we are well positioned to deliver on our full speed ahead 2020 targets and continue to return capital to shareholders. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions and answers. Andrew? Operator : Thank you Mr. Del Rio. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask you the 4.1% yield growth in the first quarter. I mean that's obviously a pretty impressive result. And last call you were saying first quarter would be the lowest growth quarter, partly because you don't have the mix benefits from Joy until the second quarter. And as I look at your revised guidance, you're only assuming about 3% yield growth in the second half, which is about a point below what you did in the first quarter. So can you talk about why that dynamic changed with the first quarter, which was supposed to be the lowest rate quarter and now looking like the back half is a little bit lower and should we interpret that the back half potentially having some conservatism baked in for whatever reason, whether that's Cuba or something else. Thank you. Mark Kempa : Thanks Jared. Hi, this is Mark. So first quarter, look, we had a stellar quarter. We had exceptionally strong performance from our onboard revenue streams on all ships. Bliss continued to knock it out of the park in Q1. So we just had a great quarter and it came from all geographical areas, which is very encouraging. In relation to the second half, I think you had mentioned that our implied guidance is roughly 3%. I think our implied guidance on a constant basis is about 3.5%. And look, nothing has changed since our last call. Our core fundamentals have not changed and they continue to be strong. Q2 is coming in much better than we anticipated. And as we rolled back into the back half of the year, look, we know there's always variability around onboard revenue. So it\u2019s continued to be strong quarter after quarter. We expect it to continue to be strong, but we've taken a measured approach. We have years of data which says where we should expect it to come through, but we've taken a bit of a measured approach here and I don't want to bank on that for the back half of the year. So that could be potential upside. But more importantly, the core fundamentals for the back half of the year have not changed. Jared Shojaian : Great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. Hey, can you help us think about the yield premium on your itineraries that have a stop at Cuba, and is it full flow through or is Cuba also a higher cost market for you? Thank you. Frank Del Rio : It's not a higher cost market. We've always said that the pent up demand and the relatively tight supply of birth capacity in Havana both drive higher prices. And so we are hopeful that the administration finds a way to keep the cruise industry being able to sail to Cuba. Jared Shojaian : Okay. And care to talk about the yield premium at all? Frank Del Rio : We've said it's substantial and it was substantial on day one and it's continued, but we're not going to give you destination by destination, pricing guidance more than we already do. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Instinet. Your line is now open. Harry Curtis : Good morning everyone. So Frank, in the press release you guys referenced the revitalization of Sky. How many more ships are still yet to be renovated and once that's completed, does it \u2013 what do you do with the incremental free cash that lower CapEx might imply? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Yes, Harry, so through 2019, we have a couple of more ship revitalization programs. At the end of last year, we launched the Oceania NEXT program. So at the end of this year, three of those four vessels will be done. So looking ahead 2020, we really only have one major ship to undergo the knife, so to speak. And that's Norwegian Spirit which will be deployed out to the Far East.  So yes, it brings up an interesting question. We've been investing quite heavily on our fleet, revitalizing all three brands and I think today those fleets are in the best condition they've ever been. We continued to invest in other land-related initiatives, whether it's in our islands, the terminal, in Miami, what I mentioned in my prepared comments about Alaska, but clearly given our yield guidance, our earnings per share, growth guidance and more tempered non-new ship CapEx going forward, you'd expect the company to have more free cash flow available for distribution to shareholders. And as Mark mentioned a minute ago, we've already paid out roughly a $1 billion to shareholders in the last four or five quarters and hopefully that will continue. And as Mark also mentioned, we're continuing to look and assess the timing and the amount of a dividend. Harry Curtis : So, thank you, and the follow-up to that is, when you think about the incremental investment that you're making on land-based facilities, what's the return on that? Does it enhance your ROIC? Does it get you at or above the 12% target that you have? Frank Del Rio : Yes, I don't think we would do it, if we didn't think it was accretive. The industry is a competitive one. And we're seeing, for example in Alaska where we now have 9% of our capacity, it's the highest-yielding destination we have. We think we have a competitive footprint there. And we need to continue to invest to make sure that we keep that competitive advantage. And being able to secure those Glacier Bay permits for the next 10 years is really a feather in our cap. Those were highly sought after and our ability to maintain what we had and actually increased some, certainly fees into out premise at Alaska is going to a future growth destination for us. Mark Kempa : And Harry, we've been very, very vocal. When we invested in Harvest Caye over the last few years. We've said that our Western Caribbean itineraries are garnering a premium versus what they used to get. So I think as we continue to invest in various land-based strategic investments, I think it's going to be complementary to our targets. Andy Stuart : Yes, I\u2019ll just add to that, Harry, when we added Harvest Caye to the Western Caribbean that was the first time the Western Caribbean achieved the premium over the Eastern Caribbean. So it really made a substantial measurable difference to the performance of the Western Caribbean itinerary. Harry Curtis : Well, thank you. These are terrific results. Frank Del Rio : Thank you. Mark Kempa : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is now open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, thank you, and good morning. So Mark, you gave us some really good color in your prepared remarks to understand your organic fleet growth versus kind of like how things are growing driven by your new hardware versus your organic fleet growth. But what I'm wondering is, can we peel the layers back a little bit farther, just looking at the organic Norwegian fleet, are you seeing similar upside to ticket pricing and onboard as your overall guidance in commentary would imply? Or is it just being driven by stronger pricing on organic Oceania and Regent? Mark Kempa : No, so I'll peel back the onion on the yield side in a sec. But I want to make it very clear, we are seeing strong pricing in both our ticket and onboard pricing and it's across all three brands and it's across all geographies. So there's not one brand that's buoying another, I want to be very clear about that. In terms of our organic core fleet, I think that the best example in showing its strength is Q2. So we're guiding to 5.5% yield growth and Bliss is dilutive in the quarter, so \u2013 by about 100 basis points. So that would imply that we're growing at 6.5%. Of that 6.5% Joy redeployment to North America is contributing about 200 basis points. So that's telling you our core fleet is doing 4.5% in the quarter. So that's very strong, we're very happy with that. And we continue to see that strength throughout the year. The fundamentals are have not changed and we're seeing it across the board. Felicia Hendrix : That's great. And then just with the onboard, so you're seeing the strength in ticket pricing coming from demand and then you're obviously seeing kind of more stickiness and demand on the onboard side. Now that the app is up on 16 ships. I'm just wondering, maybe beyond the next few quarters, how we should think about the onboard revenue trajectory. Can that be incremental to what you're already seeing? Mark Kempa : Yes, so I'll start with the trajectory part. As I've said before, we typically model somewhere in the zone of 1% to 2% of onboard revenue growth. And as we see more of the onboard revenue getting presold prior to the consumers stepping onboard, we get a little bit more visibility on that and again, we are able to focus on more very fresh wallet concept. But again, we like to take a measured approach on that. And in terms of the app, I'll flip that over to Andy for some commentary. Andy Stuart : Yes, as you said, Felicia, we've got the app across the fleet now. We've been very, very happy with it. It really seamlessly connects the pre-cruise experience with the onboard experience, putting tremendous energy into presales for dining, entertainment, shore excursions and having a lot of success with that. And now in everybody's hands, we've got an app that allows them to continue with that process right up to the sailing and then onboard the ship, buy all of those things through the app. We've seen a 20% increase in usage of the app since we launched the new app versus iConcierge as we've seen a 26% increase in the take up of packages related to chat and voice over IP on the ship. And the app\u2019s got a 4.7 rating in the App Store. So guests like it, they're using it, it's effective driving revenue, we're very happy with it. Felicia Hendrix : Great, thank you for that color. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is now open. Steven Wieczynski : Hey guys, good morning. Mark, just probably be for you but when you announced those fleet deployment changes, almost a year ago at this point you guys indicated you expected to earn kind of a $0.30 uplift in 2020. Given what you've now seen from some of these changes and it still might be a little bit too early. I guess what I'm asking here is, do you think that $0.30 estimate might be conservative now? Mark Kempa : Yes, I think you hit it on the nose. I think it's still a bit too early. We are seeing great progress on the Joy and we're seeing a significant good sales momentum on the Pearl as well that we're involved in the deployment changes. But again, those ships had a very compressed sales window of nine months versus typically a 24 months sales window. So I would sit here today and say we are comfortable with our $0.30 and as we coursed out through the year, we'll take a look at that and if we think there's going to be a meaningful difference, we will certainly update you on that, but we're comfortable with what we had said. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks. And then second question for Frank \u2013 and I don't \u2013 Frank, I don't think you're going to answer this, but I think there has been a rumor out there that sounds like yourself and some of your cruise CEO colleagues did head to D.C. at some point about the Cuba situation. And I don't know if that's true. It's not true, but if it is true, can you give us any color in terms of potentially what came out of that and maybe how you feel about the current Cuban situation? Frank Del Rio : You've never been more right Steve. I'm not going to answer the question, not directly at least. Look, we as an industry, are together, we're cohesive on this issue. This is not a competitive advantage, where one company or one brand wins and the other one loses. We're all in the same boat, so to speak. So we're all working together to try to maintain what we have. We think it's good for the industry. We think that this is not the best way to pressure on the politics side, which I don't want to get into at all. But look, we just don't know at this point what we don't know. It's business as usual until it's not. And I don't even want to tell you whether I expect it to be different in the future or not because it's just so simply too early to know. This is government at work, it's not business and so we just have to wait and see. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Brandt Montour : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Frank, you talk about the book position not being able to grow indefinitely, which we all appreciate, and it also sounded like volumes on your book position would be up year-over-year, if not for mix. So I guess the question is when do you kind foresee reaching that tipping point when you start to leave volume on the table to get price? Frank Del Rio : There's a delicate balance between price and load, always has been. And if we're doing our jobs right, our booked position, at any given point in time, can't always be in an ever increasing position or we're just not trying hard enough to push prices higher. It's my opinion, my view that if you don't ask for higher prices, you're never going to get it. Nobody every volunteers than what you asked for. So today, we're very, very pleased at the balance between pricing and load. For example, we've not yet set our year-end load factor targets for 2020. But given what I know today, I doubt that we'll want to be better booked than we were at the end of 2018 for 2019 sales. Brandt Montour : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then you gave some good color on Oceania Regent's booked position for 2020 this quarter versus last quarter. But what type of booking behavior in seen on your further out booking cohort for the Norwegian brand? And any similar stats you can give there would be helpful. And that's it from me, thanks. Frank Del Rio : Yes, the Norwegian brand is on par with Oceania and Regent in terms of performance into the outer quarters and even into 2020. As Mark mentioned, all three brands are doing their part. And certainly for 2020, at this early stage and it's earlier for the Norwegian brand than it for booking curves. The longer more exotic, more expensive sailings tend to book earlier than the shorter ones. But all the \u2013 directionally, all three brands are pointing in the same direction. Brandt Montour : Great, thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas Allen : Hey, good morning. So you talked about in your prepared remarks having more less-than-seven-days trips in the Caribbean and the Bahamas. And you obviously shifted over to how much more are you exposed to last-minute bookings now or how much more of an opportunity you have there now versus last year? And then can this import net yield growth? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yes onshore cruises are up significantly year-over-year. Shore cruise capacity is up with 30 additional short savings. So it's a slight increase in exposure to closer in bookings but it's not material. That's just the natural booking window for those sailings that will closer in and we plan for that through our revenue management system. So it's a small increase to exposure. Frank Del Rio : Yes, and Thomas I wouldn't characterize it as being last-minute bookings It's just new normal, more compressed booking window pattern of those voyages. So it falls within our normal parameters of our revenue management system as Andy said. Thomas Allen : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just on fourth quarter bookings for the Caribbean. Any incremental color you can give there may be between East and West Caribbean or anything else? Thank you. Andy Stuart : We\u2019re seeing very strong fourth quarter bookings in particular for the Caribbean. We had tremendous response to Norwegian Bliss in the Caribbean. We're adding Norwegian Encore to the fourth quarter Caribbean for the Norwegian brand. And a new ship is always a real asset in driving demand into the region you launch it into the region you launch it into. So Norwegian Encore starts in November in the Caribbean. Very, very strong early start load and pricing and that really is the engine that will continue to drive a very strong Q4 Caribbean for us. So we\u2019re encouraged with where we are today. Frank Del Rio : Encore is the best booked Caribbean introductory ship ever. Andy Stuart : Yes. We're very, very happy and expect to see that continue. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. David Beckel : Hey there, thanks for the questions. So there's been a fairly large and high-profile entry to private island space in the Caribbean. And just given the similarity of your product versus one of your competitors, I'm wondering if you're seeing any pressure on pricing given the success pressure on pricing given the success that they've had with that product. Or is it more of a situation where a rising tide sort of lifts all boats, so to speak? Frank Del Rio : .: So I think the investments across islands, is good for the industry. These destinations drive tremendous guest satisfaction. We see that. I'm guessing the others see that too. And we think this will be another engine for growth as consumers see it as exciting destinations with a lot of activities, a lot of things to do, great feedback coming back. It's just going to be one more engine that continues to expand the industry. David Beckel : That\u2019s great color, thanks. And as a quick follow-up to that, what is your cruise passenger capacity to that island? And do you envision expanding that in the region at any point in the future? Thanks. Andy Stuart : Yes, I don't have the specific number but we're definitely expanding our capacity into the island. We've added a number of sailings on Norwegian Sun this year. As she\u2019s expanded into three-day and four-day market out of Port Canaveral. So calls in to Great Stirrup Cay are expanding. And I would expect that to continue as the fleet expands, the destination is getting the highest guest satisfaction across all of our destinations will receive more calls. David Beckel : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open Vince Ciepiel : Great, thanks. Mark, you walked through the 2Q yield guidance pointed to 4.5% like-for-like yield, which looks pretty much in line with the first quarter and maybe a little bit ahead what you were experiencing in 2018. So on a like-for-like basis, things remain impressive. But be curious on the 50 basis point raise to your full year yield, is that broad-based or would you just point to Joy or Bliss or like-for-like as being a bigger or lesser contributor to that 50 basis point raise? Mark Kempa : Yes, Vince, generally, it's broad-based. But I think we're seeing the growth coming from our core fleet. Again, we are starting to reap the benefits of our significant investments and revitalizing the fleet over the last two to three years. We're seeing that starting to pay off in dividends. So it's really coming from our organic fleet while at the same time, our new capacity is doing well. We told you in the last call that the Joy redeployment to North America was contributing about a point of our total yield growth for the year. And we feel that it's still performing in that zone. So the uplift is really coming mostly from our organic fleet but across the board. Vince Ciepiel : Great, thanks. And then maybe another one on yield now that you have a bit more visibility into both Encore and Splendor for 2020. I know it's still early, but historically, you've mentioned adding a Norwegian branded ship, maybe have some dilutive aspects to it just through the math of it but Encore early reads pricing quite well. So there maybe some questions to that and you've also alluded to Splendor touching nice premiums but being small as a percentage of the total capacity. So just curious as you think about the combined impact of those two ships heading into 2020, how you think that will relate to headline yield next year? Andy Stuart : Yes I think Splendor is selling well and it's \u2013 the revenue that we have on the books is we're very pleased with. So that could be a slight tailwind to our yield growth next year. However, it is only 1% of our total capacity. And as both Frank and Andy mentioned, Encore is doing well. And she's on track to be our best-booked Caribbean ship. But in all honesty, it's still a bit early. So my guess is maybe the two of those could be a slight push or a slight tailwind. But as we again cycle for the course of the year and we get more visibility on that, we will update you. Frank Del Rio : Encore will be, for 2019, slightly below the corporate average we expect. The great unknown [ph] will be her onboard revenue production, which hasn't occurred yet. Certainly, Splendor partly because of ultraluxury status and because of the all-inclusive nature of the brand, her yields are the highest of any of our ships, highest in the Regent brand. And like I said earlier, she is booking \u2013 the brand overall is booking way ahead of the 26% increase in capacity in 2020. So we like what we see the set up that we see for Splendor and Encore being major contributors to the yield and earnings per share growth. Andy Stuart : We\u2019ve got time for one more question operator. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Your line is now open. Jamie Katz : Just squeezing me in, thank you so much, nice quarter. I'm curious about UK and Europe. The commentary you guys have offered regarding your booking increases have been a little bit different than the uncertainty we've been hearing from the peer set. And so I'm curious whether you guys have also been maybe turning back your focus on sourcing in or whether you're still really forward for more geographic sourcing diversification, given your disproportionate tilt to the North American consumer? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yes Jamie as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, five weeks ago or so, we changed the go-to-market offering at the Norwegian brand in the UK and Germany from what we called Premium All Inclusive to the Free at Sea that we have throughout the world, and that's had a huge increase in our overall volume at comparable prices. So we've seen a nice tailwind coming out of the UK and Germany over the last five weeks, which overall has contributed to our business over the last eight weeks to be up in both volume and up significantly in pricing. So I'm glad to see the UK and Germany contributing a bigger piece of the pie to our overall business. And we think it ought to continue as we deploy more of our ships to Europe. We have six vessels, the Norwegian brand has six vessels in Europe this summer, and we think that will continue to be a catalyst for more business out of the UK and Germany. Frank Del Rio : We have time for one more. I think we do. We have three minutes to go. Anybody wants to make a quick question? Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. James Hardiman : Lucky me. Thanks for fitting me in here. So I had a quick question on costs, net cruise costs. Obviously coming into the year, we have the Encore and Splendor timing dynamic that hurt that net cruise cost number. Now sounds like there's some taxes, incremental taxes that are in that number. I guess how much of these costs go away it seems like most of those should go away next year? And as I think about that 1% to 2% normal rate, any indication of what that would look like for 2020? Mark Kempa : Yes, as I said in my remarks last call, we generally model 1% to 2% on an ongoing basis. In 2019, we're facing significant hurdles on cost. We\u2019ve incurring launch cost around Encore which we have no associated revenue. We have launch costs around Splendor, which debuts in January of next year. And then we have significant marketing costs around the redeployment. So I would expect some of those costs to drop off, and we should find ourselves in more of a normalization period in 2020, again, within that 1% to 2% band would be the expectation. Frank Del Rio : Well terrific. Well, thanks everyone, for your time and support today and as always, we'll be available to answer your questions throughout today. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder to all participants this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Andrea DeMarco; Vice President of Investor Relations and corporate communications. Ms. DeMarco please go ahead. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you Catherine and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andy Stuart, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line. Frank, will begin the call with opening commentary. After which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide updated guidance for 2019 before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website, at www.nclhlcdinvestor.com. We will also make references to a slide presentation during this call which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover just a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2019 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you Andrea and good morning everyone. For those that have followed our company and the industry over the years, the second quarter of 2019 was certainly one that will be long remembered. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, the quarter will be remembered for our strategic itinerary optimization initiative which included our entry into the new European home port and the launch of our largest Alaska deployment to-date with Norwegian Joy making her North American debut and joining her incredibly successful sister ship, Norwegian Bliss in saving to the last frontiers. The North American launch of Norwegian Joy was a runaway success, generating over $2.5 billion media impression and further elevating Norwegian Cruise Line's already preeminent position in the all-important growing and high-yielding Alaska market. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant-currency basis. My prepared remarks will also delineate the impact from certain headwinds including the change in Cuba regulations and a technical issue on Norwegian Pearl early in the third quarter. I am pleased to report yet another record quarter one where the company generated the highest second quarter revenue and earnings in its history. As you can see on Slide 5 adjusted EPS grew 7.4% over prior year to $1.30, primarily as a result of our revenue outperformance in the quarter which was driven by exceptionally strong onboard revenue and strong well priced close-in bookings. If not for the $0.06 impact from the Cuba regulation change, adjusted EPS would have exceeded our prior guidance by $0.03 or 12.4% growth over prior year. Turning to Slide 6, net yield increased 5.8% or 5% on an as-reported basis versus prior year outperforming guidance expectations despite 50 basis points of headwind from canceled Cuba sailings. This growth includes 100 basis points of corporate net yield dilution from Norwegian Bliss while she sail -- primary sails in the lower-yielding Mexican Riviera region, all of which was consistent with our expectations. If not for the Cuba impact, net yield would have increased to 6.3% or an 80 basis points beat versus our guidance. This strong growth comes on top of prior year's solid net yield growth of 4%. Turning to cost, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 6.1% versus prior year and 5.1% on an as-reported basis. Costs exceeded guidance for approximately 85 basis points which was entirely due to certain one-time charges in connection with the Cuba regulation change. Excluding these, costs would have been slightly favorable versus guidance as a result of timing in the quarter. Total fuel expense was in line with expectations as fuel consumption savings offset an increase in our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges which came in at $493. Turning to Q3, I'll direct you to Slide 7 to review deployment highlights. In the third quarter, our Europe mix is approximately 42%, an increase from prior year due to the addition of Norwegian Pearl. Alaska mix increased to approximately 21% as a result of the repositioning of Norwegian Joy while Caribbean is approximately 18%. Looking at expectations for the third quarter, core business fundamentals are strong despite headwinds in the quarter. In addition to the impact from Cuba, we experienced a technical issue on Norwegian Pearl in early July which affected approximately one month of a premium priced peak summer sailings in the Mediterranean. This issue impacted earnings by approximately $0.07 per share primarily in the topline. To demonstrate the strong underlying core performance of the business, I'll direct you to Slide 8 which contains our third quarter guidance together with the impact from the aforementioned headwinds in the quarter. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.75% or 1.5% on an as-reported basis and is net of an approximate 300 basis points impact from both Cuba and at their Pearl voyage disruption. This comes on top of strong prior year growth of 4% which included the benefits of premium priced Cuba sailings compared to the current year which now includes lower priced Bahamas cruises that will have to be filled in a very condensed sales cycle. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 8.25% or 7.75% on an as-reported basis. This is the highest growth quarter of the year, primarily due to incremental marketing expenses associated with Cuba and operating expenses associated with Pearl's voyage disruption which combined are expected to account for approximately 300 basis points of the increase. In addition we have the scheduled 18-day dry-dock at Oceania's Regatta as part of OceaniaNEXT Reinspiration program versus no dry-dock days in the prior year Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $492 with expected consumption of approximately 195,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the third quarter is expected to be approximately $2.15 which is inclusive of an expected $0.29 impact from both Cuba and Pearl. Exclusive of these headwinds, adjusted EPS guidance would have been $2.44 or 7.5% increase over prior year all on flat capacity growth. Turning to the full year, I'll walk you through the components of the revised adjusted EPS outlook on Slide 9. Topline outperformance in the second quarter combined with a stronger revenue outlook for the back half of the year resulted in an $0.08 benefit to the full year. Fuel, interest, and other savings accounted for approximately $0.04 and these benefits were offset by a $0.45 impact from the Cuba change and the $0.07 impact from the Pearl technical issue. As a result, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5 to $5.10. If not for the $0.52 combined headwinds from both Cuba and Pearl, our guidance would have been in the range of $5.52 to $5.62 or a 13% increase over prior year and would have exceeded the high-end of our guidance range provided in May. Looking at expectations for other key operating operations on slide 10. Net yields for the year is expected to increase approximately 2.6% or 2.1% on an as-reported basis, despite an expected impact of 180 basis points from Cuba and Pearl. If not for those headwinds, net yield growth would have been 4.4% and implies an increase to the back half of the year of almost 50 basis points versus the prior implied guidance for the same period. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 4.5% or 4% on an as-reported basis. The 100 basis point increase versus prior guidance is primarily due to the impact from Cuba and Pearl. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $487 with expected consumption of approximately 840,000 metric tons. Looking ahead to Q4, our implied net yield guidance is flat to prior year, which is inclusive of an approximately 330 basis points Cuba impact. It is important to keep in mind that we are rolling over Norwegian Bliss's successful inaugural Caribbean season out of Miami in 2018. This year, she sailed a mix of Mexican Riviera and New York based winter Caribbean sailings while Norwegian Encore will take her place in Miami with a partial quarter of sailings. As such, the combined yield performance of Bliss and Encore resulted in an expected dilutive impact to our corporate net yield of approximately 125 basis points. Focusing on the fuel environment. We continue to strengthen our hedge program and during the quarter increased our overall portfolio and also entered into our first swaps for 2022. While there is still a small amount of uncertainty in connection with a new IMO regulations coming online in 2020, we continue to expect our 2020 total fuel expense, net of hedges, to be on the higher end of our typical range of 6% to 7% of gross revenue. This is consistent with our expectations and is driven by an increase in volume from capacity growth as well as higher pricing. In addition, we continue to take advantage of the interest rate environment and we recently executed a two-year $450 million, costless collar to further minimize potential volatility in that line. This increases our fixed debt ratio from 75% to approximately 82% Looking ahead to the broader outlook for 2020, while it is too early to provide guidance we do want to provide an estimate of the flow-through of the Cuba regulation changed to 2020 earnings. Based on our best estimates today, we believe the impact to be approximately $0.20 to $0.25, which primarily represents the loss of the premium pricing on the top line that our Cuba sailings garnered versus similar Bahamian or other itineraries. That said, despite the impact from the regulation changes, we continue to be on a strong path towards achieving our full speed targets that we laid out at Investor Day in May of last year. Focusing on shareholder returns, we have previously communicative that we would take a balanced approach in returning to shareholders $1 billion to $1.5 billion of capital through year-end 2020 via share repurchases and/or potential initiation of quarterly dividends. Despite our continued outperformance, the earnings multiple for our company has contacted to record or near-record lows, which we believe reflects a significant disconnect between our share price and our long-term value and future growth profiles. Hopefully, Frank's earlier commentary regarding the strength and consistency of our business fundaments alleviates the concerns that are weighing on our valuation. In the meantime, with our stock trading at a more than 50% discount to the S&P 500 average, we continue to use opportunistic share repurchases as the primary vehicle to return to shareholders. We continue to look forward to a time, when our stock price reflects the long-term strong fundamentals of our business. But given today's evaluation our Board of Directors believe that the most efficient way to return capital is through the opportunistic share repurchases, while still maintaining focus on our desired leverage targets. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentaries. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. As I previously mentioned, Norwegian Encore remains the best booked Caribbean-introduced ship in the Norwegian brand's history, handily outperforming sister ship Norwegian Escape debut back in November of 2015 in both the number of cabins sold and in pricing. On slide 11, you can see some of the highlights that have helped stoke demand for Encore sailings. From the exciting thrills at the aqua park, the Encore Speedway, the high-tech Galaxy Pavilion and laser tag course, the new culinary introductions such as Onda by Scarpetta. With a ton of our next call we will have welcomed Norwegian Encore to the fleet, and she will be making her way to New York City to begin a two-week introduction tour that will include a variety of special events capped-off by her inauguration in Miami on November 21. Encore's debut along with that of Seven Seas Splendor in February of 2020, the record booked position at higher prices at all three of our brands, the full year benefit of Norwegian Joy sailing itineraries in the West and the expected exploration of cash generation, and capital returns to shareholders as part of our full speed ahead targets, lay the foundation for 2020 to be more than just another milestone year. Before handing the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave everyone with a trio of key takeaways from today's commentary, which appear on slide 12. First and foremost, we delivered record results in the second quarter despite the external headwinds discussed. Second, our core business fundamentals are stronger than ever with 2019 on track by record year and 2020 following in her footsteps. Lastly, we are well positioned to achieve our 2020 full speed ahead targets. And with that, I'd like to open up the call to Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. And our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Thank you. And thank you for all those colors. Very helpful and a confusing quarter and good quarter. Either Frank or Mark, I just wanted to circle back to the $0.45 impact from Cuba, which was that of the high end of your previously disclosed range I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about the different parts, moving parts in that number? And how come you came in that -- what drove you towards the high-end versus maybe being able to mitigate some of the impacts given how strong your business is? And while we are on the topic of mitigation, just wondering Mark with the $0.20 to $0.25 impact next year, just from the redeployment of the Cuba cruises, wondering how you would characterize that outlook. Do you think that there would be ways to further offset that number and if not on the top-line maybe some of the things you are seeing on the fuel side? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Sure. Thanks, Felicia. So Cuba happens what June 4th, June 5th. We put out a guidance range, our best estimate I think three days later maybe on the fourth day. And, obviously, it was a very fluid situation. We had estimated $0.35 to $0.45. And I think the important note I tend to keep a notice that roughly one-third of our Cuba sailings were our high-ends brands combined with Oceania and Regent and the remaining were Norwegian. So not only did we issue significant refunds through voyages I believe that were through September, we also canceled the remaining voyages for the year. So we -- number one first and foremost, we wanted to make sure that we were taking care of the customer. And as we move forward, Cuba can be thought about in two parts. There's the premium of that Cuba guest over a similar itinerary, which I think we have set traditionally is in the zone of 25 plus percent. But then there's the short-term impact, which is really the dilutive nature of having to redeploy that capacity in another short market and starting from a zero passenger base. So while we\u2019re leaning on the high end right now, it is a short cruise market. We are seeing positive signs. We're not concerned and we're going to do everything in our power to improve that number. As we roll over to 2020, again I think it's very important to keep in mind that over 30% of that capacity with Cuba intensive high-end brand impact. So while we estimate right now that the impact is $0.20 to $0.25, it's early. We are going to strike hard to beat that. And, of course, we're always looking at our cost line to figure out, is there ways where we can mitigate. That\u2019s something we never stopped doing. Mark Kempa : If I just may add, Felicia that as we look to mitigating impact of Cuba in 2020. There are two items that we\u2019re hopeful. It can be better than what we are estimating today and that is the redeployment of the Oceania vessels to the Mediterranean, Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and the back half of 2020 and how well Norwegian Sun performance in Alaska. It will be our third consecutive year of double digit growth in the Alaska market. On one hand it shows you how bullish we are in the Alaska market. We think of that we've got the best product mix there and believe that this introduction is slightly different type of product, smaller vessel, more itinerary intensive that will do well. Any itinerary has the potential to match Cuba yields, it's Alaska. Felicia Hendrix : And Mark just to understand what you said with the $0.45 impact that you're forecasting this year from Cuba that actually as we cycle through the year could end up being better if things work out better than expected? Mark Kempa : Yes. I think the point is that, again a lot of the -- this is a short cruise market. We have some visibility, but it's a close-in booking window. We are not something right now, but we are seeing positive signs that hopefully we can beat that. Felicia Hendrix : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Your line is open. Harry Curtis : Hey good morning everyone. Frank and Mark, I'm trying to make sure that our numbers are right on what the earnings power in 2019 would have been, had Cuba and the mechanical issue not occurred. And you are sailing your more traditional -- so the $0.07 for the pod malfunction has been called out. And am I right in thinking that between the pod and Cuba that your normalized earnings would have been closer to roughly $5.40 a share? Mark Kempa : I think Harry you're probably a little bit light there. I think if you refer to slide 9 on our deck, if Cuba and the Pearl which is the combined impacts of $0.52 have not happened, we would have guided in the zone of $5.52 to $5.62 or a $5.57 midpoint. That would have been -- a year-over-year growth on roughly 2.5% capacity growth for us this year. Harry Curtis : Right. So that's assuming that you would have that -- say the Oceania ship and the Regent ships were sailing in the Caribbean and you still would have been able to achieve a $5.55, $5.60 level? Mark Kempa : No. No. We -- look Cuba is an impact and we really took it on the chin hard with the upper brand. So the fact that they are either sailing in the Caribbean or they're doing some other exotic itineraries, we can't absorb all of that. But again had Cuba and itself had not changed, we would have been looking at a 13% year-over-year EPS growth. Harry Curtis : Okay. So -- but what I'm trying to do is get to the middle ground assuming that your ships were on a more normal Caribbean sailings and our numbers are coming to roughly $5.40? Mark Kempa : Yes. I think, I see what you were saying. So we said that we are assaying $0.45 impact from Cuba. I think if you parse that out there is roughly $0.10 to $0. 12 of that is really onetime operating costs and the nature of port obligations that we have to extend an incremental marketing expense. So if you take that out and that gets you into the $0.35 zone, that's all your revenue impact. And then what - the way to think about that is, that's combining the true premium of the Cuba itinerary versus an alternative itinerary, but in that there's also the piece that is the dilution because you have quick sailings on starting from a base of 0 in a very short sales cycle. So I think when you rolled out over to an annualized basis that's where you get to our $0.20 to $0.25 impact. Frank Del Rio : The other I would like to add impact, on a normal basis we wouldn't have had the Oceania and Regent ship at the Caribbean tier of operation to begin with. So it's a little bit not apples-to-apples to say well if you had always had to ships in the Caribbean without Cuba what would they have been. They would never been in the Caribbean. You don't put high-end vessels in the Caribbean basin in the peak summer months. It's just not where the best and highest use of vessels. Harry Curtis : And then the related question is for 2020, you're so confident in double-digit earnings growth. And do you have any sense of what the increment could be if you deployed maybe $1 billion plus to share repurchase to your earnings growth? And that's all for me. Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Yeah. Look we're still targeting -- we're still comfortable with double-digit earnings growth. And I can't comment on potential share repurchases in the future. That's purely up to our board but it's certainly something we're looking at. Harry Curtis : Okay, very good. Thanks fellows. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Steven Wieczynski : Hey, guys good morning. So I think if we me simplify all this \u2013 all the noise that\u2019s out there around Cuba and the Pearl, and if we go look back and look at your original yield guidance back in February, I think your yield guidance was 3% to 4%. And I think now if we exclude all that, you're basically at about 4.5% if my math is correct. And for the most part your cost assumptions are only up slightly. So I guess my question is what\u2019s been the biggest delta around that original yield guidance and where we sit today? Is it been a specific market? Is it on board or is it just a combination of a lot of different factors? Mark Kempa : Well yes. Thanks Steve. I think, first of all, yes you're right we\u2019re targeting about 4.5% if we excluded those items. And that actually represents I think just under a half a point of increase for the full year, but more importantly it also represents almost a half a point of increase in the back half of the year. So I wouldn't say that there\u2019s really been any big delta. We've been continuing to see strength in all of our core markets and we're seeing it's a strong robust demand environment. In terms of onboard revenue, I think we delivered on the face of our financial statements, roughly a 5.5%. And as I say every quarter if you take away the GAAP allocation due to our transfer pricing that number is really closer to about 10% or 11% on a normalized basis. Now a good significant portion of that is driven from the Joy and that accounts for about half of that. So if you strip that out, we're still looking at the zone of 5% to 6% of solid onboard growth. So the consumer is alive and well, they're spending money, they're spending significant amounts on board. Our ATF continues to be up double digits, I thank were up over 11% or 12% on 6% capacity growth in the same period, and we're reselling tons of future cruise certificates on board as I always say. So we see a very healthy consumer who\u2019s willing to spend money. Frank Del Rio : Yeah. And the way they are spending money has evolved over time. We see greater spending on experiential activities such as short excursions, spa treatments, specialty restaurants and all those are high margin venue if you will and that's helping generate the year-over-year onboard revenue growth that Mark was talking about. Steven Wieczynski : And then my second question Frank, your commentary around Alaska, which I think is a market that is concerning for a lot of folks, not only investors. But I think some of your competitors as well. I guess why is your commentary so much different around Alaska in terms of how well you guys are doing there? Is it really just a hardware issue at this point? Or is there something else you can may be point to? Mark Kempa : It's never one thing. The incredible hardware we have in Alaska certainly helped for Norwegian brand. The fact that we have an improved terminal in Seattle, I think the itineraries that we deliver with our Glacier Bay which is the number 1 graded destination in Alaska as you might know, we put the press release out the U.S. park department just issued us the largest number of permits for the next 10 years for our ships to visit Glacier Bay. All of that contributes to a buzz in a marketplace. Travel agents understand that the Norwegian brand would be -- with the observation lounge that we have on Joy and Bliss which is perfect for Alaska cruising; all the high-tech gear that we have on board that the young kids love and as you know the Alaska season coincides with summer vacation for children. There are cruises onboard, Joy and Bliss that have over 1400 children onboard and they are driving all this. And so, there is a great buzz out there about do you want to go to Alaska? You go on Norwegian Cruise Line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So I want to drill a little deeper on your fuel comments for 2020. Are you assuming spot IFO and spot MGO prices in that number that 6% to 7% of gross revenue and so that you're not assuming any downward pressure to the price of IFO from IMO 2020 policies? And is there anything more specific you can tell us for next year other than the high end of 6% to 7% of gross revenues? Because ultimately we don't know your revenue forecast and I think even a 10 basis point change in revenue is a pretty meaningful amount to the high end of being 7% or 6.9% which kind really move the needle. So any additional color you can flush out there would be helpful? Mark Kempa : Yes. Thanks Jared. First on the pricing, no, we do not use the spot rate. We consistently use the forward curves for both U.S. Goldcoast 3% for our heavy fuel oil and we use the gas oil curve as a proxy for MGL. So again, we are taking into account at any given time what the future slopes of the curves look like, at that point in time of the market. In terms of more guidance in 2020, yes we have said it's roughly 6% to 7%. I -- translated that into dollars, you're probably looking somewhere in the zone of, I would say 18% to 20% in terms of dollars over this year, somewhere in that zone think would be a good guide for you to think about. Jared Shojaian : Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And then just one quick follow-up for me, on the 2020 thinking in terms of potential double-digit growth your, 12% ROIC target would seem to imply double-digit growth of something more meaningful than just 10% EPS growth. So correct me if I'm wrong on that, but is that how you're thinking about the 12% ROIC as being double-digit earnings growth more than just 10%? Mark Kempa : While -- we've always said double-digit earnings growth. I am not going to elaborate on what that specific number means. But obviously, you are correct. You can calculate back into what our ROIC has to do and we have some work cut out for us. With the Cuba issue that comes right off the top and we have to find offsets for that so. We have to work a bit harder, but as I said in my commentary we're still on a strong path toward meeting targets and we are marching to that end. Jared Shojaian : Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Hey good morning. So there are some articles out this week about Venice closing the center of the city to cruise ships. Is that something that you're concerned about? Frank Del Rio : Not overly concerned. Issues regarding Venice and big ship have been thrown around for the last decade or so. This year the issue has risen or the volume has risen a bit because of one incident in Venice, this spring in one year incident. And so there are factions within the broad Italian bureaucracy that we want to see some controls over. Big-big ships going to Venice are going down the main canal rather versus others who will understand clearly the economic impact that any kind of restriction of cruise customers would having on the abroad Venetian economy. We have 70 calls in 2019 and about the same number scheduled for 2020 that call on Venice. Half of them are from our Oceania and Regent brands who operate small vessels, who are not it's all impacted by the rhetoric that you're hearing. And there are several alternative berth in and around a Venice that should it come down the to the bigger ships not being able to embark and disembark guests in the same places they do today that are alternatives that can work for the industry. We don't quite frankly expect to see any major changes in the near term. But this is governments, and governments can do anything they want to do. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. And then just -- I was looking at your deployment schedule for 2020 and I know it's small, but you're leaving the Canary Islands and putting more capacity into the Baltic. Can you just talk about the rationale there? Andy Stuart : Yes. We're always optimizing itineraries and that was an opportunity for us to redeploy a vessel at one of our lower yielding itineraries into a higher-yielding itineraries. It is something that the team has always focused on the winter Canary's itinerary was one that we've been operating. And it's simply being the lowest yielding itineraries we have and you'll continue to see us do that, try to find out lowest yielding itinerary and replace it with higher-yielding alternative. That's how we are generating value of the same-store fleet. It's an ongoing process. Thomas Allen : Any way to quantify the benefit? Andy Stuart : Yes I don't have the specific numbers here but its definitely positive. Frank Del Rio : Definitely a positive move. If you've ever been to winter Canaries. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from a Brandt Montour with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brandt Montour : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, another kind of question on 2020. So I know it's still early to talk about net yield growth, but maybe you could just help us by reminding us the broader puts and takes with regards to differences in hardware year-over-year comparison wise? Frank Del Rio : Well, unlike 2019 where we took delivery of no new ships, 2020 we have in essence a full year benefits of Encore, our newest biggest vessel in the Norwegian fleet. And we have 10 months of Regent Splendor, which will be the by far the highest yielding ship in our fleet and possibly in the industry at the 26% increase in the capacity for the Regent fleets. And as I said earlier she's ahead -- not only is of the ship ahead of any newbuild that Regent has ever introduced, but the brand itself is ahead in load considerably versus this time last year and in pricing. So, those two should be good drivers of yield in their individual brands. Remember the yield conundrum that we have at the each level with big ship coming in from the Norwegian brand that generates incredible EBITDA, incredible cash flow, incredible net income but often times it's dilutive to the corporate yield. So this is where we stress to the analyst community, the investor community that you want to look at our bottom line growth and our top line growth, but don't get hung up on yield growth necessarily, because sometimes it gives you a false indication of what the strength of the business is. Brandt Montour : Okay, great Thanks. And then shifting gears. So the commentary in a release on the script about share repurchase and capital allocation preferences there, how does that change the equation if at all when thinking about the boy\u2019s intention to eventually implement the dividend? Frank Del Rio : I didn't -- can you repeat the last part? The intentions of what? Brandt Montour : The intention to eventually implement a dividend. Frank Del Rio : Yeah. Look we are refocusing our allocation strategy. We've said we always wanted to have a balanced approach. But look, we\u2019re trading at record lows, we're trading at eight times forward earnings, which is just a tremendous buying opportunity. So we are not taking dividends off the table. I want to make that very clear, but when you look at the best way to deploy your capital today at today's share prices, it just makes more sense. So we will continue to evaluate that with our board at each quarter and we'll advise you accordingly. Mark Kempa : Nothing will -- they initiate a dividend when the price of the stock the multiple, more than the price of the stock the multiple, reflects what it should reflect. The fundamentals of this business, of this industry, all the benefits that this industry has that I don't believe the broader investment community is taking into account because if it did, the multiple of our industry and of our company specifically would be significantly greater than today. Brandt Montour : Excellent. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Our next question comes from Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Your line is open. Jaime Katz : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, piggy backing on one of the last questions, I guess the implication for 2020 is really that we go back to this normalize spread where yields start to grow faster again than cost. Is there anything on the cost side that we should be made aware of like higher dry dock days next year that could maybe prevent that from happening? Mark Kempa : Yes, I think we always talked about 2020 that we should be able to achieve some cost leverage just from our scale benefit. When you look at dry docks, I think our dry dock days are slightly up next year. I don't have the exact number in front of me. We do have a lengthy dry dock for the Norwegian Spirit in the Q1. So I think we\u2019ve said consistently, we\u2019re going to have about 8 to 10 dry docks per year as our fleet -- some of the bigger ships get into their 5-plus years of age. But in terms of costs we are leveraging. We are going to continually -- it's not something we do when there is a winner\u2019s pressure on the business. Every day we are looking at where we can find efficiencies and where we can now leverage our scale. And we do that in the name of not impacting the brand, not impacting the customers and not impacting the quality of the product we are delivering. So we're certainly focused on that and we're going to work hard to continually push on that front. Jaime Katz : Okay. And then just on a housekeeping basis, it looks like the capacity growth next year is expected to be 8.8%. That was up from last quarter, it was 8.2%. But I think there were some changes with Pearl on the second quarter. Is that the only delta? Or is there anything else that has changed for capacity growth next year? Mark Kempa : Yes, it's really just a function of some of the Pearl that happened this year and then you have some shifting and I optimization of dry docks in next year. So it's just fine tuning of our deployment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Stephen Grambling : Thanks for sneaking me in. Two quick follow-ups. First on our Encore, so you did mention you have the best book in Caribbean history. At this point is the net yield trajectory approaching the company average? Or should we still assume a drag from that asset? And then second slide four is pretty interesting. Do you have a mix between relevant and irrelevant supply for 2019? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yes, so first on Encore, so Encore this year, if you keep in mind I think she is sailing for about -- about five sailings this year. Two of those sailings are holiday sailings, the other three are really what we call shoulder holiday period sailings which frankly speaking, don't do that well. But as you look forward into Encore in our Caribbean season she is pricing well. She is doing -- again our best Caribbean book to shipped. And at this stage I think what we see right and in the first quarter or so she's going to be somewhere in line with our corporate average yields. If you recall Bliss in Q4 of 2018 exceeded our corporate average yield, so we are very hopeful that and we have a good visibility that I think Encore can do the same. Now she rotates out of the Caribbean into Bermuda for the summer selling season so well that will be a little bit of a shift in dynamic. But again, very powerful engine. And in terms of relevant capacity, are we pulling that number? I'm sorry for 2019 relevant capacity, we look at about 35% and the remainder is not relevant. There's a lots -- and in that relevant capacity there's quite a bit of shifts that are in Asia/China that we believe we don't compete with. Q \u2013 Stephen Grambling : Great. Thank you so much. Helpful. Andrea DeMarco : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay our next question comes from James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. James Hardiman : Hey good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in here. A couple of clarifications. I guess, the first on Steve question about Alaska. Obviously, mix is playing a pretty big role in Alaska with some new ships there, which given the higher priced itineraries is certainly beneficial. But is there any way, despite all the moving parts in Alaska, to look at like-for-like pricing in Alaska? Is that up this year? And I guess, the reason it's a particularly important question, as we fast-forward to 2020 it's seems like Alaskan capacity is going to be pretty stable. I guess, the question would be, do we still think Alaska is going to be accretive to yields in 2020, just given sort of what's going on in that market? Andy Stuart : Yeah. I'll give you a little bit of color on that. I'll start with Bliss, because obviously same ship year-over-year. The difference is we're lapping inaugural season. But what's happened in 2019 and in the peak of the season, the pricing is roughly flat here in inaugural season, which is really unusual. So we're very, very pleased with how Bliss has performed year-over-year like-for-like. In the shoulder season, she's in line with our expectations. And as one would expect first ship lapping inaugural season, so Bliss has done well. Joy, sort of, meets the criteria, you mentioned in your question, which is, different ship, but we're very pleased with Joy's introduction. She's well ahead in pricing of the ships she replaced in Alaska, so I'm pleased with Joy. And Jewel, based in Vancouver, the mid-sized ship based in Alaska, is doing very well. Again, in the peak of the season, she's beating pricing year-over-year and in line with expectations outside of the peak. So pretty happy with that. If we look out to 2020, with Alaska's really meeting expectations with higher pricing again. So we're really encouraged with Alaska. I echo Frank's comments that the new ships in Alaska, it was time for new ships in Alaska. And these ships in particular have been a very, very well received. So I'm pleased with this season, optimistic for the outlook. And really see the Norwegian brands with these new ships is leading that market. Frank Del Rio :  And I may add that we won't have the challenges of selling Joy, a very large ship in a very abbreviated 8, 9 month booking cycle like we did this year when we announced her departure from China. We have a regular 18, 24 month booking cycle in front of us. So that's certainly going to help Joy in particular, but also whatever bleeds through there for the rest of the fleet to having more normal booking cycle for Alaska. So thanks everyone for your call, your participation -- did you have a follow-up I'm sorry? James Hardiman : I did, if I could fit one in here real quick, Frank. So, slide four I thought was a really interesting way to look at the whole capacity conundrum, the relevant versus the non-relevant. Maybe speak to how that's trended in terms of the relevant, because it's less about the absolute number in terms of capacity and more about how it's trending. If we look back to previous years and then the next handful of years, is relevant capacity accelerating meaningfully? Or is it pretty stable in terms of where do you\u2026? Frank Del Rio :  I think if you go backwards to 2017, 2018 and 2019, there would be more blue than black, because in prior years there were less ships going to China, less ships going into the national brands that we discussed and the expedition market almost didn't exist. Going forward, I would expect if I had 2022, 2023, 2027 in there, my guess is that probably would be roughly 50/50, no worse than 45/55 going the other way. So it's going to stay relatively flat I believe. Again capacity growth is an overblown metric that at this point and everyone's involvement in the industry I can't believe it's still out there. This is a grossly underpenetrated industry, less than 4% of the world has cruised, less than 2% of the world spend on hospitality, they spend on cruises. There are more hotel rooms in Orlando and Las Vegas combined than there are cabins in the world cruisely. I don't know how many more examples I have to give you. We take on 26% growth in one particular brand and it's full at higher prices. So find some other excuse because this one is just not a good one to focus on. James Hardiman : Perfect. Thanks, Mark. Frank Del Rio : All right. Thanks everyone. This concludes today's call. And as always very thankful for your time and your support. I'll see you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter as well as provide updated guidance for 2019 before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make references to slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2019 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. There are a few important parallels between the second and third quarters of 2019 that I'd like to point out. First, the third quarter, like the second, marked another record-setting quarter for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings as we posted not only the highest quarterly revenue in our history, but also the company's highest ever quarterly net yield. At nearly $301 per day, the third quarter marks the first time net yield has ever surpassed the $300 mark, not just for our company, but for any of the major cruise operators. Even more impressive is that the record revenue and record net yield came in a quarter in which we experienced a 1.8% decrease in capacity days. Also like the second quarter, the third quarter benefited from a continued strong demand environment that once again proved that the consumer, especially the North American consumer is alive and well. And lastly both quarters benefited from our strategic initiatives around itinerary optimization, particularly in Alaska and Europe where we grew capacity in the quarter by 17% and 13% respectively. Also similar to what we experienced in the second quarter, we overcame external and non-controllable headwinds both known headwinds and new ones, demonstrating once again the resilience of our business model and the power of the go-to-market strategy utilized by our big global brands. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. As you can see on Slide 6, strong revenue performance in the third quarter, primarily driven by exceptionally strong onboard revenue and strength in close-in bookings drove earnings above expectations with adjusted EPS of $2.23, beating our guidance by $0.08 despite a $0.06 impact from Hurricane Dorian. The quarter experienced a direct impact from Dorian from three items. First was the cancellation of two voyages as a result of the extended closure of Port Miami, which forced us to reroute two of our ships; Norwegian Breakaway and Sun to New Orleans resulting in lost revenue and additional costs to repatriate guests back home. Second, where multiple itinerary changes not only for ship sailing from Florida but for ships operating up and down the Eastern Seaboard as many of the ports were closed as a cautionary measure while awaiting the path of the weather system. And lastly, our hurricane relief efforts which totaled approximately $3 million. If not for this impact, adjusted EPS would have grown to $2.29 on a decrease in capacity days of 1.8% and would have exceeded our August guidance by $0.14 and the prior year's record of $2.27 despite the impact of Cuba and Pearl. Turning to Slide 7. Net yield increased 3.9% or 3.3% on an as-reported basis versus prior year on a capacity decrease of 1.8%, outperforming guidance expectations by approximately 215 basis points. Stripping out the noise in the quarter, core fundamentals remain strong. And if not for the previously disclosed impacts from Cuba and Pearl, coupled with Dorian, net yield would have increased 6.7%. This growth comes on top of prior year's robust net yield growth of 4%, which included both the benefit of premium priced Cuba sailings and the premium priced inaugural Alaska season for Norwegian Bliss, compared to current year which included lower-priced Bahamas cruises that had to be filled in a very compressed sales cycle. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 11% versus prior year and 10.2% on an as-reported basis, making Q3 the highest growth quarter in the year consistent with our expectations. This increase was a result of unanticipated costs due to Dorian, such as guest repatriation and costs related to relief efforts along with incremental marketing to bolster sailings in 2020 combined with expenses outlined in our prior call, which included the scheduled 18-day dry dock of Oceana's Regatta, marketing expenses for sailings previously containing Cuba calls, and operating costs associated with Pearl's technical issue. Fuel expense for the quarter was slightly higher than expectations due to an increase in fuel price per metric ton net of hedges which came in at $504 versus guidance of $492. Turning to Q4. I'll direct you to Slide 8 to review deployment highlights. As our ships repositioned to their winter deployments, there are two focal markets for the quarter : the Caribbean and Europe. Our Caribbean mix is up approximately 39%, which is down versus prior year with capacity decreasing approximately 8%, primarily due to the extended European season for deployment of Norwegian Getaway and Epic along with the addition of Norwegian Pearl to the region. Europe mix for the quarter increased to approximately 18%, representing a nearly 40% increase in capacity as a result of the extended season. Looking at expectations for the fourth quarter on slide 9. Core business fundamentals are strong, despite an expected incremental $0.09 of headwinds, driven by lower pricing and higher expenses entirely due to Dorian. Let's focus on net yield first. As a reminder keep in mind that our Q4 outlook includes the expected dilutive mix impact of approximately 125 basis points for the combined performance of Bliss and Encore in the quarter. Further this quarter also includes a scheduled dry dock of the highest yielding ship in the fleet Regent Seven Seas Explorer. Dorian's 110 basis point drag on net yield as a result of the one-two punch of Cuba sailings being converted to Bahamas-only sailings combined with the near-term dampening of consumer demand for Bahamas sailings from the extensive media coverage surrounding the storm. That said, the good news is that the pricing impact we are seeing from that is expected to be fully offset in the quarter by strength in the core Caribbean, resulting in an improved outlook for net yield, compared to our prior implied guidance. And as time passes and we distance ourselves from the impacts of Cuba and Dorian, the booking window will return to normal and more importantly half of our capacity in the Bahamas basin will reposition to other higher yielding destinations such as Alaska beginning in early Q2. To better illustrate the strength of our core top line fundamentals in the fourth quarter when you strip out the noise from Cuba, Dorian and the mix impact from the new Norwegian ships that results in an expected 5.7% increase in net yield over prior year solid growth of 4.7%, which as you recall benefited from the premium priced Cuba sailings and Norwegian Bliss' incredibly successful inaugural Caribbean season. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 2.25% or 1.75% on an as reported basis, which represents an increase of less than one half of 1% on an annual basis. The increase is primarily due to costs to repair damage to our private islands infrastructure and to replenish its various beach fronts as a result of the erosion caused by Dorian. Higher than expected dry dock costs required to harmonize Explorer to that of its sister ship Splendor, higher inaugural expenses for the extended launch activities of Norwegian Encore in Europe, New York and Miami and slightly higher sales and marketing expenses to further bolster the successful launch of Splendor and support the Regent brand's 26% growth in the year. Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges to be $498 with expected consumption of approximately 221,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $0.69, which includes an estimated impact of $0.26 from Cuba and Dorian. Exclusive of these two items adjusted EPS guidance would have been $0.95, an increase of approximately 12% over prior year. Turning to the full year. I'll walk you through the components of our revised adjusted EPS outlook on Slide 10. The year benefited from topline outperformance in the third quarter combined with a stronger revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, primarily in the core Caribbean resulting in a $0.14 benefit to the full year. Accretion from the 150 million in shares repurchased in the third quarter accounts for $0.03 and foreign exchange fuel and other savings of approximately $0.03. These benefits were partially offset by the aforementioned marketing and dry dock cost of $0.05 and a $0.15 impact from Dorian of which $0.10 is attributable to revenue and $0.05 is attributable to costs. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS to be in line with the midpoint of our August guidance of approximately $5.05. To put the year in perspective, if not for the $0.67 of combined headwinds from Cuba, Pearl and Dorian our guidance would have been approximately $5.72 or an approximate 16% increase over prior year and would have exceeded the high end of our original guidance range provided at the beginning of the year. Looking at expectations for other key operating metrics on Slide 11, we've increased our outlook for net yield growth for the year by 40 basis points to now be up approximately 3% or 2.4% on an as-reported basis versus August guidance despite the impact from Dorian. If not for this headwind, net yield growth would have increased another 25 basis points to 3.25%. And if not for Cuba and Pearl as well, net yield growth would have been approximately 5%. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 5.75% or 5% on an as-reported basis. The 125 basis point increase versus previous guidance is primarily due to the impacts from Dorian and the previously mentioned items. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $490 with expected consumption of approximately 836,000 metric tons, focusing on the fuel environment on Slide 12, we continue to strengthen our hedge program and during the quarter increased our overall portfolio. While there is still a small amount of uncertainty in connection with the new IMO regulations going into effect on January 1, we continue to expect our 2020 total fuel expense net of hedges to be on the higher end of our typical range of 6% to 7% of gross revenue. This is consistent with our previous expectations and is driven by an increase in volume from capacity growth as well as higher pricing, primarily related to the shift in MGO consumption from 30% to approximately 60% in 2020. Looking ahead to the broader outlook for 2020, while it is still too early to provide guidance we want to provide some puts and takes and a few items to keep in mind. First regarding Cuba, as Frank mentioned earlier, the impact diminishes in 2020 to the previously disclosed expected range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share for the full year. This impacts the first half of the year in the topline due to the loss of the premium pricing that our Cuba sailings garnered. Second, Norwegian Bliss is lapping her successful inaugural first and second quarter of sailings stepping down from the pricing premium that inaugural seasons customarily command. Lastly, the accretive benefit to yields from Seven Seas Splendor which was offset by the expected dilutive impact of Norwegian Encore. And in terms of dry docks, 2020 will have a higher number of dry-dock days versus 2019, including two extended dockings of approximately 40 days each for Norwegian Spirit in the first quarter and Pride of America in the second quarter. In terms of the cadence for net yield growth. The aforementioned puts and takes are heavily weighted to the first half with Cuba alone providing a 200 basis point drag. As a result, first and second quarter net yield growth is expected to be below the typical range of net yield growth that we normally aim to deliver. All-in-all it's steady as she goes and 2020 is expected to follow in the footsteps of 2019 as another record year. While we have work to do to offset the multiple headwinds we've weathered over the last few quarters, our business fundamentals remain strong and we continue to be on a solid trajectory toward achieving our full speed ahead 2020 targets that were laid out at our Investor Day. Focusing on shareholder returns on slide 13. We took advantage of current valuations and executed $150 million in share repurchases in the third quarter. We have now returned over $1 billion since the beginning of 2018. This represents approximately 9% of our shares outstanding or 19 million shares in total. Of that total $750 million is related to our full speed ahead 2020 targets and equates to more than half of the midpoint of our capital allocation target under the program of $1 billion to $1.5 billion by the end of 2020. Our Board of Directors continue to believe that the most efficient way to return capital to our shareholders is through opportunistic share repurchases. As such and until the market valuations begin to reflect the proper value of our company, we will continue to use this method as the primary vehicle to return capital. Our goal is to eventually have a more balanced approach to capital allocation and we will continue to evaluate the potential implementation of a dividend with our Board. As for the balance sheet as you can see on slide 14, it continues to strengthen and we have rapidly delevered since the acquisition of Prestige in 2014 by nearly four turns with net leverage at approximately three times at the end of the quarter. By year-end, we expect leverage to modestly elevate primarily due to the debt associated with the delivery of Norwegian Encore where we have little or no earnings benefit in the quarter. Excluding that debt leverage is expected to be approximately three times at year-end. We expect our net leverage to continue to decline over the next four quarters, primarily through strong earnings generation and scheduled debt amortization. Before turning the call back to Frank, I'd like to discuss one metric we feel is vastly underappreciated, our cash generation. Despite operating in an extremely capital intensive industry, coupled with our strong growth profile, our cash generation is expected to accelerate as we continue to realize the powerful earnings accretion, our core business model provides, as well as the incremental earnings power from the addition of Norwegian Encore and Seven Seas Splendor to the fleet. This positive cash generation provides us the flexibility to continue to return meaningful capital to shareholders while also making prudent investments for the future to further enhance returns. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Earlier in my comments, I mentioned the enthusiasm that we have for the growing Alaska market, which has let us to make significant investments to further strengthen our presence in this high-yielding cruise market. Prior to the arrival of Norwegian Bliss, we solidified our partnership with the Port of Seattle by renovating their terminal at Pier 66 and we continue to cultivate various other partnerships in the region, aimed at developing both port and guest-facing infrastructure projects in key ports that will facilitate our growing presence. Our itinerary-enhancing projects include a new pier in Ward Cove in Ketchikan, the purchase of the last waterfront parcel in Greater Juneau and a development of a second pier and customer-facing attractions at Icy Strait Point in Huna; all of which will give our guests enhanced experiences onshore as they explore the last frontier and give all of our brands a leg up on the competition. We are also investing in the guest experience onboard our ships, with Norwegian Spirit entering dry dock early next year, is the last ship to enter the Norwegian Edge revitalization program with the most extensive bow to stern renovation in the company's history. The updated elements onboard Norwegian Spirit will take the guest experience to the next level, with new venues and a look and feel consistent with our recent newbuild launches and which touch every aspect of the ship with every venue stay and public area being completely revitalized to prepare her for her sophisticated travelers that will sail on her exotic itineraries throughout Africa, Asia and Australia. The combination of a better than new ship at a fraction of newbuild prices and immersive itineraries in the APAC region will benefit our strategic global sourcing strategy of attracting the highest-yielding guest with an unmatched value packed offering in the region. As I close up my remarks, I'd like to give a brief update on our ESG initiatives which are summarized on slide 15. As I stated earlier, we recently reactivated our Hope Starts Here program in the wake of Hurricane Dorian, delivering needed food, supplies, equipment and substantial monetary aid to the Bahamas and continue to provide aid wherever we can assist. On the environmental front, we continue to make significant strides in our efforts to reduce single-use plastics onboard our vessels. Earlier this year Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises partnered with Vero Water and recently Norwegian Cruise Line announced its partnership with JUST Goods to replace all single-use plastic water bottles with environmentally-friendly reusable and recyclable bottles across its fleet by January 1 of next year, making Norwegian their first major global cruise line to go plastic water bottle-free. Lastly, on the governance front. This morning Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings was honored by the Women's Forum of New York for its commitment to greater female representation on its Board of Directors. Today, women comprised 30% of Norwegian's Board with backgrounds ranging from corporate executives to senior officers in the Armed Forces. Our commitment to diversity, however, extends well beyond gender. We are also committed to both social and professional diversity. And today 60% of our directors come from diverse backgrounds, which we truly believe will enhance our ability to better compete in an increasingly complex global environment. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'll refer you to slide 16, which contains our key takeaways for this call. First, strong demand drove outperformance on the top line and on earnings beat versus guidance despite impacts from Hurricane Dorian. Second, our core business fundamentals remain strong for the remainder of the year and well into 2020. Lastly, we remain on a strong trajectory to achieve our 2020 full speed ahead targets. And with that I'd like to open the call for questions and answers. Operator? Operator : Thank you Mr. Andrea  And our first question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, good morning everybody. Frank starting with you, just getting back to your earlier commentary for third quarter and fourth quarter, you sounded bullish around pricing for the remainder of the year and into next year. So as you look towards 2020, I was wondering if you could talk about what may have changed since you last updated us in August. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've seen an acceleration in demand, but I couldn't tell if that was referring to the remainder of this year or 2020? Frank Del Rio : No. It's primarily into 2020. 2019 is just about done Felicia. So we have seen over the last four to six weeks an acceleration of our overall business demand into 2020. And really into 2021 the booking window as I mentioned has expanded 10% quarter-over-quarter -- excuse me, year-over-year. And I think that is as good an indication of the strength of the overall industry and particularly of our company as we're able to drive both load on 8.7% increase in capacity and at higher prices. I can't stress enough what a trifecta win that is that you can raise prices, extend your booking window, increase your load in the face of what is an unusually high year-end capacity growth. So we're very, very happy with our performance. We continue to fine-tune our itineraries away from lower-yielding regions to higher-yielding regions. And it's all coming home to roost and we just couldn't be happy with our performance this year and what we expect to be another tremendous year next year. Felicia Hendrix : Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow up to that your outlook did also highlight that you're seeing stronger revenues driven by the Caribbean in the fourth quarter. You did mention you've seen booking low following Dorian and much of the 110 basis points impact was due to that in the fourth quarter in terms of net yield. But I'm just wondering as you look at the booking window and pricing for the Bahamas now relative to your normal booking windows and pricing is where are you in terms -- now versus normalized? And is any of that leading into the first quarter or the first half? Frank Del Rio : Yes. So it's good that you mentioned Bahamas separately from the Caribbean because core Caribbean both western deployments and eastern deployments are strong higher load, higher pricing. Bahamas is the issue and a short-term issue as we distance ourselves from the impacts of Cuba. Remember, when Cuba came into the picture, a ship that went to Havana was also going to the Bahamas. And so we stopped calling those sailings Bahama cruises and instead of calling them Cuba cruises. Well now with Cuba out of the way they're back to being Bahama cruises. And the Bahama cruises. And the Bahama cruises are being impacted by several factors. One of the fact this time last year we were in Cuba. And so the year-over-year comparisons are night and day, in terms of pricing, because Cuba's demand at such a high price. Number two, the effects of Dorian, which shortened the booking, the attractiveness if you will of the destination. And in our case because Cuba was so strong, we had more capacity in the Cuba/Bahamas region than we normally would. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we move into 2020, we will be moving those vessels that had been in the Bahamas had been in the Caribbean, out of those regions and into higher-yielding markets such as Alaska and the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia. So it is temporary as we move forward sequentially, the effects of Cuba diminished, the effect of Dorian disappear. But yes in Q4, as you saw in our release, the Bahamas is what is dragging down pricing to the tune of 110 basis points. Mark Kempa : That's exactly right. And just to add on that. If you look at our Q4 yield, our prior implied guidance was flat. But excluding the impact of Dorian, we're actually up about 110, 120 basis points and that's all primarily coming from the Caribbean. So again, we're seeing strength in that core market in the forward view. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. So we won't hear anymore about the Dorian in the first quarter, it sounds like? Frank Del Rio : Not as much. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Frank I guess a question for you. I mean obviously, the forward booked position continues to expand, your booking windows expanding. Have you thought about taking some more risk right now and not just on the pricing side but just on some of the -- I guess pricing decisions in terms of your deposit policies? I know I think a year or two ago you raised the deposit date to 120 days. Is there any thoughts to raise that even longer? And then some of your competitors have focused more on the nonrefundable side. I know that's not really an area where you guys have explored. Can you just talk about that opportunity and how you see that as something that you could expand into? Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Jared. As you know and something I stress in every call, we already have by a very, very wide margin, the highest yields in the industry, not only in ticket but in onboard. That doesn't happen by chance. It happens because we work it every hour of every day, always looking for opportunities to raise prices across our three brands and we do. And so when you ask me if we're focused on or if we're doing anything on it that's all we do. That's the primary focus that we have is the combination of our go-to-market strategy, which means that we invest marketing dollars to stimulate demand in the marketplace versus reducing prices. And whenever we believe that the booking window, booking curve combination allows us, we take prices up. It's why we constantly are looking for the optimization of our itinerary is always moving ships to higher-yielding itineraries. Why we're so bullish on Alaska? Alaska used to be a three- month season : June, July, and August. So now we're seeing -- we're getting there in April and we're not leaving until October. It's now a six-month season of very, very high-yielding, not only on ticket, but incredible high-yielding on onboard. And so we're going to continue doing that. We're taking Spirit out of the winter Canary Island marketplace, one of the historically lowest-yielding areas and we're sending her after her a refurbishment out to Asia, Australia, Africa, more exotic itineraries to take advantage of our huge customer base, our past guests files that have never been to those areas because we've never sailed to those areas before. So all these things help the selling process of lower marketing costs, higher occupancy, higher yields, more revenue, more earnings per share, and I think that our performance over the last four or five years prove that that philosophy that strategy works. Jared Shojaian : Okay, thank you. And Mark just maybe a question on cost, can you talk about what that incremental marketing is that's hitting this year that's for 2020, maybe why you took the marketing up? And then historically you've talked about ex-fuel unit cost growing at a 1% to 2% range. This year is an unusual year with all headwinds, ex-fuel unit costs up 5%. If I look at next year, maybe as a starting point 1% to 2% and then subtract out the 170 basis points you're calling out for Cuba, Pearl and Dorian, why is that not the right approach to look at it? I know you called out the higher dry docks for next year but you're still at 5% this year versus, call it 1% to 2% in a normal year. So can you help me think about that a little bit better? Mark Kempa : Yes. So, thanks Jared. Let me start with the marketing side. So, listen, we've stated publicly we have a go-to-market strategy. We are not afraid to spend marketing dollars when we're going to get a minimum 4 to 5x return and hopefully greater on that. And I think you see that coming through in our net yield performance. We continue to outperform and beat our guidance and beat our expectations and that's not just by happenstance. It's through strong onboard revenue, strong ticket pricing. It's across the front. So that's something we're not afraid to do and we'll continue to do where it makes sense as long as we're driving more incremental benefits to the bottom line. And as far as 2020, again, it's a bit early. Yes, our costs are elevated in 2019. And as we look forward we should see some benefit rolling into 2020. Yes, we do have higher dry dock days by about -- I think it's about 14 more additional days in 2020. But for now we're going to maintain our stance that we're going to -- we're still thinking about 1% to 2% on our cost side and we're going to do everything that we can to outperform that. But as we're still finalizing our operating plans with the business for next year, we'll give you better guidance on that in our February call. Jared Shojaian : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, good morning, guys. So, first, I want to dig into the third quarter a little bit, the yield beat a little bit more. And I guess the question is you beat your yield guidance by around 200 basis points, which obviously is very, very strong and that's after you already had kind of a good one month under your belt when you gave that guidance. So can you help me understand a little bit more how the last two months, the third quarter why they performed so well? Mark Kempa : Sure. Yes. Steve, this is Mark. So, as I said in my commentary, extremely strong onboard revenue spending. And again whatever inventory we had on the books at that time, we were able to sell it at good pricing. But I don't want the -- I don't want you guys to underscore onboard revenue power. If you look at -- I say this every quarter, if you look at our onboard revenue year-over-year, I think on a reported basis, it was somewhere in the zone of 4% to 5% up and when you adjust that for all of the GAAP allocation transfers that we have to make as well as the incremental benefit from the Joy, our core onboard revenue was up mid-single-digits. So, that's strong and we continue to see that. And I always tell you guys that is really our canary in the coal mine. We watch that day-in, week-in, week-out and we continue to see that strength coming through the business. So, we're pleasantly surprised. The consumer is alive and well and they are not afraid to spend money. And combining that with our -- many of our pre-cruise initiatives where we're getting a lot more of that consumer's wallet before they ever step on the ship that has -- continues to be extremely beneficial for us and we continue to hone our strategies around that. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Thanks Mike. And I guess as we look out to next year, your forward commentary obviously is pretty upbeat around what you're seeing right now. If we kind of look at where our consensus yields are next year which are hovering let's say 2.7%, 2.8% right now, I understand you're not going to bless that number. But I guess what I'm trying to understand here is, is it fair to say pricing and load factors are up in all four quarters? And if you already said that, I apologize. And Mark you talked about the first quarter, second quarter being below your normal range or expectation. I don't think you're going to answer this, but can you remind us what your normal range or expectation is? Mark Kempa : Sure. We typically advise that we aim for a 2% to 3% combined company yield growth. And that obviously equates when you look at each of the individual brands, it's a bit of a higher yield expectation for each brand when you consolidate it. So, looking -- when you look at the first half as I said we are rolling over Cuba which we've -- is about a 200 basis point drag. So, I would not expect that you're going to see that 2% to 3% year-over-year growth for the first half. It will be somewhat lower than that. But again on a full year basis, we're still comfortable that we're going to model within that range and we'll achieve those targets. Steve Wieczynski : And Mark, sorry, did you say that -- is pricing and load factors up in all four quarters right now? Mark Kempa : Yes. You are 100% correct. I thought Frank had said that in his prepared remarks that we are up in pricing and load for all four quarters in 2020. Frank Del Rio : Across all-- Mark Kempa : Good point. Steve Wieczynski : I apologize if I missed that. Thanks guys. Really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandt Montour with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brandt Montour : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, thinking about the Caribbean in the first half, I'm just going to kind of pile on to this, but it's slightly different question. If you would be able to strip out Cuba and any kind of Dorian impact, what would the book look like in terms of pricing and volume year-over-year in magnitude versus where you were this time looking out? Frank Del Rio : Sorry, it's very difficult to hear you Brandt, so I apologize, but I think you're asking what would our outlook look like if we stripped out Cuba and Dorian, is that -- was that your question? Brandt Montour : Apologies. Just the -- how the book stacks up in the first half in Caribbean if you stripped out Hurricane Dorian in terms of volume and price, like the magnitude? Frank Del Rio : Yes. We -- like I just said on the last question, we're up in both price and volume for all four quarters and that we - when we talk about that we are adjusting on a similar basis for Cuba because you have to. That was a significant book of business. So -- on a similar basis, we are up and load in that first half. So... Brandt Montour : Okay. And then on Alaska, obviously a lot of details on the projects that you guys announced recently. Can you give us any more extra color around sort of the longer-term ultimate upside in not only capacity, but like you said the upside to let's say pricing and onboard from those \u2013 from your enhancement that you guys have there? Frank Del Rio : Well we're going to continue testing the market and seeing how much additional capacity, we can allocate to that market as time goes by. So over the last three years we -- three years ago we had the Norwegian brand for example three, 2,200 passenger ship. In 2020, we will have 12,000. So we're almost - we've almost doubled our capacity in Alaska over a 3-year period. And we don't think we're done. If we thought we were done we wouldn't be making the investments that we're making. So we think that we've got a strong a presence in Alaska as anyone and I think it's going to get stronger as we finalize these investments. As you know Alaska is a slotted area. The best example I have for you is the Glacier Bay permits that are granted by U.S. Parks Department. We were very fortunate to win another 10 years. I can't tell you how huge that is. It's sort of a -- the cornerstone of our deployment strategy there. It is the number one destination that people want to visit in Alaska and we got this for 10 years. And so we're now adding to it and to make sure that we have the berth capacity to bring our largest ships to the region. And again it's very strong ticket prices and incredibly strong onboard pricing for our Alaska itineraries and we want to take advantage of as much as we can. Brandt Montour : That's great. If I could sneak one more in here, how should we be thinking about returns on those projects that you just announced? Frank Del Rio : Well I think they pay for themselves over and over again. Alaska is a destination-centric region. You've got to have the land programs in place and we're taking the leadership role in developing these very hard to come by the land capabilities. But I'm not -- I struggle to give you a percent ROI, if you will. It's all going to be flown through our net ticket yields and that answer has got to come a little bit later. Mark Kempa : Brandt this is around strategic positioning, making sure we have the proper ports, destinations that the consumer wants to go to. We know there's not a lot of space left in Alaska to go to, right? It's the last frontier so to speak. So we are securing that for a long-term basis. We know we get premium yields out of there. So we will see that -- those returns come through in the top line but difficult to measure just from the specific initiatives that we're doing. Brandt Montour : Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead. Harry Curtis : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow-up on the -- on Mark's comments about the first quarter -- or the first half drag. It sounds like it's a tale of two halves. So how much visibility can you share with us do you have in the second half? I think the reason the stock, kind of, fell out of bed when those comments were made was that typically you don't have much visibility. And so there is some question about the second half. So it might help to share with us what details that you do have? Mark Kempa : Sure. I'll start off and I'm sure Frank will jump in here. But look we have tremendous visibility on our second half books. We always have. And I think we've even mentioned in our prepared remarks that the premium brands are going to turn the year at 70% sold for 2020. Our remarks around first half and second half were really just to give you some cadence in terms of don't expect the yield in the first half to be as high because we're rolling over very difficult comps from Cuba. And that's just reality. At back half, we will see a benefit from that. So we are not implying in any form or fashion that we would expect our full year yield guidance to be out of our range of 2% to 3%. We fully expect that. It's just going to be a front half, second half story. Frank Del Rio : And not because of performance, but because of year-over-year comparisons. First half has five months of Cuba in 2019 and 2020 has zero. Harry Curtis : Thank you for that clarification. Second question, you talked about deposit growth and a decent amount of that is probably tied to the new capacity coming. So, are you able to give us a sense of if that deposit growth looks as encouraging on your core fleet as well? Frank Del Rio : Yeah. As I mentioned, our advanced ticket sales, liability, if you will on the balance sheet, which is what you're talking about is up 12.5%. Our forward 2020 capacity growth is only 8.7%. One, the deposits are outperforming the capacity growth by 44%. So, yes, Encore is part of the reason why we're up 12.5%. But adjusted for capacity growth, it's obviously much broader than that. I can't give you a number per ship or per type of vessel or per brand. But if you just look at on the face that it's outperforming the capacity goes by 44% you ought to get a lot of comfort that we're selling more than we were this time last year at higher prices. Another data point is the fact that our booking window has stretched by 10% year-over-year. So look, I can't stress enough the underlying strength of the business. We have weakness in Q4. We've had weakness in Q3 and Q4, because of Cuba and the effects of that because of Dorian. 2020 is going to be a heck of a year. And we see no -- like I said, last quarter and I'll say again, we see no measurable decline in the consumer's enthusiasm for cruising and for cruising on our three brands. Harry Curtis : Thanks, everyone. Frank Del Rio : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thomas Allen : Thanks for fitting me in. So just one question. Just the prior question, where you talked about still feeling confident in kind of that 2% to 3% net yield growth in 2020. You also talked earlier about seeing mid-single-digit onboard growth currently. Do you need to continue to see that to reach 2% to 3% growth next year? And what are kind of the gives and takes to think about to kind of continue that onboard growth? Thank you. Mark Kempa : Yes. So look onboard growth as Frank said earlier, we punch it -- we're looking at a day-in day-out, what can we do? How can we extract more dollars from the consumer? How can we get that consumer earlier into our ecosystem pre-sell? We don't bake that in in terms of our forward guidance. So if you look at our history, most of our beats in the last, I don't know, eight to 10 quarters, a good majority and the vast majority has come from the fact that onboard revenue continues to outperform. So we typically model onboard revenue somewhere around the neighborhood of 1% and we continue to do that and we're pleasantly surprised while we have great visibility on it. You just never know. Sometimes that casino player can win, sometimes they lose. But we don't need the \u2013 continued 5% growth to hit our 2% to 3% numbers. What was the second part of your question? Thomas Allen : I mean what -- any gives and takes to think about what will influence that 5% but you basically answered it but any other color? Mark Kempa : No. I think it's going to be again a continued strong consumer and our ability to continue to reach the consumer earlier in the booking cycle before they ever go on the ship. That is a key differentiator for us and a key item that really helps us outperform. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Well, thanks everyone for your time and support. As always we will be available later today to answer any other questions you may have. Take care. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Daniel, and I will be your operator.  As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. I\u2019m joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which, Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter and full year as well as provide guidance for 2020 before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make references to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today\u2019s call. Before we discuss our results, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2019 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea and good morning everyone. We have a lot of ground to cover today and we fully understand that there is one topic on top of everyone\u2019s mind. So while we will address the coronavirus outbreak in detail, I will begin my commentary first with a brief overview of our record 2019 financial results, after which I will turn to 2020 and discuss the impacts of the outbreak. We aim to be as transparent as possible, but with the virus situation as fluid as it is and with so many unknowns at this time, please understand that there may be questions you have to which we simply will not be able to give you definitive answers to. So let\u2019s begin. The 2019 storyline for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings can be best described in one single word, resilience, a theme that will surely carry over into 2020 as they confront the effects of the virus outbreak. Focusing on just 2019 and with headwinds from the sudden cessation of cruises to Cuba and the impact of Hurricane Dorian the year that just ended allowed us to demonstrate once again the strength and resilience of our business model. A model founded on operating three award winning global brands in each of the industry\u2019s major categories; a focus on sourcing the best guests from around the world, but anchored in North America consistently diversifying our deployments and quickly redeploying vessels as needed depending on market conditions; and our go-to-market strategy of emphasizing value over price as the main lever to drive demand. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics, on a constant currency basis. In addition, unless otherwise noted, 2020 guidance figures exclude any direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. We continue to monitor this situation and its potential impact to our results. I\u2019ll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full year results followed by our 2020 outlook. As you can see on Slide 8, strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter, driven by strong pricing for close-in bookings and better than expected onboard revenue drove earnings above expectations with adjusted EPS of $0.73, beating guidance by $0.04, inclusive of the previously disclosed $0.09 impact from Hurricane Dorian and $0.04 of headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. We continue to focus on strengthening the foundation for our company\u2019s future growth. As you can see on Slide 16, several of the initiatives underway demonstrate our deepening commitment to enhancing our environment, social and governance strategy. One of these initiatives was the launch of a dedicated ESG department which will coordinate closely with departments across the organization as well as with the technology, environmental, safety and security committee of our Board of Directors. From our commitment to greater female representation on our Board of Directors, which was recently recognized by the Women\u2019s Forum of New York to our significant contributions to emergency relief in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian and in Australia to help combat the devastating bushfires, our company has stepped up in meaningful ways. On the environment front, we receive positive marks, a B minus in our first disclosure to the Carbon Disclosure Project better known as CDP. We are also focused on developing key port infrastructure. This spring, we will officially unveil the Pearl of Miami are stunning game-changing terminal right here at Port Miami, which is being constructed to LEED Gold standards and where we first welcomed nearly 25% of all guests we board annually. We also continue to develop several projects in Alaska to ensure and enhance our presence in this important and very profitable market. These initiatives marked the latest steps in our continual efforts to strengthen our presence in strategic ports and destinations around the world. Lastly, we were incredibly pleased with the reception of Regent\u2019s newest ship Seven Seas Splendor, which has outperformed her record-setting sister ship, Seven Seas Explorer, who was introduced in 2016. And coincidentally, after her Transatlantic crossing from the shipyard, Splendor arrived in Miami today to prepare for her christening. Splendor is truly magnificent and deserving of her billing of luxury perfected. She is resonating with both new and loyal past guests alike, which is why she is garnering the highest yields in our fleet. And I\u2019ll bet the highest yields of any Ocean cruise ship in the industry. I look forward to showing her off to our valued past guests, travel partners, media, and the investment community throughout her upcoming inaugural sailings and at her christening ceremony, which will be held tomorrow evening at a black-tie affair at Port Miami. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I like to leave you with some key takeaways from our call today on Slide 18. First, the company once again demonstrated the resilience of its business model in the face of several significant headwinds and delivered another year of record financial results in 2019. Second, we entered 2020 in a record book position with strong booking activity through late January, prior to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. We have taken aggressive and proactive steps to protect our guests, crew and our long term brand equity by modifying, canceling or redeploying 40 sailings to significantly reduce our exposure in Asia. And lastly, we continue to lay the foundation for our future growth, including initiatives around ESG, port infrastructure and new build. And with that Daniel, I like to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Your line is now open. Harry Curtis : Good morning, everybody. My question is related to your comment, Frank, about not getting too excited, at least being too early about the notion of current bookings stabilizing. I think it\u2019s probably worth giving additional color on that. And particularly, what are your agents saying about their customers rebooking interest at this point, particularly in some of the markets that really have not been impacted domestically in Continental Europe and Alaska? What are they seeing there? Frank Del Rio : Yes. Thank you, Harry. Look, as I said earlier, business was just sailing right through to the end of January, and then the virus really became a headline news. And as you know, the cruise industry was at the forefront, unfortunately, of headline news for reasons that we know. And that has caused near panic in the traveling public. And so we\u2019ve seen a meaningful decrease in new bookings, we have seen meaningful increases in cancellation, not just for our Asia sailings, but throughout the deployment. And the decrease in bookings is similar to what we see \u2013 we have seen in past similar events, whether they be geopolitical during the financial crisis, et cetera. What\u2019s a little bit different about this one is the increase in cancellations. The good news is that over the last five booking days beginning Saturday, that decline has moderated. So that we are no longer seeing week-over-week acceleration in the declines of bookings and increasing cancellations, we\u2019re seeing a moderation and I\u2019m hopeful. And again, I could only say hopeful because it\u2019s five days does not make a definitive trend. But I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ve seen the worst of the booking slowdown, and we can begin the healing process that, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, typically takes about eight weeks to after the end of the peak new cycle before consumers return to more normal. But our travel partners, our business partners tell me that what they\u2019re seeing across their broad portfolio of business is similar to what I\u2019m talking about. Business is soft, people are scared to travel, not just on cruise ships. But first, on airplanes, in many cases, long-haul destinations do require customers to, first, get on an airplane before they get on a ship. And right now, we have \u2013 people are scared. People are worried. And until we see the leveling off of new cases, the cruise industry, not being the poster child for the virus. This may continue for some time. Harry Curtis : Thank you, Frank. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. As a follow-up, just on Coronavirus and the $0.75. Can you just quantify how much of this is from cancellations, modifications, on Asia itineraries cancellations on other itineraries and/or any impact that\u2019s estimated to net yields in existing markets for moving ships? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Hi, Steve, it\u2019s Mark. Yes. So the $0.75 is what we know today for all of our canceled and modified sailings. We were very explicit to say that this does not take into account any sort of indirect potential impacts on future demand. So as we said in our prepared remarks, we had over \u2013 we had 40 sailings, which were somehow impacted, 21 of those have been redeployed out of Asia to Eastern Europe, Eastern Med with a very short condensed booking window. But more importantly, we cancel \u2013 outright canceled 10 voyages, eight of those voyages came off the OCI and Regent brands. And you have to remember, those are very long lead booking itineraries with very high Per Diems. Those voyages were completely sold out. And they span a time period over the next two to 2.5 months. So we canceled though. That\u2019s a significant impact for us. So we have not taken into account, we just do not have enough information to give a reasonable assessment of what the future could look like from a softer demand picture. Stephen Grambling : Great. And maybe a very quick follow-up. Frank, you mentioned that the consumer spending typically are returns eight weeks after the peak of the news cycle. When you look at the data, do you typically see a catch-up in demand as that alleviates? Or does it take effectively a full year of lapping that to see the normalized trend? Frank Del Rio : No, it doesn\u2019t take a full year, but it\u2019s not instant mashed potatoes either. I mean, there is somewhat of a modified V-shaped, U-shaped return. But we saw it in \u2013 last time, we saw this was in 2016 after the string of geopolitical events that occurred. 2017 was a very good year. 2018 was even better. So again, it all depends on the duration, severity extent of this very fluid situation. Stephen Grambling : Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is now open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, thank you so much. And thank you for the very clear data in this confusing time. Frank, I was wondering if you could talk about your strategy on price integrity. I know you said you\u2019ve been seeing a small improvement in the past five days in terms of bookings and cancellations, and you just touched upon that again. But can you discuss how you\u2019ve been thinking strategically about stimulating demand and how sacred are your strategies to not use price as a demand driver? And then I just wanted to clarify something that you said, just in terms of your prior kind of goals, the full speed ahead. I know that you have the $0.75 impact and that affects free cash flow and all that. But given where our estimates are in terms of free cash flow in 2020? I mean, it seems like a little bit of a drop in the bucket. So just wondering if you\u2019re opting to keep your powder dry? Or will you seek to take advantage of the stock price dislocation? Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Felicia. That was seven or eight questions in one. I\u2019ll try to remember them all. Felicia Hendrix : It was one question. It was a long one. Frank Del Rio : I\u2019ll take the last one first in terms of our cash flows. Look, any time, you lose $0.75 of earnings per share, cash is impacted and all the other metrics that revolve around earnings get impacted like ROIC, which is why we\u2019ve withdrawn our full speed ahead targets, at least through 2020. Look, we\u2019re going to look at the overall situation, the risk reward profile, the price of the stock to see how we move forward with our capital allocation. We\u2019re still committed as much as ever to return meaningful capital to shareholders. As you know, when the year began, the thought was that we were going to continue taking advantage of dislocations in the market of our stock price, with the hope that we can introduce a dividend in the back half of the year. While I don\u2019t want to say that those goals are off the table for this year. I think those goals may be more difficult to achieve this year, given the unknowns surrounding coronavirus. Pivoting to the question of pricing and how does this affect our go-to-market strategy, I will tell you that we\u2019re not going to allow what we believe is a temporary situation to derail us from our long-term proven go-to-market strategy of focusing on value to consumers over using low price as a lever to stimulate demand. Having said that, given what we\u2019re seeing in Q2 primarily, and what our competitors \u2013 how our competitors are reacting you\u2019re going to see pricing action across the spectrum, we need to stay competitive. But we will not do it in a way in which we believe will hurt the long-term brand equity and our long-term desires to increase pricing year-over-year. I remind you that there are companies that have not yet returned to their pre-financial recession back in 2008 yield levels. And that is something that we guard with our lives literally. So I think you\u2019re going to see because of competitive pressures, some pricing deterioration in the short term, we will focus, again, the way we go-to-market with value-focused offers as opposed to outright decreases in price. But I think, overall, I think you\u2019re going to see yields decrease in the short term. Felicia Hendrix : I just want to clarify. When you said \u2013 I just wanted to know when you say, you will see some pricing deterioration in the short time, you mean among competitor, not from you? Frank Del Rio : Well, I think, us as well I mean, we can\u2019t just stick our head in the sand and say, we\u2019re not going to respond. We\u2019re going to compete in the marketplace with that elusive customer, we do it in a way that does not have price as the main driver. But I imagine and I forecast that you will see a combination of pricing action from us, but heavily skewed towards, again, the value proposition to lure that customer that may be out there. Mark Kempa : And Felicia, this is Mark. One other thought on our cash flow question. We\u2019ve been very vocal to say that we are going to be free cash flow positive this year. And we still intend to be free cash flow positive. We are spinning off significant amounts of cash. So while this does put a small dent in the outlook, it certainly does not derail us. Felicia Hendrix : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is now open. Steven Wieczynski : Yes, good morning, guys. Mark, if we go back to the $0.75 impact that you guys called out. I want to clarify something. I guess, does that $0.75 assume those canceled sailings don\u2019t get rebooked? And I guess, a better way of saying that is we use Norwegian Spirit, for example, are you assuming any kind of yield contribution from those changed itineraries? Or are you just assuming those 21 Spirit itineraries are canceled? I guess, what I\u2019m saying here is it seems like that number might be a little bit high to us. Mark Kempa : So I will answer that question in two parts, Steve. So the first part is, of the 10 canceled sailings, we are not trying to resell those. So that is a definitive loss of revenue. On the remaining sailings that primarily the Spirit, yes, we are redeploying her. We are putting her back on sail. But what you have to remember is we are essentially starting from zero. It\u2019s not an itinerary, where we went from region A to region B that was right next door where you can lure the customer in. So we\u2019re essentially starting from a zero base. So we do anticipate that there\u2019s going to be some yield dilution on that itinerary. So it really represents a delta on what we were expecting to get out of Asia with the Spirit versus the close-end nature out of the Eastern Mediterranean. Steven Wieczynski : So if Spirit actually books out okay over the next couple of months. That $0.75 would be lowered. Is that fair? Mark Kempa : You\u2019re absolutely correct. If it exceeds our expectations on rebooking and getting her back to a good load factor where we anticipate we are certainly going to take price action. We\u2019re not going to leave price on the table if the demand is there. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And then, Frank, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions from investors over the past couple of weeks about \u2013 what\u2019s the \u2013 and this is impossible to probably say, but I think there\u2019s a fear that this virus is going to have a material long-term impact on bookings and crews, in general. And with headlines of Diamond Princess being called a floating prison and stuff like that. I think investors are absolutely panicking right now that this is going to linger for a long time. And I guess, the question is how do you counter that? Or how do you \u2013 do you think this is just another kind of blip on the radar and things will go back to normal? Or how would you kind of attack that? Frank Del Rio : Yes. Look, nothing is permanent. Consumers do have a relatively short memory, thank God. We have seen in the not-too-distant past other major events affecting the cruise industry that will quickly overcome and that may be brand or company specific. One of the reasons we took the aggressive action that we took in canceling cruises and moving complete \u2013 the fleet completely out of Asia, is that we don\u2019t want a repeat of what happened in Japan to refer to any of our brands. So among the things that we have done, Steve, is to withdraw our fleet from Asia. That is a big step one. Luckily for us, we\u2019ve never had a major presence in Asia, less than 6% of our annual capacity was deployed to Asia. We had zero base in the Chinese market, which is the market, I think that we\u2019ll take it on the chin in the short-term more than anywhere else. And we\u2019re good marketers. We know how to market our product. We market value over price, and I think that our go-to-market strategy will serve us well in these challenging times, more so than if all we did was drop price. So I remain confident that the long-term viability of this company is superior to others in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s on the cruise industry or the broader travel industries. It\u2019s a great, young fleet, new ships, exciting products to offer, terrific management team. And so while no one wants to go through what we\u2019re going through today, especially on the heels of what was a great 2019 and what promises to be even a greater 2020, I think that the long-term earnings potential of this company, the cash flow generation of this company, the way that we\u2019re going to grow earnings, ROIC and return meaningful capital to shareholders has not changed. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you.  Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Brandt Montour : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to talk about the 1Q guidance ex virus. I\u2019m just trying to understand, maybe you could remind us what the Cuba impact was in the 1Q as well as one of your larger peers had a \u2013 in 1Q that also kind of surprised people on the downside and maybe called out Australia and bushfires and a couple of other things. So I was wondering if there was any other things you could kind of peel back for us in trying to understand maybe the like-for-like clean net yield in the 1Q? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Hi, Brandt, this is Mark. So as we\u2019ve said in prior commentary, the Cuba impact was the main drag year-over-year when we look at the first half. And that primarily, obviously, that impacts both Q1 and Q2. So we\u2019ve said that Cuba this year, on a rolling basis, is about $0.20 to $0.25 of yield impact. That\u2019s split relatively evenly between Q1 and Q2. There\u2019s a bit of a delta there. But that is the \u2013 when you look at the yield, that\u2019s the core headwind that we\u2019re looking at ex the coronavirus. As we said in our prepared remarks, our brands prior to this outbreak, were doing well. We were booked ahead. We were booked at higher prices. We haven\u2019t touched on it much today, but our onboard revenue, when you look at our Q4 onboard revenue, it continued to perform very, very strong. We had great results in our first month of 2020, January, it exceeded our expectations. And even onboard revenue now that consumers who are on the ship today, they are still spending more and more money across the Board. So once the consumer is there, they\u2019re not afraid to spend. So but Cuba was a tough comp. So \u2013 and we\u2019ve always said, upside, apart from that really comes on the back of onboard revenue. Brandt Montour : Thanks for that extra info, that\u2019s helpful. And then just quickly on the virus situation in sort of the shorter-term bookings commentary that you guys have made. You\u2019re looking at the data, are you seeing any sort of differentiation between customers that are booking sort of any shifting preferences to locations that are further away from Asia or other areas that might be sort of deemed \"safer\u2019? Anything like that you can call out? Frank Del Rio : The impact of the virus on bookings and cancellation has been pretty even across the Board. When you peel back the onion and do a deeper dive. What we\u2019re seeing is, especially by the American customer, those destinations that they deem to be safer are faring better than others. So for example, Alaska and the Caribbean. They\u2019re closer to home. In many cases, you don\u2019t have to get on an airplane to get to the Caribbean ports those seem to be doing better than some of the more exotic or far-flung destinations. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas Allen : Can you quantify how many sailings and passengers carried you\u2019ve had year-to-date? And then how many cases of coronavirus you\u2019ve had? Frank Del Rio : Are you kidding me? Do you know who you\u2019re talking to, which company you\u2019re talking with? There is absolutely zero. There\u2019s been only one company with coronavirus outbreaks, one, and it\u2019s not us. Thomas Allen : So could you say how many sailings you had So that people understand that you\u2019ve had lots of sailings? Frank Del Rio : Dozens. Dozens of sailings. Dozens. Next question, please. Thomas Allen : So a follow-up question, is there a way to quantify how \u2013 if bookings were \u2013 so I assume the commentary you\u2019ve made so far about bookings being weaker has been for about the past month. If bookings went back to normal tomorrow, is there a way to quantify the indirect impact? Frank Del Rio : There will be no indirect impact. Thomas Allen : But you said there\u2019s been weak bookings for about a month so\u2026 Frank Del Rio : Next one up on the lineup please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I will ask a non-coronavirus related question, just given the amount of focus so far. On the CapEx guidance, can you just talk about why that came up for 2020 and 2021. And the initial guidance for 2022 is also higher than I would have expected. I think it\u2019s a record year. So can you just talk about what\u2019s driving that? Why raise CapEx at this specific time? And then what kind of flexibility do you have to reduce CapEx if needed? Thank you. Mark Kempa : Hi, Jared, it\u2019s Mark. So certainly, we have flexibility to reduce certain CapEx where needed. It\u2019s always a delicate balance because, of course, you don\u2019t want to damage the brand for short-term gains. We \u2013 this is a long-term business, and it\u2019s \u2013 and we want to continue investing on that. But of course, we always have plan B and plan C should be needed. In relation to the CapEx for 2020 and 2021, the increase is primarily as a result of a couple of our new building contract becoming effective. If you look back into all of our Q filings, we had not included in our contractual commitments, shipyard payments related to the two Oceania ship vessels and the third Explorer vessel, and subsequently, over the course of the quarter, two of those contracts actually became effective wherein that we received authorization from the Italian export credit agency, and we\u2019ve been very explicit on that in all of our filings. So it\u2019s not necessarily an increase in general CapEx. It\u2019s just the fact that that our new building CapEx is coming online for effective contracts. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you. And then I guess, pre-virus, you were guiding 2% to 3% yield growth? Or that\u2019s what you\u2019re guiding, excluding the coronavirus impact given all that you\u2019ve said and all that we know in terms of 2020 was shaping up very well. Demand in wave season is really strong. You\u2019re lapping the Cuba effects. You\u2019ve got new accretive ships coming on, a lot of marketing spend, I guess, 2% to 3% yield doesn\u2019t really seem to tie to as well as the environment would have seemed to have been. So can you maybe just help me understand what went into that 2% to 3% yield growth? And any chance that you may have been somewhat conservative in that number? Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Well, it\u2019s early in the year. And I think, as we\u2019ve always said, we tend to take a \u2013 a bit of a cautious approach. Yes, bookings were doing very, very well prior to the outbreak. And we\u2019ve always said that we guide 2% to 3% on the top line. We do have Splendor, which is coming online, that will be accretive to our corporate yields. That\u2019s going to be somewhat offset by the Encore, which we\u2019ve said we think the combination of the two of those are really going to be a net neutral. And then we\u2019re rolling over some of the incremental or rolling over the annual season of Encore. So certainly, 2% to 3% is our range and outperformance on that would come from both revenue and ticket and on board. And as I said earlier, on-board has been doing very well despite what\u2019s going on in the marketplace. So I think that would have been the key variable. Jared Shojaian : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Paul Golding : Thanks for taking my question. So the first piece of the corona sort of remediation here with the Eastern Med Spirit redeployment. I was wondering if there was any more detail you could give around yield, how that might comp just as far as what\u2019s baked into the $0.75 impact? Mark Kempa : Well, I think what you\u2019re referring to is in terms of what are our expectations around the Spirit in the new market. And I think I had commented on that with Steve, is that, listen, it\u2019s a very short booking window. That is a great itinerary. We do expect to receive some pricing and load that would not be commensurate with our typical expectations, just given the short nature of the booking window. So there is a delta of what we believe that we can actually extract out of that market versus what she was planned to do, but we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to garner as much price as we can. But again, more importantly, we\u2019re starting from zero, and it\u2019s a very short window. We have to keep that in mind. Frank Del Rio : And we don\u2019t want to stray from our go-to-market strategy. And therefore, you\u2019re not going to see the kind of pricing action that would require us to have in the marketplace to fill that ship, especially with only two, three, four months runway compared to the typical 15 to 18 months runway that cruise lines give themselves to fill a failing. So it\u2019s too early to tell what the yield impact is on the differential between what the ship would have done, had she stayed in Asia under normal circumstance, what the ship would have generated in Asia had she stated under the current circumstance and what she will actually perform, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Paul Golding : Understood. And then just looking at the new terminal in Miami, is there anything that we can start to think about as far as potential tailwinds from that, anything from the dynamic with how you price cruising out of there? Anything that\u2019s not in guidance from that? Frank Del Rio : Well, look, anything we can do to make our cruises out of Miami, which is our number one port of embarkation, more attractive, I think, will certainly help attract a higher level of customers, which we\u2019re always after, because we know that those who pay the most to get on spend the most once they\u2019re on. Daniel, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Tim Conder : Frank, first of all, thank you, and we appreciate your passion, your love for zero, in particular. So I did want to reconfirm, though, that the $0.75 that is what you know as direct impact. So any of the impacts that you\u2019re seeing indirectly that\u2019s not in the $5.40 to $5.60 guidance. So there\u2019s some unknown piece of the indirect, just to reconfirm that we should anticipate there\u2019s some other number yet unquantifiable. Is that fair? Mark Kempa : Tim, that is exactly correct. It is the $0.75 is only what we know from our canceled sailings and some level of differential on the Spirit. It explicitly does not include any indirect impact from general softness in the cruise space. We just simply cannot quantify that at this point on a reasonable basis. Tim Conder : Okay. Very, very fair. Very fair. And lastly, total other question here, fuel. Mark, you gave the updated guidance for 2020, what should we anticipate the mix of your fuel? You talked about how due to IMO 2020, that\u2019s going to jump this year, just maybe update us on that number. But then how should we see as the cadence of that coming, maybe going to something normal out in 2022 or whenever may be. How do you see that progressing from the mix from 2020 to 2021 to 2022? Mark Kempa : Yes. Certainly, so mix shifted today in 2019 and prior, we were burning about 30% MGO. It went to about 60% MGO this year. And with our exhaust gas scrubber program in place, in 2021, we anticipate that it will level out somewhere around the 50%. And thereafter, all of our new builds that would come online in the following years would simply help reduce that 50%. So I would say for 2021 and 2022, it\u2019s going to be about a 50-50 mix, and then we\u2019ll see some slight decrease thereafter each year. Tim Conder : Okay. Thank you all. Frank Del Rio : Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your time. And for the most part, your informed questions. As always, we will be available to answer any other questions you have later today. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time.  As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. In the past, we have hosted our earnings calls from various locations, including London, the New York Stock Exchange and even onboard our vessels. Never have we hosted a call with our entire team scattered in different locations. It's one of the many ways we're adopting to the new environment so I ask that you bear with us as we find our sea legs on our first socially distanced earnings call. I'm therefore joined virtually today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to just cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2020 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call also includes forward-looking statements that may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone joining us today along with your loved ones and colleagues are safe and healthy. Every one of us is doing our part to combat this pandemic by sheltering in place and practicing social distancing. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank and good morning everyone. Given the swift and significant impact COVID-19 has had on our business, my remarks today will not be typical for an earnings call. I will not focus on yield growth or net cruise costs, as today these metrics simply aren't relevant. Instead, I will focus on the quick development and execution of our financial action plan and how we believe we've positioned our company to withstand an unlikely scenario of over 18 months in a zero revenue environment. Slide 7 illustrates our four-point action plan, which we quickly implemented to conserve and increase cash to protect the business. The four key areas of focus include, reducing operating expenses, reducing capital expenditures, improving our debt maturity profile and securing additional capital. First, let's focus on operating expenses on slide 8. We deployed several levers to reduce both shoreside and shipboard operating expenses. SG&A savings included the significant reduction or deferment of near-term marketing expenses, the introduction of a shortened work week with a commensurate 20% salary reduction for team members and a furlough of approximately 20% of shoreside employees through July 31. Frank Del Rio : Couldn't find the mute button, Mark. Thank you. With our ships in safe harbor and an enhanced liquidity position post our extremely successful capital raise, we now shift our focus to the third phase of our response as seen on Slide 15, executing on our road map for a new era of cruising. This phase is critical, very critical and will be predicated on two main factors : first receiving approval to safely resume operations from governments around the world including the CDC; and second and most important providing consumers with absolute confidence in our ability to deliver safe and healthy vacation environment through new and enhanced health and safety protocols utilizing the latest state-of-the-art technologies and testing methodologies. Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long-term operations and making cruising the safest option in the travel and leisure space and providing our guests with the peace of mind around their good health, while vacationing aboard our vessels. This will require a multi-pronged, multidisciplinary and multi-agency and global strategy that will involve strong collaboration between cruise lines, industry associations, national and local governments, public health agencies and ports around the world. Our goal is to preserve the traditional elements of the cruise experience, the great value, the multiple destinations visited, the wide array of dining entertainment offerings, modified as necessary as to the many changes we are becoming accustomed to in our daily lives. Another area of focus is working with our port agents and operators around the globe, to understand and coordinate plans for reopening. This endeavor will undoubtedly involve fits and starts as destinations decide when to reopen cruise ports. Overlaying these plans with possible new consumer demand trends, will guide the early days of our gradual re-launch, including which itineraries will first come online. Having assets with rudders and propellers is a unique advantage to our industry as we can be extremely nimble and reposition our ships as needed. While our operations teams focused on protocols and destination, our brand presidents will focus on reactivating and accelerating the sales and marketing machine that is at the heart of our market to fill philosophy. Our brands have done a fantastic job fostering demand in engaging guests and travel partners in this challenging operating environment with our ships sitting idle. As we prepare for sailings to resume, we will have to adapt our marketing strategy to focus on health and safety measures, while at the same time keeping sight on the overall drilling experience of cruising, and what makes it such a unique vacation experience in the travel industry. With new protocols in place, coordination with ports and demand engines churning, what follows will be a phased re-launch of voyages. We expect sailings to restart with a handful of vessels, phasing in others over a period of five to six months before we have our full fleet back in operation. As I said earlier, as with many new endeavors, there will be fits and starts that will require the quick implementation of new protocols, which we will continue to adapt as we learn what works, and as newer more efficient and more cost-effective technologies involve and become readily available. Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with a few key takeaways from slide 16. First, we have significantly strengthened our financial position to withstand a prolonged suspension of voyages by significantly reducing operational and capital expenses and executing several liquidity enhancing measures including a successful capital raise of $2.4 billion. Second, there continues to be demand for cruise vacations, despite limited marketing and demand generating investments. And lastly, we are intently focused on developing and executing the next level of health and safety protocols for a new era of cruising led by a seasoned management team that has proven its ability to navigate through uncertain and challenging times. And with that Jonathan, let's open up the call for questions please. Operator : Certainly.  Our first question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Thomas Allen : Hi. Good morning. So focusing on the future, how do you think your higher domestic source mix and your higher absolute yields will affect the way your recovery looks versus the industry in general? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Thomas, I think there's a lot of muscle memory throughout the ecosystem, and so everything is relative. I think the demand -- overall demand certainly will be impacted. It will be weaker as we roll out as the economy takes its toll, as people need to regain confidence in the cruise industry, and our ability to keep them healthy. But if we were -- if we had the highest yields coming into this, I think we'll have the highest yields during it and highest yields coming out of it. Part of it is because of our brands. Part of it is because of our fleet. Part of it is because our go-to-market strategy, as you know is not to discount to fill. It's to market to fill. So, we're very anxious to getting back to do what we do best, which is marketing. And as you know, we have literally shut down the marketing machine, the sales and marketing machine over the last 10 weeks or so. And despite that shutdown, as you've seen in our disclosures today, we're still taking bookings. And that gives us a lot of encouragement that despite everything that's going on, people still want to cruise. And I think that's the best indication we have that there is a future and the future will be bright. Thomas Allen : Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, you -- there was some encouraging comments on the prepared remarks around overall book position and pricing for 2021 being within historical ranges. How much of that is new money being booked versus re-bookings of existing mortgages? And how should we think about that? Thank you. Mark Kempa : Yeah. The vast majority of the booked position today that has us within historical ranges, and historical ranges for us means 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, the last three, four years. The vast majority is good old cash bookings. Over time as people finalize their future plans, we hope that they do take advantage of those future cruise certificates which as you know are good through the end of 2022. So, they've got plenty of time. But today the vast majority of those sailings -- of those bookings I should say, are just normal cash bookings. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess -- I know there's a lot of unknowns, but how do you think about the free cash flow generation at the ship level at various occupancy levels as you start seeing some go back out in the water and there are still different social distancing measures that could be in place? Frank Del Rio : Don't think of it as load factors. Think of it as total revenue. As you know yield total revenue's made up of three variables; load factor, ticket revenue, and onboard revenue. And so there is a relatively low total revenue threshold before that particular sailing is cash positive. But look the number one factor as we relaunch operations is not the -- necessarily the revenue of a particular sailing or the EBITDA of a particular sailing. It's regaining the confidence of the consumer so the consumer can continue to book under the normal booking curve. Remember this is a forward-looking business. The cash flows that comes from customer deposits and the advanced payments is what fuels this industry and what has been draining out of everybody's treasury over the last 10 weeks or so as we either cancel sailings or people cancel their own voyages for a myriad of reasons. So, as we start operations we've got to regain momentum, Stephen. This is an industry a company that was running 1,000 miles an hour and overnight was shut down to just a screeching halt and we've got to get that momentum back. And so I am less concerned about what the EBITDA, the revenue may be of a particular sailing especially in the first 30 or 60 to 90 days, but I'm more concerned about getting back normal operations, getting back to the sales and marketing machine, churning out which churns out the cash flow necessary to rebuild our advanced ticket sales because the important part is knowing that people book seven, eight months in advance let's not forget that. And so I'm concerned about cash inflows in the short-term as we resume operations and we'll be looking at what revenue and EBITDA will be six, seven, eight months after that in the normal course of what the booking curves are. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And as a related follow-up can you just remind us what percentage of forward bookings typically come onboard the ships? And any other color? It sounds like you're kind of going down this path, but around when working capital would potentially inflect as we think about different booking curves and ships coming back out in the water. Frank Del Rio : I'm not sure I understand the question Stephen. Mark Kempa : Yes. Stephen I think -- this is Mark. So there's two pieces to that. I think you were asking how much -- how many customers book while on board, is that correct? Stephen Grambling : Correct. Mark Kempa : Yes. So, I don't think we've disclosed that but obviously we have very solid programs under our CruiseNext program where we are able to secure forward bookings but we don't give publicly those numbers. In terms of the working capital, the way we're thinking about it is look we've one of the positive signs that we've seen is we've seen a significant inflow of new bookings and new cash, but as well as customers with existing bookings. And while we are now in the process of obviously refunding quite a few customers their advanced bookings, we believe that in the next 30 to 60 days we are going to be working capital positive as a result of the new and existing cash that's coming in from those bookings. So, you will see it. There is going to be a little bit of a slow ramp-up to that. But again in the next 30 to 60 days we see a positive working capital from that. Stephen Grambling : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Instinet. Your question please. Harry Curtis : Good morning everybody. Wanted to go back to the comments you made Frank about the importance of customer confidence. You've recently brought on Scott Gottlieb as a Consultant. Can you walk us through some of the new protocols that -- what they might look like to improve that confidence as potential customers consider cruising again and the safety aspect? Frank Del Rio : Good morning Harry. Look I don't want to run what we're going to be developing. That is up to all the experts that we have put together. We think we've put together a very strong team. So, it's first things first. The number one gain consideration today is to get the CDC to lift a no-sale order. That's job one. Can't go very far without that. And so we have to introduce a series, what I would refer to as robust and comprehensive series of protocols that gives the CDC confidence that the environment onboard a cruise ship is healthy. And then once we do that we have to communicate whatever those protocols may be to the traveling public and bring -- and give them the same confidence that we were able to instill in the CDC. So it's a multipronged process. Similar submissions to the CDC will likely have to also take place around the world. The U.S. isn't the only country concerned with the spread of COVID-19 they all are. We've seen some recent cracks in the opening if you will of what's happening in the EU. They have a more unified plan in place to gradually reopen borders and therefore tourism. So that's very helpful and encouraging. But this will take some time. We want to do this right Harry. This is not an exercise of optics. This is not an exercise of let's get away with the minimum required. I want to do everything humanly possible within the bounds of what technology offers us today to be able to look my own family in the eye and say \"You are safe to go onboard our cruise ships.\" And until we do that respective of what the CDC or anybody else might say we're not going to operate. We want to make sure that we preserve and enhance the equity value of our three brands and you're not going to do that if you have outbreaks of disease on board. So it's still too early to talk about specifics, but know that everything is on the table to make sure that we can provide that health, security and confidence among all stakeholders. Harry Curtis : Thank you for that. Maybe a quick follow-up on the comment that Mark just made about working capital positive. Can you talk about your -- the expectations of how -- when you get when you begin to market again, when you get two or three ships in the water, is that likely to lift the velocity of bookings as customers actually feel confident that they can set itineraries? And Mark maybe you can comment on how you get to maybe a 30- to 60-day narrowing of that working capital gap and whether or not just by setting those itineraries is really the primary catalyst for that? Mark Kempa : Yes. I think -- so first let me be clear that since we've shut down and I'll reference the month of April, we have taken a significant amount of new cash bookings and collected a significant amount of advanced ticket sales. And that is during a period where we had a horrific news flow and we had essentially zero marketing in the market. And that continues through May and it continues to increase. So I think you're absolutely right. To the extent when we can actually get voyages on sale and we actually start to really spend a little bit more marketing dollars, I think you're going to see that flywheel spin even quicker. But even without that and again that's what's important and why we're so confident here is that we continue to take in a significant amount of cash today. And so it is not our working capital -- my working capital comments are not dependent on us saying that we have to announce an itinerary in one month or two months or three months. That will help and that will help accelerate, but it is not dependent upon that. So again, it just continues to demonstrate with the new cash coming in the resiliency of this industry. And consumers are smart. They understand that there will be solutions. We are seeing customers come back. They're booking, obviously not to the volumes that we would like to see in a normal environment. But consumers know this product's going to be there and that they have confidence in it. So bottom line is that will help, but it is definitely not dependent on that. Harry Curtis : Well, that's a positive statement relative to the negative press that you see in the media these days. Good luck with that. Thanks. Mark Kempa : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your question please. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, thanks. Good morning and thank you for the helpful information. This is probably for both of you Frank and Mark. Just question/clarification on your booking commentary because it seems to have moved around over the past few weeks and we've just been getting a lot of questions on that. So when you filed your 8-K on April 27 and that data was as of April 17, you said the 2020 book position was meaningfully lower with pricing down low single-digits. And then that changed in a following 8-K. You said that bookings as of 4/24 were meaningfully lower, but pricing was now down mid-singles. And then for 2021 the pricing commentary didn't change but the booking commentary did so as of 4/17 your book position was flat. And then at 4/24 it was slightly lower. In both cases pricing remained down to single-digits. And then in this release there wasn't really a lot of color on the booking commentary. So just trying to get an idea overall about the trends because just based on that it seems like they're getting worse. But also like is it even meaningful, right? So like how much of an indication do you think it really gives us for pricing and bookings once cruising actually opens up? Frank Del Rio : So Felicia, as time goes on, remember we started the year in a incredibly better book position than any other time. We had a huge lead. We had a huge lead at the end of February. And as the COVID-19 pandemic has worked its way through the booking process we're taking less bookings than we were this time last year. We're still taking bookings as Mark said. It's encouraging to see how much bookings we're taking given that the entire sales and marketing apparatus is shut down that we're working virtually. The travel agents, which still make up the majority of our business is not at full strength either. But as time goes on and we take on less bookings in the current period or periods than prior year, you're going to see a deficit being built over time, as we continue to be shut down and not until we reopen all the sales and marketing activities and the travel agents reopen for business, et cetera would you see a pivotal acceleration of new business that hopefully gets us back to a rate that allows us to sail full. So over time if things continue the way they are today, over time, the commentary will be that we are falling behind to where we were this time last year because we are taking less bookings today than we did a year ago. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, that makes sense. And then just to clarify something you said earlier because you said it very fast. Just that \u2013 because we were talking about the historical booking patterns for 2021 and you're saying I think that was in terms of how much is booked in 2021 in the high teens. So I think you said 17% 18% 19%. Did I hear that right? Mark Kempa : No, I think that was a reference to say when we look at our historical trends it was based on calendar years 2017 through 2020. Frank Del Rio : Yes not a percentage. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. So \u2013 but if we look at \u2013 got you. If we look at normal historical booking patterns though just for the industry in general, I think this time this year, the following year is somewhere around 20%, 25% booked. So is that the metric when you're staying in line with historical patterns? Frank Del Rio : We won't comment as to your high-teen 25% because we typically don't comment on where our book position is for the following year at this early stage. But we are comparing where we are right now for 2021 compared to where we were right now a year ago for 2020 and compared to what we call the historical range, which includes 2017, 2018, 2019. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then just on your comment that the full fleet could return in five to six months, I was just wondering is that based on customer surveys you're doing now and the booking curve? And do you think you'll be sailing at historical occupancy levels, or does that really depend on kind of some of the regulations that will be in place? Frank Del Rio : Yes. The return to service of a phased approach of roughly five vessels per month is what we believe we operationally could handle in terms of bringing back the ship from cold lay-up including re-crewing the vessels, et cetera. And so that \u2013 given that we have 28 vessels, if you bring back an average of five vessels a month, it's going to take about six months to get all ships back operating. Now that assumes that the itineraries that these ships would operate are available for operations. And so it could be that if ship number 19 is operating a certain itinerary and that itinerary is not open or certain key ports in that itinerary are not open then maybe that that vessel has to stay late up longer periods of time. So the six-month ramp-up assumes more than anything else our operational capability to ramp up and that the ports are open has nothing to do with consumer demand because we believe consumer demand and the bookings that follow are based on our ability to market, travel agents being back open again, the whole industry being back in operation as opposed to sitting idle, et cetera. Felicia Hendrix : And on the occupancy side do you think you'll be sailing at regular occupancy levels? Frank Del Rio : No I don't think so one bit. I think it'll take time to ramp up loads. We don't know for example, whether government agencies will require us to initially sail at less than 100%, even if there was demand to sail 100%. Just remember, the -- it's very easy and incurred very quickly to dismantle the whole apparatus. And that it takes time to refill the apparatus. So if the booking curved on average is seven to eight months, it's going to take at least that long, without taking in consideration economic factors of how it may have affected the consumer, to get the pipeline back to a full or near-full environment. And so, this is going to take time. All we can do now is use some level of reasonable projections. But until we get back in the game and recognize that being back in the game could be different than it was before, for the reasons I noted before, what are the protocols that we will have to operate by, what ports are open et cetera, those are the biggest gating factors, not necessarily consumer demand. I believe that consumer demand in this industry and this -- these three brands of ours are very apt, at marketing. The travel agents are well behind us. There is pent-up demand let's not forget that. People only talk about the negative, but the fact that the industry has been shutdown now over four months. There'll be pent-up demand. People will want to cruise again. And so, all those are positive factors. But nothing takes the place of time. And we have to be conscious of that. Felicia Hendrix : Thank you so much. That is very helpful. Operator : Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial. Your question please. I think you might have your phone on mute. Ivan Feinseth : Yes. Sorry about that. And thanks for taking my question. I have just two quick questions. Were you able to take advantage of the drop in oil that we saw in April? Because you had a slide in the appendix, shows oil prices just at the end of March. And my other question is, the people who are booking are they booking -- are you getting bookings from people who are within driving distance to the ship they're booking on, or are you still -- are you seeing people who are booking also going to fly to get to the port -- the ship that they're booking on? Frank Del Rio : I'll take your second question. And Mark will answer your question about fuel. I thought somebody would ask me this type of question, so I looked into it. For the Ocean and Regent brand, their number one itinerary in terms of demand for Q1 early Q2 is Japan, its Dubai, several of the World Cruise segment. So therefore you have to fly there. And so, this notion that people aren't going to want to cruise to faraway places or exotic destinations, what we're seeing, is defying that. So we're not seeing any particular area of strength other than these Japanese itineraries, these World Cruise segments that are sold out literally. No particular destination is performing particularly well or particularly bad. People are booking and people are cancelling sailings in the future, at the pro rata rate that we have those itineraries available either. I'll let Mark answer the question about fuel. Mark Kempa : Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Ivan. So, yeah, we did take advantage of some of the recent fuel pricing and opportunistically layered on some hedges for 2022 and 2023. We didn't do anything for the remainder of 2020 obviously, because we're already 68% hedged for the back half of the year. And really the big question is that when are we going to be able to restart. So we didn't want to do anything there. And we continue to look at 2021. So we -- now that we have our capital rate behind us. We will continue to focus on that. And again, from an opportunistic standpoint, where it makes sense we will enter that market. Ivan Feinseth : Just one other quick question, in the fact that some of your -- like Regent Cruises include plane tickets. And you have had promotions in the past that include airfare. Do you think there's an opportunity to work with the airlines who unfortunately like your industry have been unfairly hurt by this to get a deal on plane tickets that you could help market in the future to people who want -- who cruise. But don't live close to the ports? Frank Del Rio : We definitely believe that airfares in the near to -- in the next six to 12 months will be lower than usual. So it will be a tailwind to cost. And we'll look to do more and more promotions including air, on itineraries that require that yes. Ivan Feinseth : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour from JPMorgan. Your question please. Brandt Montour : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. Based on the internal scenarios that you're running for load and for price and assuming you can't start sailing in August, roughly how much of your fleet, do you think needs to be in the water to break even on an EBITDA basis? Mark Kempa : Yeah. So -- good morning, Brent. This is Mark. So again I think there's two ways to think about this right? In terms of -- if you look at our historical EBITDA margins, they're about 30% so that kind of gives you upwards of 30%. That kind of gives you how much -- whether it's revenue or a combination of costs we can reduce and you could translate that into a percentage of fleet. But then it depends on whether or not the ships are full or operating at reduced load. But as Frank had said earlier, our concern right now is not are we operating in a positive EBITDA or a negative EBITDA? We are -- we need to gain momentum. We need to get ships in the water to accelerate the product awareness and get that ATS cash flywheel going again. And that's what we're focused on for the next six to eight months. So there's not a magic number of ships, because there's just too many dynamics between the pricing and the load and then what the spend is. So I will tell you that we -- obviously, we don't want to run the business at a loss but we will have to run the business at a loss for the next few months, but it's more importantly about getting that cash flywheel going again, so. Brandt Montour : That was good. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck. Mark Kempa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your question please. Steve Wieczynski : Yeah. Hi, guys, good morning. Mark, let me ask the working capital question a little bit differently and I hope this makes sense. But you guys have indicated this morning that -- I don't remember, which adjective you used but a good bit of the 2021 bookings are new or unique bookings. So after the first wave of refunds that have already occurred, is it fair to say that for every dollar you are refunding now, you're bringing in a new dollar for an advanced booking, or is that ratio still tilted way more toward a net cash outflow? Mark Kempa : Yeah. I would say looking at it today there's still -- it is still definitely weighted towards a net cash outflow. And what I was referring to earlier is that when we look over the course of the next 60 days, by the end of that 60-day period we believe that ratio would flip to a positive. And that's just a matter of timing and again given the amount of refunds that we are implementing as a result of the canceled voyages. So again that's -- I would -- we anticipate in the next 60 days that that is a positive ratio. But I will tell you again it's very encouraging that we are substantially offsetting those refunds with that new cash coming in and that's where we definitely see some of the green shoots of this industry. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, got you. And then second question, I think it might be for Frank or you Mark. But I assume you guys have run all kinds of scenarios as to what the business looks like as it comes back online. And can help us think about the time lines you guys are projecting or expecting that we might be looking at in order for you guys to return to some kind of profitability level whether that's a 2019 level or whether that's a 2018 level? Anything like that would be pretty helpful as well. Frank Del Rio : So let's start with 2020. 2020 is a wasted year. At a minimum, the industry is going to go the entire Q2 without a penny of revenue, impossible to overcome. Depending on how quickly we can reopen and whether in our case, for example, can we execute on the plan that I laid out where we bring back the fleet gradually over a six-month period. So pick a date. But just for argument's sake, pick October 1st as the first start date and I only pick October 1st, don't read much more into what except that it's beginning of a quarter. And you figure that we won't be fully operational until the end of Q1 of 2021. And during that time you are ramping up your marketing, travel agents hopefully around the world, especially in the U.S. coming back to work. The booking curve traditionally is seven, eight months. You put all those factors to work and what you end up with is a very challenging period of time through Q1, getting better in Q2, every subsequent sequential quarter is better whether you get back to full operation, full load factor, full pricing, sometime in 2022 I personally don't believe. I think the runway will be longer. But 2021 will be a transition year. And then you can start the rebuilding in earnest in 2022 forward. And whether you get back to 2019 levels in late 2022 or in 2023 and if you're really pessimistic in 2024 there's so many details involved. Steve, I know you know this the things we normally talk about are out the door. We're talking about just -- it's almost like relaunching a company from scratch, when you have the entire fleet shut down and you don't know when you're going to be able to start again because it's not up to you. It's up to public health officials and governments around the world. It's very difficult to predict with certainty revenue and EBITDA. As I said before, it's a building block. And the building block starts with when can we start to operate? When can we start marketing? Marketing is the seat of cash. Cash comes in six, seven, eight months later, that cash can be recognized as revenue and therefore then EBITDA. So we got to have patience. It took decades to build this industry. And in a matter of weeks we dismantled it and it's going to take not decades to build it up again, but it's going to take a little time. And we just have to be patient. No one is more impatient than me. But I recognize that this is going to be a recovery effort that's going to take multiple quarters, perhaps multiple years to get back to the good old days of 2019. Steve Wieczynski : That\u2019s great. Thanks, Frank. Great color. Frank Del Rio : We have time operator, Jonathan for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question then for today comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Your question please. Vince Ciepiel : Yes, thanks. So, it sounds like your plan is, if things go right maybe five to six months of reactivation and reactivating the full 100% of your fleet. I know you have a bit relatively younger age in your fleet versus the industry. But could you comment on what percent if at all do you think the industry may lay up or retire or scrap through this pandemic? Frank Del Rio : Yes. I can't speak for the industry at large with any kind of specifics. As you pointed out, we have a very young fleet, so none of our vessels are remotely eligible if you will for scrapping or for anything else. I do believe in a macro environment given what we are facing that you're going to find that certain vessels will be retired vessels that might have been marginal performers in good times may not be worthy so to speak of staying in service. So, you might see that. You might see new delivery. I remember all you guys being so worried about capacity increases and over the last couple of years that it was 5% or 6% and it was a couple of points higher than the historical average. And oh my God, oh my God and you saw how the industry was able to easily digest new capacity coming online and we all had the best years of our history. But I do believe that certain vessels that may be scheduled for delivery in the next 12 to 18 months may be delayed and that will help the capacity situation. And different companies will have different plans on how to bring back their fleets. One of the things that I've been telling folks that I usually don't say is that, I'm glad I only have 28 ships. Usually I want more ships. That's why we have nine vessels on order because, when you have what you have and they're all full and you're making lots of money with them you want more vessels. But in this environment, I'm glad I have less vessels. So, look, like in many industries that are facing the kind of challenges we're facing there's going to be survivors and there's going to be some that don't survive and there's going to be success stories and failures. We think we're in very, very good position given our liquidity profile, given the quality of our assets, our go-to-market strategy, our management team. So, we feel like we will be one of the success stories that will write the history books on COVID-19. We'll see where the chips fall for everybody else. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, operator. I look forward to our next call in 90 days or so. Things will I'm sure will be very, very different. I hope they're different for the best. In the meantime, I hope you all stay healthy and continue fighting the good fight. Thank you very much. Mark Kempa : Thank you, very much everybody. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michelle and I will be your operator. . I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm joined today virtually by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. Frank Del Rio : Mark Kempa : Did we lose Frank? Frank Del Rio : I'm sorry, I had you on mute. I will begin from the top. Thank you, Andrea, and good morning. I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones are healthy and safe. Similar to our previous earnings call in May, today, we will provide a business update on the progress of our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic. I'd like to start off by putting the current no-sail situation into perspective. In the last 5 months, our company and the cruise industry at large has experienced more adversity than at any other time in our 50-plus-year history. The negative effect the cruise industry faces from the COVID crisis eclipses that of 9/11, the Great Recession and any other stress test scenario that once imagination has ever modeled combined. Looking back, it would have been unimaginable for us to foresee that today, 5 months after the initial suspension of service, which was declared on March 13, that our entire 28-ship fleet would still be at a complete standstill. Motor anchored in ports around the world waiting to set sail again. We are experiencing about the pandemic is unprecedented and extreme and uncertain and will surely be chronicled as those extraordinary events in our sailing history. Nevertheless, I continue to remain confident and upbeat that we will once again demonstrate our resilience and adapt to the complex and ever-changing COVID-19 environment. There is always a silver lining in all hardships, and as you know, our company is nimble and innovative, and we will find ways to meet the needs of the current environment, no matter what they may be. Whether that's developing and implementing new and innovative health and safety protocols, developing new or modified itinerary or changes to the onboard experience, understanding consumer trends or any other obstacles that come our way, we will look back on 2020 and this pandemic and, once again, witness the evolution it will bring not just to the cruise and hospitality space, but to all aspects of life and society around the world. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Given the rapid and significant impact COVID-19 has had on our business, my remarks will focus on the continued execution of our financial action plan and how we believe we have positioned our company to weather an extended period of voyage suspensions. The global pandemic has lasted longer than anticipated, resulting in the continued suspension of our cruise voyages, which have now been extended through October 31. There is still much uncertainty around how the pandemic will evolve so we will have to continue to adapt and modify our strategy in real time. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. We have taken important initial steps on our road map to relaunch, which is illustrated on Slide 11, particularly in the first phase, which is the enhancement of health and safety protocols. Nothing is more important than the sustained restart of cruise operations than the implementation of health and safety protocols that protect those onboard our vessels and provide guests with greater confidence in our ability to deliver a safe and healthy vacation environment. Our company and the cruise industry added another tool in our toolbox for developing these enhanced protocols with the formation of the Healthy Sail Panel, a collaboration with our industry peer, Royal Caribbean Group. While we compete fiercely on everything having to do with business, we do not compete on health and safety issues. At the end of the day, the entire industry has one goal in common. And that is to create an environment that mitigates the risk of COVID-19. The panel is tasked with providing recommendations to advance our public health response to COVID-19 and inform us on the development of a science-backed plan for a safe and healthy return to cruising. We have incredible players on the panel, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Governor, Mike Leavitt, former Secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services. The co-chairs jointly recruited and rounded out the panel with an impressive group of globally recognized experts with diverse backgrounds, including in public health, infectious disease, biosecurity, hospitality and marine operations, as is shown on Slide 12. The vast experience and breadth of knowledge of the panel's members make them uniquely suited to inform us as we develop the next generation of cruise health and safety standards, while at the same time enabling us to preserve as much as possible what makes the cruise experience so special, so  and so successful. Bringing aboard these respective experts demonstrates our absolute commitment to the common goal of combating the spread of COVID-19 and bringing back the cruise industry operations sooner rather than later. In an effort to make broader contribution to global public health, the panel's work will also be open source and can be freely adopted by any company or industry that would benefit from the group's scientific medical insights. Given cruising is unique in that it encompasses several experiences in one vacation, that being lodging, dining, entertainment and, of course, transportation, we believe the process and structure we've come up with could be a best-in-class effort and a model for how other industries can work through this public health challenge. The panel has been hard at work developing its initial recommendations for the resumption of cruising, which our operations team will then incorporate into specific and detailed plans to submit to the U.S. CDC and other public health and maritime agencies across the globe. In addition to their initial recommendations, the panel will continue researching other cutting-edge health and safety technologies and innovation that could further benefit the cruise industry, but which may take more time to implement. So will there be changes? Yes, there will be. But as I mentioned earlier, adaptability and innovation are 2 characteristics in which our company and our industry excels. So while we do expect cruising to be different in the future, at least until such time as the COVID-19 crisis is no longer a threat to public health, we are confident the work of these changes, while being mindful as to how those changes may impact guest satisfaction, the overall cruise experience. If you think about cruising 10, 15, 20 years ago, the experience was different than it is today. Think of how we've introduced freestyle cruising and then how much has changed since then, with innovations such as our groundbreaking electric Go-Kart race tracks and Galaxy Pavilion. To guarantee you that 5 to 10 years from today, things will also be different. A concurrent step in our road map is to determine port availability, both for home porting and for ports of call. Conversations continue with key destinations regarding the reopening of ports and the resumption of calls. The key theme in these conversations is naturally the enhanced health and safety protocols as destinations look to cruise lines and public health officials to develop and approve these new procedures. This step is critical as it will allow for destinations to prepare their ports, their terminals, crew operations and other considerations for these new procedures. In certain parts of the world where the spread of virus has lessened, cruising has taken a critical first step in resuming operation. Regional operators are sailing both large and expedition size ships once again, albeit with reduced capacity and limited to guests from their home countries. Recent events demonstrate that with the resumption of sailings, just as with the reopening of any other sector of the economy or of society, fits and starts are to be expected. In just like carriers of the economy, such as air travel, hotels, restaurants, shopping centers and the like, cruise operators will learn from these initial setbacks and adapt protocols to provide even a safer vacation experience. Our industry has an unparalleled history of successfully implementing regulations, which gives us the confidence that we will successfully adapt to this challenge as well. The third step in our road map is the revving up of our marketing engine. My earlier commentary outlined our current strategy in terms of the quantum and direction of our marketing investments. There is certainty around the timing of the resumption of sailings, a milestone that is entirely dependent on obtaining the approval to sail from government agencies, such as the CDC, we can augment our marketing and demand generation investments and do what we do best, execute on our go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill, which leads to our industry-leading yields. Lastly, comes the gradual sailing and relaunch of our ships, first with the launch of a handful of vessels, likely at some reduced occupancy level, followed by the gradual addition of the rest of our fleet, which we continue to estimate will take at least 6 months to complete. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with a few key takeaways that are shown on Slide 13. We continue to execute on our financial action plan to reduce expenses, conserve cash and opportunistically tap the capital markets to further strengthen our financial position and enhance our liquidity runway. We continue to observe strong demand for cruising across all source and sailing regions and brands in the medium to longer term. And lastly, we are focused on our road map to relaunch as we work alongside our Healthy Sail Panel and global public health authorities to resume sailing. And with that, Michelle, please open the call to questions. Thank you. Operator :  . Our first question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So Mark, I want to go back, and I don't know if I picked this up right, but when you talked about the ship operating expenses and what you need to in terms of revenue to cover those, did I hear this right? So an individual ship, you're basically saying that's 40% of net revenue, and then to cover your corporate overhead, it would be 60% of typical net revenue levels. Is that kind of -- based on what I missed is, is that kind of pre-COVID levels? Is that 2019? That's what I'm a little bit confused about. Mark Kempa : Yes. Steve, yes, you're absolutely right. So when you look at the ships from just the ship operating expenses, based on our, let's call it, 2019 or 2020 planned levels, we would need about 40% of our typical revenue to cover the vessel operating expenses. When you layer on your corporate overhead into that, that goes up to about 60%. So keep in mind, that's an average. That's a blend. Obviously, certain ships, it might be lower than that and certain ships that may be higher than that. But generally speaking, it's about that 40% and 60%. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, got you. And then Frank, probably a bigger picture question for you. It's really about the long-term health of your -- the distribution network. And what I mean by that is, it seems there's a lot of smaller or mom-and-pop agencies might be -- are going to be forced to kind of shut their doors, if they haven't already. So I guess the question is, how do you see the travel agent network really looking over the next 5 or 10 years? And could this potentially force the hand of customers to start booking a little bit more direct with you guys? Frank Del Rio : Look, it could happen. We've seen smaller mom-and-pop types travel agents already folding their tents, even larger travel agent distributors furloughing employees, no different than the cruise lines are furloughing employees. You have to adjust to the current volume. We have seen an uptick in our direct business, more business coming in through our website and other direct channels. We think that might be exaggerated at the given time, given the -- at least partial closure of the travel agency distribution system. But I believe that travel agents will survive this, just like we will. There will always be casualties. There's been casualties so far in the cruise space. So I think on the margins of at least the short term when sailings resume, you might see a disproportionate of business coming through direct channels versus where we were seeing prior to the crisis. But I think over the long term, the travel agents have shown their resilience over the years. They've adapted to technology. It wasn't too long ago that many people predicted the demise of travel agents. And if anything, over the years, they've gone stronger. So maybe around the margins at the beginning, at the outset of the restart, but I think longer term, you're not going to see much change. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Can I squeeze 1 more quick 1 in for you, Frank? And you obviously have the youngest fleet in the industry. And I think you only have a handful of ships over 20 years old. But you've seen some of your competitors start to retire or scrap ships. And do you start thinking about taking similar actions or do you just continue to believe you need more capacity over time and you really remain underrepresented in certain markets? Frank Del Rio : Yes, Steve, you answered the question beautifully. We have a young fleet. In fact, the oldest vessel we have, prior to the pandemic, we completed the work in mid-February. We invested $150 million in the Norwegian Spirit so that ship is better than you. We love our capacity. We are the smallest of the big 3. So we're always wanting more, although I think you've heard me say that during this pandemic, I'm glad I am the smallest because there's less mouths to feed, so to speak. But look, we not only have the youngest fleet, but we also have 9 incredible vessels on order, which allows us to have the fastest-growing fleet. And so no, we absolutely have no plans to divest of any of our vessels. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Frank and Mark, you've given us tremendous information with the limited stuff that we know right now. Frank, just wondering what inning do you think you are in with the CDC in terms of having the protocols in place for both crew and passengers to sail safely. And as you know, there's unfortunately been several lines recently that have tried to sail and have had issues with COVID. So do you view that as a setback at all? Frank Del Rio : Yes. Look, there's no way to spin the initial reemergence of COVID onboard vessels. But it's like, I said in my prepared remarks, it's an opportunity to learn from them. This virus teaches us something every day. And so while it's disappointing, I'm glad that the ports that the cruise company that suffered these setbacks have handled the situation very, very well. We haven't had a repeat of what happened earlier during the pandemic crisis. And in terms of where we stand with the CDC, look, I think the next 60 to 90 days are going to be very, very key. As you know, the CDC requested an RFI, request for information, that's due through September '21. I'm told that there are thousands of comments that have already been received by the CDC. Around the same time, our panel is going to be completing at least their first initial set of recommendations, which we, along with Royal, will look to implement in our return to sail protocols that we will submit about the same time as the RFI. And so the CDC will have a lot of information to comb through and digest and opine on, let's say, beginning in Q4. And so we'll see how they react to it. We're confident that our -- the panel is going to come up with key science-based recommendations that the cruise industry can implement. That should be impressive to the cruise industry -- to the CDC. And then there's the hope that during the same time, the prevalence of the pandemic will subside to more manageable levels, and that the combination of the 2 will lead to a speedy return to service. Felicia Hendrix : And just, Mark, on your balance sheet, just can you remind us, do you have any more capacity or do you have any secured debt capacity? And then are there any practical limitations on how much in unsecured or convertible debt you could issue? Mark Kempa : Yes. From a secured standpoint, Felicia, we are pretty -- we are at our capacity, given some of the negative covenants we have on our 3.6% notes. But we do believe there is -- we do have additional capacity on an unsecured basis and -- as well as through additional convertibles and common. And so we are in active discussions with our various investment banks and always looking at additional options, should we need to do so. But we do have additional options available should we need it. But given where we stand today, we feel like we're in a good position. But it's really going to be about time, and time is the enemy here in this case. But we will continue to evaluate all options that we have. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with JPMorgan. Brandt Montour : So just going back to Frank's comments on the delta widening between the booking pace and the cumulative book position, I mean, that makes sense to us. I think it's just mass. But I guess, if you are able to turn marketing back on and you are able to start drumming up demand, can you give us a sense for -- if you're sailing in earnest in the 2Q, at what point would we start to see that delta begin to close again? Frank Del Rio : It begins to close once we discharge our full arsenal of marketing initiatives and marketing spend. Our base -- the market philosophy is market to spend, not taking no longer, the type of thing. And so we don't like discounting. We have not discounted. And the good news is that I think your analysis has indicated, for the most part, the industry-wide has not been  FCC adjusted basis, our yields in '21 are relatively flat to where they were for 2020. And as you know, 2020 was tracking to be a record year before the pandemic hit. So on the pricing side, we're holding our own very well. And again, given the limited marketing spend, I'm astonished how well bookings are coming in, given the fact that the industry is suspended. There is not a lot of positive news flow. And going forward, cruise lines now -- have now suspended sailings through October 31, and in some cases through the end of the year. So I do believe that we, in the cruise industry, enjoy a very loyal customer base. Across our 3 brands, over 50% of our guests on any given cruise are repeaters. We're going to lean on them heavily. They're going to lean on us. They want to cruise again. Depending on when you think the restart is, there's going to be 15 million, 20 million people who were not allowed to cruise this year. And there's a lot of pent-up demand there. So I can't give you a specific date when we think that the booking window  to normal. It will take some time. But we've seen one of the basic business tenets of the cruise industry is you sail full and you do what you have to do to sail full. And in our case, we market to fill. And we think that's the best strategy. It's proven its time -- its mettle time and time again. It's proving itself now. So I can't give you a specific date, but I don't think it will take that long. Brandt Montour : And I appreciate that adjusted net yield and pricing bit of information you gave us there. As you look to other industry participants as we start to get into the prime booking season for 2Q and '21 and beyond, are you seeing anyone else get more promotional with pricing? Frank Del Rio : Really haven't. As I said, there's always pockets. There's always a sailing here or there. But I'm very happy to see the discipline that the industry has shown across the board in this pandemic. I think logic tells you that business is soft not because of business fundamentals, business is soft because you can opt  and in spite of that, business is relatively strong. If you had told me that we were going to be facing these set of circumstances, and your question is, \"Frank, would you be taking any bookings?\" I would have laughed at you. I'll say, \"Of course, not, who would book? It's crazy.\" But people are booking. People are confident that we're going to come back. People do want to cruise. They miss it. It's a heck of a vacation experience, a heck of a vacation value. And so this is temporary. The question is how temporary is temporary. But it is temporary. And those who have the wherewithal, the financial wherewithal to stay in the game will reap the rewards later on. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : I wanted to focus a little bit on kind of your exposure to U.S. source. And as you think about starting up sailings in key markets for you, what have you seen over time in terms of guest willingness to maybe switch over itineraries that you're not rolling the whole fleet out at once, you're going a handful of ships by month? What have you seen over time about how willing guests are to switch ships? Frank Del Rio : Well, it all depends on the extreme -- on how the switch occurs. If, for example, we're talking about Q1 in which the vast majority of the fleet is Caribbean-centric and you stand up a handful of ships in the Caribbean but not all, moving from a ship that is not being stand up to those that are, is a relatively easy phenomenon. It's more complicated if you're asking someone who booked a 4-day cruise to the Bahama to take a 12-day cruise to Europe. So a lot depends on the start dates, what we're talking about. For example, in Alaska, we have 4 vessels in Alaska. And so it's, again, relatively easy to move people within a region within an itinerary from, let's say, Norwegian Joy and Norwegian Bliss, that they're both operating 7-day cruises in Alaska. The only difference is one departs on a Saturday and one departs on a Sunday. But over time, we've seen that customers are willing to make those kinds of changes. You may have to sweeten the pot with a shipboard credit or a cabin upgrade or something like that to induce some. But generally speaking, not an overwhelming obstacle. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And then I wanted to circle back on the 60% in the breakeven. And not to get too into the weeds here, but the -- did you mention that, that would cover the pre-crisis 2020 overhead? And haven't you made changes to that as you flex down costs, some of which I think would maybe continue into 2021? And then on top of that, you've talked about the chance that pricing is holding up well because demand has been exceeding supply of available sailings for next year and the potential for that, the potential for not having the market as much. So in your analysis, have you factored that into kind of the margin and the breakeven levels? Mark Kempa : Yes, Vince, this is Mark. So look, what we tried to do is 2020 is fluctuating so much, and you're absolutely right that we have lowered our cost base. In fact, we've lowered our operating expenses a little more than 60%. But what we tried to do to give everybody a solid foundation in which to measure that was really provided on either a 2019 or 2020 expectations, just to give it a consistent base. So -- but you are absolutely right. As we continue to flex down, that should improve with our lower cost structure. But keep in mind, this is a relatively fixed cost business for the most part. So there will be some opportunities, but that was really the basis for providing it on those levels. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial. Ivan Feinseth : First, in the bookings that you're getting, are you seeing any surprise trends? For example, are you seeing more large families booking multiple cabins or any certain trends that pop up from zip codes? Are more people who are booking coming from drivable locations to the ports or are they flying? Is there anything that's positively surprising you? And then second, are -- do you -- are you able to work with airlines to create some kind of package promotion to take advantage of the -- of an opportunity there? Frank Del Rio : So in terms of the airlines, they've lowered their rates substantially from their normal level. So they're good pricing and, hopefully, consumers will take advantage of it. Your first question is, I think, the more important one, and I mentioned that in my script. We've not seen any major shift in consumer behavior. We have not altered our itinerary. So the same itineraries that were available for purchase before the pandemic for 2021, for example, are still available today. So that means by definition, that . If they are showing favoritism to close-to-home cruising or not cruising to Asia or avoiding Europe, we're not seeing it because our itineraries have not changed. And as our booking volumes are still relatively strong, given the marketing spend and the pricing is strong, we believe that our itineraries are still attractive to our customers. We are very proud of our itineraries. As you heard me say before, itineraries is the #1 driver of yields. We lead the industry in yields by a very wide margin, which tells me that our itineraries are very well received. And so as you know, there are travel restrictions just about everywhere today. And until those begin to get lifted, we really won't see whether customers favor one versus another. Operator : . Our next question does come from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Timothy Conder : Frank, Mark and everyone, first of all, congrats on doing basically everything you can in an ongoing fluid difficult situation. To circle back to kind of a state of what maybe a new normal could be, and again, I know this is probably very highly speculative even on your part, what type of occupancies do you think would be reasonable? Let's just say, it'd be at the end of Q2 before you get the fleet back in full service. What type of occupancy would you guesstimate may be reasonable either at that point or for '21 as a whole? And then also the -- returning to the structural cost question, how should we -- once we get back to the new normal, how much of the cost, both on the ship side and then on the shoreside, would you anticipate at this point to be more structural? Frank Del Rio : I'll classify it. In terms of load factors, there's going to be so many variables. And I know you prefaced your question with -- it's highly speculative, and you're right. But I -- my instinct and it's no more than my instinct, my 25-plus years in this business peppered with a little bit of  really perhaps reading between the lines of  the government authorities, somewhere in the 75% range for full year of sailing. And my guess is it will be gradual, like everything else, it might start at 50%, 60%. I think some of the cruise companies that have already begun cruising are adaptable, and it will . With the limitation being more concerned for the spread of COVID than constraints on consumer demand, I think consumer demand will be there. I think we're all sick and tired of being cooped up in the house and we want to get out. And as long as we can ask to retain it, cruising is a safe viable vacation alternative. You're going to find customers coming back in roads. With that, I'll leave it to Mark on the cost. Mark Kempa : Yes, Tim. So I think when you look at the cost structure, we certainly are learning as we go along that maybe there is levers we can look at. So from a ship-side standpoint, I wouldn't anticipate any significant changes in our ship operating expenses. Yes, may we have some incremental costs here and there as a result of new health or safety measures. But I think on the margin, that's going to be pretty minimal. When we look at our overhead structure, one of the interesting things we've learned that, as Frank mentioned, is we've really cut back our marketing spend and yet we continue to see relatively strong bookings. So we're going to learn from that and we're going to figure out, is there a better way to spend and more and get more for that dollar? That said, our strategy is market to fill. So we will continue along that strategy. But if we can find ways to become more efficient, we certainly will do that. And as we start sailing and as the business starts to ramp back up, we're going to be prudent in terms of adding back to our overhead. We have always run a relatively lean organization. But we will continue to try and err on the side of being lean until we get back to normalized levels. So... Timothy Conder : Okay. And just to clarify, Frank, you -- just to make sure I heard you right, you would guesstimate that 75%, that would kind of be an exit run rate for '21 or the back half of '21? And then Mark, to your point, would we benchmark off of '18, '19 being lower than those levels, sort of like on a per diem basis? Mark Kempa : Yes. I think... Frank Del Rio : Go ahead, Mark. Mark Kempa : Yes, I think when you look at '18 or '19, off those levels, the 1 piece you're really going to have to look at is what did we spend in marketing in those years? Because look, we've always said, on a net cruise cost basis, our costs are pretty normal. And when we do have fluctuations in our net cruise, we've always said it typically comes from marketing. And when we've spent that marketing, we've also garnered that significant yield uplift as well. So it's been accretive to the bottom line.  So I think when you're looking at that, try to figure out how to isolate that in the background, but I think '18 or '19 levels is reasonable when you take out some of the hurricane and storm noise from those years. And Cuba as well. Don't forget, we had some increased costs in '19. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. Frederick Wightman : It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Last quarter, so back in mid-May, you talked about being in a positive working capital position within 30 to 60 days. We've obviously seen the restart date pushed back a few times since then. Just wondering if you could give an update on where that stands today, and if it's really just a matter of getting ships back into the water. If there's something else we should be tracking? Mark Kempa : Fred, it's Mark. So yes, I will say, on our last call, I think we were a little bit more hopeful than it panned out. A couple of things : number one, at that point, voyages were only suspended through June 30, and now we've added -- we're now suspended through October 31. So that's, obviously, put more pressure on our advanced ticket sale refunds that have been in the queue. So we did not -- we were not working capital positive in the quarter. Although when you look at the numbers, we were only roughly $100 million deficit. I think as we go forward, the biggest piece of our working capital is that ATS. And from an outflow standpoint, there's really not much more that we -- and from a cash standpoint, that we would have to refund. We have about $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion of ATS on the books as of the quarter, and roughly $800 million of that is in the form of future cruise certificates. So when you think about that, there's not a lot of cash outflow. And so from the inflow standpoint, we continue to take new bookings. We continue to collect deposit and final payments from customers. All the customers that we've referenced that are booking in 2021, they continue to deposit funds. So we would anticipate looking toward the tail end of the third quarter, fourth quarter being breakeven or positive on a working capital standpoint. Frank Del Rio : Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Tough environment.  we've a good liquidity runway to see this through and are hopeful that things will begin to improve, both on the prevalence of the COVID case and our ability to put together a comprehensive and robust set of protocols that gets us back in service quick. So we look forward to speaking to you again, I guess, in late October, early November. And please stay healthy and safe. All the best. Bye-bye. Mark Kempa : Thank you. Bye, bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Crystal, and I will be your operator. . I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions.  As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make references to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2020 results was issued last night and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release.  Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and the presentation.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea. And good morning. I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones are healthy and safe. Similar to our last earnings call, today, we will provide a business update, focusing more on the progress of our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, then onto financial results.  I'd like to begin by saying that we welcome the issuance of the CDC's Framework for Conditional Sailing Order. We view this as a positive step in the right direction on the path of our shared goal of resuming cruising in the United States in a safe and responsible manner.  The return to cruising is a much anticipated event for our loyal past guests, valued travel partners, our team members in the communities we visit around the globe, but in particular, by our home ports around the United States. These ports and the entire cruise ecosystem, which includes port employees, luggage handlers, stevedores, tour operators, taxi and rideshare drivers, coach operators, suppliers, airlines, hotels and many other businesses and industries have experienced significant economic hardship due to the ongoing suspension of cruising, and I am sure that they are anxiously awaiting the resumption of cruising as much as we are. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everybody. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan and our road map to relaunch as we prepare for the resumption of cruising. The global pandemic continues to have a significant impact on our business, with cruise voyages now suspended through the end of 2020. There is still much uncertainty around how the pandemic will evolve, so we are focused on what we can control and are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy in real time.  As part of our action plan, we continue to take proactive measures to conserve cash and enhance our liquidity profile. Slide 8 illustrates some of the additional initiatives taken since the beginning of the third quarter. These include further reducing operating expenses, including shoreside, general and administrative expenses; opportunistically executing on the July capital raise transactions to further bolster our liquidity profile; and refinancing our short-term $675 million revolving credit facility, which extended maturity from early 2022 to 2026.  Slide 9 outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile in response to the crisis, which we accomplished through numerous initiatives, including capital markets transactions, the deferral of amortization payments and the extension of maturities. The support we continue to receive from the export credit agencies, our commercial lenders and the shipyards has been incredible, and we cannot thank them enough for their ongoing partnership with us during this challenging time.  During the quarter, we successfully executed a triple-tranche capital raise of approximately $1.5 billion comprised of senior secured notes, exchangeable notes and ordinary shares. To date, we've raised nearly $4 billion since March and increased our cash position by nearly $5 billion with the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early in the year, providing us with a solid liquidity foundation.  We truly appreciate the support we've received from all of our investors. Thank you for believing in our business model and our management team and in the long-term potential of our company and of the industry. Turning to liquidity. Slide 10 provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of September 30 was approximately $2.3 billion on a pro forma basis, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable as of quarter end. We have also earmarked approximately $300 million to account for anticipated health and safety investments and other related items. Our health and safety investments may change as we finalize requirements in the CDC Conditional Order and as we continuously improve and refine our protocols with the best available science and technology. All of these factors combined result in a pro forma available liquidity of approximately $2 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this environment and execute on our return to service plan. Once we have additional certainty around our voyage resumption schedule, we expect bookings to accelerate, which restarts the cash flywheel and further improves our liquidity profile. We have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn, with the Q3 average monthly rate coming in at approximately $150 million, representing an over 60% reduction in net cruise cost versus normalized levels. Our entire organization has worked tirelessly to pare back expenses, while at the same time balancing the need to be ready to reactivate quickly when the time comes to resume cruise operations. For comparative purposes, if all of our vessels remained in their layup status at minimum manning levels and did not begin preparations for a return to service, we would expect fourth quarter monthly cash burn to average approximately $175 million. This is slightly higher than the third quarter, driven primarily by the timing of certain cash interest expense payments that are expected to be approximately $120 million incrementally higher in the fourth quarter.  Overall for the second half of 2020, this would result in an average monthly cash burn rate of approximately $160 million, which is in line with the company's previously disclosed target rate during a voyage suspension period. However, due to the fluidity of the voyage resumption schedule and associated expenses, our actual cash burn rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be higher. As we begin to prepare our fleet for the gradual resumption of operations, our cash burn will increase from the voyage suspension levels as a result of the following : additional disciplined demand-generating marketing investments which drive new bookings and associated cash inflows, the restaffing and repositioning of our vessels, the provisioning of our ships, and of course, the new health and safety investments that we plan to make.  Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our resumptions, we are not yet prepared to give guidance for 2021 capital expenditures. Broadly speaking, however, excluding newbuild payments, the minimum required CapEx needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleet is generally a few hundred million. Going forward, we do not expect a straight-line recovery, so we will take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash, while at the same time balancing the need to drive new cash bookings. Shifting the focus to our financial results. The third quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic. As a result, we recorded a net loss on a U.S. GAAP basis of approximately $677 million or $2.50 per share. Turning to Slide 11. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the third quarter increased, driven by the $775 million of net proceeds from our July capital raise after completing the payoff of our short-term credit facility. This was partially offset by customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $200 million; approximately $450 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A interest and required CapEx; and a net working capital outflow of approximately $25 million. Looking ahead, given the continued impacts of the pandemic, we will report a net loss on a U.S. GAAP basis for both the fourth quarter and the year ending December 31, 2020. Before turning the call back to Frank, I want to emphasize that we -- while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also focused on the future of our company. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, as laid out on Slide 12, focuses on 3 critical components : first, rebuild and gradually return to pre-COVID margin levels. We also continue to identify opportunities to drive margin expansion through structural cost reductions and a continued strong focus on price discipline.  Second, maximize cash generation, which will be bolstered by a robust and disciplined growth profile of 9 cash-accretive ships on order through 2027. And third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delevering. The decision to increase our leverage and issue shares was not taken lightly. But given the extraordinary circumstances presented by the pandemic, these were necessary steps. Despite these transactions, our weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5%. And our priority, once we emerge on the other side of this, is to focus on improving the balance sheet, as we have demonstrated and proven our ability to do so time and time again.  I'll now hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. I'd like to leave you with a few key takeaways on Slide 13. We will continue to work with our expert advisers, including Healthy Sail Panel and the CDC to refine our science-backed plans for a safer and healthy return to cruise to protect our guests, crew and communities we visit. We continue to observe strong demand for cruising across all source markets, deployments and brands in both the medium and longer term. And lastly, we are focused on the initial resumption of voyages in the U.S. in a gradual phased relaunch worldwide as we work in partnership with authorities around the globe. With that, Crystal, please open the call up for questions. Operator : . Our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : I have so many, more than one question, but I will follow the rule. So Mark, considering that you kind of ended your prepared comments on your cash flow liquidity and your plans in terms of your long-term financial recovery plan, I did have to ask that given that you could continue that cash outflows longer than you initially anticipated -- and you guys read that out a lot on the call, and acknowledging that your liquidity runway takes you well into next year, just wondering how you're thinking about accessing the capital markets for further liquidity. Your competitors have recently tapped the markets, so just wondering your thoughts there. Mark Kempa : Thanks, Felicia. We continue to look and have the ability to access the capital markets should we need to. As we've said in the past, we believe -- and as we said on this call, we believe we have a very solid runway with just almost $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So as we look forward, we will be -- we will look at it on an opportunistic basis. But given -- like I've said in my prepared remarks, we've raised almost $4 billion this year so far, or almost $5 billion of incremental cash when you include the drawdowns of the revolver. So we have the ability. We're constantly looking at it, but we're not in a rush. We're going to do it on an as-needed and on an opportunistic basis. Felicia Hendrix : And can you just remind us what your balance sheet looks like just in terms of raising further debt? And do you think something like an ATM structure would be more attractive under these circumstances? Mark Kempa : Yes. When you look at our raises to date, roughly half of it, roughly $2.5 billion has been via debt. So we've obviously encumbered the balance sheet pretty heavily. So looking forward, it would not be our desire to -- necessarily our first desire to issue any incremental debt. We do not have the ability to offer any material secured debt as we are at our limits on our negative covenants. However, there could be opportunities to issue unsecured debt. But most likely, we are looking at -- if we go down that path, it would be some sort of equity-type transaction, whether it be an ATM, similar to whatever competitors have done or any further exchangeable type or common equity. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandt Montour from JPMorgan. Brandt Montour : So I hate to ask such a short-term question, but obviously there's a lot of exciting headlines in the cruise world out there over the last couple of weeks. So I was just curious regarding bookings that you guys were seeing, we were all sort of expecting some type of positive inflection when the CDC finally lifted its No Sail Order. Wondering what you saw when that order was converted to the Conditional Sailing Order? And then if I may, I know it's only been a day since the vaccine news. But if you've seen any type of positive uptick in bookings data over the last 24 hours. Frank Del Rio : It's Frank. So bookings in the last 24 hours yesterday were pretty good, better than the previous 4 or 5 Mondays. And that's, I think, attributable to the vaccine news. We did not have any particular promotion or did any outsized marketing. So I do think that, that was a positive news. Contrary to when the Conditional Sail Order was issued, it was issued late on a Friday. Bookings are typically weak on over the weekend. We didn't see much of an uptick, much of anything given the CDC news. Most consumers, I don't think, follow that level of detail of what happens at the CDC level vis-\u00e0-vis the cruise industry. But the vaccine is something that is -- made huge news. Stock market hit an all-time high. So it was front and center on all consumers' minds. Brandt Montour : Got it. Frank, that's great color. And then I wanted to ask a quick question about the medium and long term financial recovery plan. Number one, rebuilding margins. I was wondering if you'd give any thought into what the potential sort of margin differential would you be looking out a couple of years when, let's say, your top line is back to 2019 levels. If you have given any thought on what that -- how much better the margin, normalized margins could be in that scenario. Frank Del Rio : Well, as you know, we did have industry-leading margins. We were very happy with our margins. Today, we have no margins. So it's not like we have to rebuild from where we are, we just want to get back to where we were.  And I believe that going forward, we're going to have, as Mark mentioned, 9 new vessels that are going to be high-yielding, very cash accretive joining our fleet over the next few years. That's going to help margins.  And I think we all have learned, through this pandemic, ways to control costs better. We are amazed that we do as well as we do booking-wise with little or no advertising and marketing and very little support from the travel agency communities. So we think there may be opportunities on the costs side.  But primarily, we are a revenue-driven, marketing-driven company. We win the game given our size, not because we're the best at controlling costs given our limited scale, but we're the best at generating the highest ticket yields in the industry by a very wide margin, the highest onboard revenue yields by even a wider margin. And we think that will continue and grow as we bring on these 9 incredible ships that we have on order. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So Frank, in the past, you've indicated it could take 5 to 6 months before your full fleet would -- potentially could get mobilized. And I'm guessing the question is based on what you know today or what you know now, is that still a pretty fair range? And then the second part of that question would be maybe help us think about when you would potentially see a full recovery, meaning kind of getting back to that 2019 EBITDA level. You've been helpful in the past kind of walking us through that. Frank Del Rio : Look, it's still very fuzzy, very fluid. We don't have a single ship operating, so this is very speculative, Steve. In terms of how long it's going to take to get the full fleet up and going, my best sense today, given all the uncertainties that we still have to work out with the CDC and when we can start, is 6 to 9 months.  Broadly speaking, I look at 2021 as a transition year. I believe that we will be able to have our entire fleet up and running sometime in the latter half of '21, so that 2022 becomes the first full year since 2019 that we can operate the entire fleet for the full year. '22 is the road to normalization. And then '23 forward is normalization.  So a lot of questions still to be answered. We still have travel restrictions around the world, travel bans in some cases. Airlines have got to get back up and running. Ports have got to open. But let's look at just what's happened in the last 2 weeks, 1.5 weeks. We have the framework from the CDC. That was step one. We are very encouraged by the CDC's willingness to sit down and discuss the issues that we see with the order with us. We think that's going to start very, very soon, and that's just a great positive note.  We've seen the vaccine. And although it's going to take some time for the vaccine to find its way throughout the populations of the world, it's what we've been hoping for, and my guess is that the Pfizer vaccine may be the first out of the gate, but they won't be the only one. And just this morning, the breakthrough therapeutic from Eli Lilly is certainly a very positive step. We've seen incredible leaps in progress in the technology of testing.  So we now have some wind to our back. We've got that flywheel going a little bit. And so my -- the encouragement, the excitement level is -- hasn't been this high in a long, long time. So we're encouraged, but still a lot of obstacles to overcome. We're prepared. We've got the liquidity. We've got the know-how. We've got the history behind us. We're going to get over this. Mark Kempa : And Steve, to add on that, this is not a race. We are cognizant, we said we are going to take our time. We want to instill confidence in the consumers. We want to instill confidence in all the constituents with our brand. So you only get one shot to do that right. So we're going to take it on a methodical approach and do it right because again you have one shot to do it. Frank Del Rio : Yes. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, guys. And Mark, can I ask one more quick one? That -- the $175 million you called out in the fourth quarter in terms of cash burn, does -- and I understand that's upticking mostly because of interest. But are there any costs embedded in there in terms of getting some of your crew back in place for these test cruises? Or if that doesn't, can you help us think about maybe what that cash burn does start to look like over the next couple of months as you do start to get folks and ships back in position? Mark Kempa : The $175 million for Q4 is really on a like-for-like basis, just to give you a comparison of how that stacks up against Q3. And again, the differential is really just the timing of cash interest. So no, the $175 million does not include any material start-up costs that we may incur. But given where we are today and given the lead time in which we think we need to stand up vessels, there could be some more -- slightly higher costs that come through in Q4 certainly.  But I don't anticipate that it would be material. At the end of the day, your first and largest cost is really repatriating your crew. And fortunately, we have ships to do that right now, so it doesn't really cost us an incremental lot of dollars to do that. So that's first and foremost. All the other related start-up costs are going to happen closer into your actual start-up, with the exception of marketing. So yes, there may be some slightly higher, but I don't anticipate that it will be materially different. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : I wanted to talk a little bit more on the future cruise credits. I think in August, you were seeing something like a little under half of those canceled cruisers taking the FCCs. Not sure if you mentioned that updated number and what you've been seeing recently. And then the second part of that is I think you alluded to half of FCCs still being outstanding, which represents a really nice base of pent-up demand that you've already spent kind of the marketing dollars on. As you think about that group of customers booking for next year, booking for 2022, can the pricing on the overall booked position continue to hold at what's really impressive at flat as more of those FCCs come into the mix? Mark Kempa : Yes. So Vince, this is Mark. Thanks. On your first question in terms of the refund rate, yes, it has been hovering slightly in the mid-50s, and that was really as a result of the refund pressure that we incurred in the early part of the pandemic. But when you look at the last 3 months or so of canceled voyages, that average rate has gone down significantly, somewhere in the 30 to mid-30 percentile range. So again, it's broadly overall. So that's been -- that again shows confidence from our existing consumers.  And you're absolutely right, when you look at it on a go-forward basis, we do have a nice book of business inherently on the books from those FCC customers. So what that's going to allow us to do is that allows us, number one, to leverage our cost base. We don't have to remarket to those. When we do remarket to them, we're going to certainly try and see if we can upgrade those customers. And what we're finding, and I think I've said this in the past, is those customers inherently have a 25% bonus on their hands today. So what we're finding is that when they rebook, they're actually upgrading over and above the 25% incremental. So that's been beneficial to us as well, so certainly I think that's going to help pricing. We've always said that we want to maintain price discipline. We are maintaining it, and we can see that in our booking patterns and our pricing commentary. Frank Del Rio : Yes. Vince, note that we said in my prepared statements that a little over half of all FCCs issued to date have been redeemed. So of all the FCCs that we've issued, they represent about 15% of annual capacity. So that means that 7.5% of annual capacity has already been redeemed. It's not insignificant, but not material. And we've seen that pricing for '21 and '22 is flat to slightly higher than it was prior to the pandemic for like-for-like periods.  So the bottom line is the FCC redemption has had zero effect on pricing. We're maintaining pricing for new bookings. And since people have the 25% bonus, should we raise prices, it's still a great deal for them. So bottom line is FCCs are not going to be affecting future pricing decisions. Operator : Our next question comes from Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Jaime Katz : I'm curious if you guys have any noteworthy trends you can share from the 40% of the consumers that are not repeat cruisers to the brand. So I think on one of the slides, it said 60% were loyal repeat cruisers. Are you seeing any differences in behavior on booking trends or anything like that, that would be helpful to us? Frank Del Rio : No, nothing that we've discerned. Marketing is being done more online than digitally than we would normally do because, again, of wanting to preserve cash and the fact that travel agents are not as active as they normally do. So we find, and this is one of the potential areas of future cost savings, is that digital marketing is a real venue. And it's not just kids buying things on Amazon or on Instagram. People are buying cruises worth thousands and thousands of dollars online. And we think that's a trend that the pandemic might have accelerated, the whole Zoom world. So we think that's a positive on a net-net basis. And we'll continue to manage our business and manage our workforce and devote resources to this kind of digital transformation that we find ourselves in. Jaime Katz : Okay. And then just out of curiosity, I know the original restart duration was for 6 months when you guys were estimating it, and that went from 6 to 9 months. I assume that's more about logistics and not about anything structural that's stretching that time period out. Is that right? Frank Del Rio : Yes, it's logistics. It's the prevalence of the disease around the world. It's seasonal. If ship number 25 is ready to go in September 1 and she normally would have been in Alaska, maybe we don't bring her up on September 1 because the season is almost over and it would be penny-wise, pound-foolish to stand her up then and there. And maybe we wait until the following month when she normally would have been in the Caribbean. So those types of positionings and deployments, considerations like that are important. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : So just a clarification on back to sailing. When do you expect to start the trial sailings? And how long do you expect the trials to take? And then should it take 6 to 9 months after that to get all the ships sailing? And kind of a follow-up question, at what point in there do you see free cash or EBITDA breakeven? Frank Del Rio : You've overstepped your boundary of one question, Thomas, but we'll do our best to remember. Thomas Allen : I hope I don't get in trouble. Frank Del Rio : The question police won't get you. Look, we have a lot of questions to sit down with the CDC to work out. But if you just read literally the order and the sequence that we need to get a vessel ready to start the sailings, we think those sailings could start as early as early January.  As Mark said, this is not a race for us. We want to get this 100% right. We're stressing flawless execution. There's still a lot to learn about the order and the nuances of how to execute those orders, how to implement the 74 recommendations seamlessly along with the framework that the CDC has laid out. And those are complex issues, what kind of testing, how often do we test, et cetera.  So don't pin me down to an exact date, but I would tell you that there's a chance that maybe some companies can start these trial cruises in December. We don't forecast that we will be wanting to do so until probably sometime in January. And then there's another series of sequence that the CDC has called for in terms of giving notice and getting the ship certified on a ship-by-ship basis, the audits they'd have to go through. And so we're very reluctant to give you a date of when the first trial sailing begins because your next question is going to be, \"Well then when is your first revenue sailing going to begin?\" And we simply don't know at this early stage when that is.  In terms of when do we return to EBITDA breakeven or cash breakeven on a ship-by-ship basis, we have said that given where our pricing is, which is historical levels, we believe that number on a ship-by-ship basis is somewhere between 40% to 50% depending on the ship, the size of vessel and so forth. On a corporate level, I would be very hesitant, so hesitant that I'm not going to answer the question as to when we would be, corporate-wise, EBITDA breakeven or even cash breakeven. It's going to take some time. Mark Kempa : And just to further elaborate on that, if you look at our working capital change over from Q2 to Q3, it's essentially -- we essentially flattened it out excluding our normal ongoing operating expenses. So we are making progress there. And it's just going to take time. It's going to be a matter of what load factor capacities we roll out, how quick the ships are rolling out.  So it's tough to give you an answer to say we're going to be cash flow positive on x date. There's so many variables involved. But I can assure you that we are going to ramp up our costs on an as-needed basis. We will be very disciplined about it, as I said in my prepared remarks. But we will spend the dollars where we need to, to protect price and drive demand, which is what we always do. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Golding from Macquarie. Paul Golding : Appreciate the detail, as always. For either Mark or Frank, I was wondering in the table that you have around pro forma liquidity, you have that $300 million cash health and safety initiatives component. I was wondering if you could give any detail around how much that covers the fleet or how long that's supposed to be good for. Is that just for an initial restart? Any color around that? And then I have a follow-up. Frank Del Rio : Yes. That $300 million obviously is an estimate. And when you look at it on a go-forward basis, what we really were trying to do is give the market color on some of the funds that we're carving out. So in the past, I think we've said we -- in the past couple of calls, we've estimated that we think we need $100 million to $150 million of investments to make the ships safer under the new standards. That's going to be spent over time. It's not all going to be spent in the fourth quarter or the first quarter. It's going to come out over time, over the next few quarters. So that's not going to be an immediate outflow, but it's an estimate.  As you can imagine, as the framework has been issued and as we continue to assess the more intricate technical guidelines around that framework, that enables us to then determine what needs we have on the back end for investment purposes. So again, we just wanted to be cognizant that we were carving out a significant amount of funds related to that to cover ourselves. Paul Golding : Got it. So not implying that it's payable or going to be spent immediately once there's some sort of resumption. Frank Del Rio : You can think about that, but that outflow would probably happen over the course of 2 to 3 quarters. Paul Golding : Got it. That's super helpful. And then the follow-up I had around basically liquidity again would be -- we saw the Regent 2023 World Cruise go up, and you've got that far out booking available. I was wondering how you're considering pricing versus far out bookings now for the other brands from a liquidity shoring perspective. Frank Del Rio : Our pricing strategy has not changed. As you know if you go back to the last 4 or 5 years, on average, we're able to raise our ticket yields in the 3% to 4% range. We want to continue that trend. We think that the combination of pent-up demand in the marketplace, our industry-leading brands, less capacity in the marketplace, the new ships that are coming online for us, if you recall, we had so many underpenetrated markets or markets where we simply didn't have a presence because we don't -- we only have 28 ships. We long for our vessels, newer vessels to come online, and we think that will help the overall yield growth profile of our company. Mark Kempa : And Paul, the remarks around the Regent and Oceania bookings, I think that was more of us signaling more around the demand, that there is solid demand out there and there's pent-up demand. From a liquidity standpoint, if you think about it, that really doesn't impact us or benefit us in the near term, as yes we do get deposits, initial deposits from that. But the bulk of those funds don't come in until roughly anywhere, on average, 120 to depending -- it could be 180 days on a world voyager or more. But again, there's got -- going to be a significant near-term liquidity benefit from that. Paul Golding : Is there a general rule that you're comfortable with sharing as far as how much is of the deposit base is nonrefundable at this point? Mark Kempa : Well, yes, it's fully refundable. We don't -- at this point in time, we don't have nonrefundable fares. So it is fully refundable up until, again depending on the voyage, anywhere from 120 to -- could be 180 days or more for a world voyage. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Chaiken from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Benjamin Chaiken : With regards to the CDC no sail update, the way I read it, I guess the -- I think the dates for ship approval simulated testing and then revenue sailings all kind of run on a sequential time line. I think it's 30 days for the simulator and then 60 days for the revenue sailing. That's number one, is that correct? And then two, is there any opportunity or wiggle room that, that process could be changed to run concurrently, I guess? Frank Del Rio : Yes, not all those periods and notice periods are sequential. We think they are concurrent. And those are some of the clarification questions that we have that we will be discussing with the CDC in coming weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners. Ivan Feinseth : What are your thoughts on developing more private islands and like creating more of a controlled destination environment and building on -- let's say, you just said -- once said if you had a hotel on Great Stirrup Cay, it would be one of the world-class destinations in the Caribbean and creating -- shifting to something like that? Frank Del Rio : Yes, I still stand by those comments. Ivan, as you know, we're the only cruise company that actually has a private island private destination in the Western Caribbean. A lot of folks have it in the Bahamas area, as we do at Great Stirrup of where we've made significant investments in making it an upscale destination, as you mentioned. And we're very, very proud, very happy. It doesn't get the fanfare that the Bahamian Islands get. Maybe that's our fault. But great -- excuse me, Harvest Caye in Belize is just a wonderful destination. And we think that because of the pandemic, over time, the new vessels coming online, that it will be more utilized than it has been in the past as we position vessels around the southern part of the country that can reach Belize and back in 7 days or so.  So we're very happy with those 2 islands. You take what we're doing in Alaska, where we have made major investments in real estate development in Ketchikan with Ward Cove, the land we bought in Juneau. So we now have -- besides the investment we've made in Seattle at the port there, we are really, really in good shape in leading the industry in controlling the destinations that we need so that we can deploy even more vessels to Alaska. Real estate is expensive, and it takes a lot of money to develop real estate. I think that around the world, I'd love to have a private island in the Mediterranean. Let me know if you know any for sale. I don't think there are.  But we're very happy with what we've got today, one in the Bahamas, one in Western Caribbean, our Alaska investment. The situation we have in Hawaii with our private American vessel and the fact that it's the only American flag vessel that can cruise in Hawaii, gives us even more flexibility there. So we are very -- we're very happy with our land-based offerings. And we'll keep an eye out in case there's other available. But for the time being, we're very pleased with what we got. Ivan Feinseth : But do you think that... Frank Del Rio : Yes, go ahead, Ivan. I'm sorry. Ivan Feinseth : Consumers, let's say, because you could create a controlled environment once people are onboard, let's say, in Miami, and been tested and then they go to your island for example, they're still in this contained environment that you control. So at some point if that could be -- I mean that, I believe, would be a good vacation. And marketing that as being, \"I would like to have a nice vacation, but have limited outside exposure.\" Frank Del Rio : Certainly, the bubble that we're trying to create onboard can be created in private islands. But remember that what we're going through now is not what we're going to go through forever. And I don't want to make long-term investments, long-term decisions in order to fix a short-term problem.  But we've seen that our customers like these private destinations. They're controlled. Forget about the health and safety part of it, they're controlled just from an experience point of view. And I'm glad I've got two of them. So -- but I do think that -- look, the pandemic won't last forever. We will return to normalcy. People do like variety in itineraries. People do like itinerary-rich -- or port-intensive itineraries. And we're hoping that -- and our plan is to continue to offer that. Thanks, Ivan. Operator : And our last question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Thanks for sneaking me in. This is a bit of a multi-parter follow-up for Mark. But can you maybe help us think about free cash flow sensitivities to different occupancy levels? And then just touch on kind of intermediate-term target net debt to EBITDA levels. And also how the long-term kind of pre-COVID targets of 2.5 to 2.75x has maybe changed or not changed in the longer term. Mark Kempa : Yes, yes. Look, obviously we're targeting to get back to our reduced net leverage levels. That's going to take time, and there's a lot of variables in between there. But we're focused on that.  In terms of sensitivities on the cash flows and load factors, again we've said generally a ship breaks even roughly at 40% to 50%. So if you take that, that can kind of give you your free cash flow sensitivity from there. And the second part, I apologize, I got lost on your second part of the question. Stephen Grambling : It was more on the leverage levels, just thinking through if there's like an intermediate-term target that you might be thinking about to get ahead of some of that order book. Mark Kempa : Yes, to lower, to lower it as soon as we can. I mean number one, we need earnings and we need visibility on the industry. So our number one -- one of our top priorities as we emerge from this is going to be figuring out how do we delever and finding financial flexibility in the markets to possibly refinance some of our debt, or again, balance sheet management. So that's front and center, but we have to emerge out of this first. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Steve. And thanks, everyone, for your time and support, your patience during our third distanced earnings call. As always, we'll be available to answer your questions later on today. Stay safe. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time.  As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Josh, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make references a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today\u2019s call. Before we discuss our results, I\u2019d like to cover just a few items. Our press release with our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and our presentation. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning. I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones remained healthy and safe. Similar to our last few earnings call, we will focus our commentary today on the progress of our response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The overall booking and pricing environment, which has shown particular strength in recent weeks and our view of what the month that had may look like as we prepare for an eventual return to service. To say that 2020 what\u2019s challenging would be an incredible understatement. As it was without a doubt, the toughest and most difficult year in our company\u2019s 50 plus year history. After a record breaking 2019, the foundation was well set for 2020 to be even a more successful year. That upward trajectory, however quickly changed last March and 2020 instead became a year of great hardship and disappointment and one in which we had to rely on our nimbleness and our ability to adapt by taking swift proactive and decisive actions to overcome the multifaceted challenges presented by the pandemic. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan, as well as our roadmap to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve and we continue to focus on what we can control, and we are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy as needed. Slide 7, illustrates three focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the fourth quarter. First, we have reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures, three number of initiatives, including the further reduction or deferral of near-term marketing expenses, reduction of non-essential capital expenditures, extended salary reductions and furloughs for shoreside team members. In fact, we reduced capital expenditures by approximately 60% for each of the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, we finalize the deferral of \u20ac220 million of new building related shipyard payments through the end of the first quarter 2022. Second, we have also made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile in order to provide additional near-term financial flexibility through the following actions. We amended our pride of America, Norwegian Jewel and senior secured credit facilities to suspend testing of certain covenants. This covenant relief extends through maturity for the pride of America and Jewel facilities and through year end 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. We were also able to defer $70 million of amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. Second, we secured deferrals for approximately $680 million of our export credit agency backed amortization payments, representing 100% of our ECA payments originally due through the first quarter of 2022. We also received covenant waivers through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 on our ECA facilities. We have tremendous support behind us from our strong longstanding relationships with our export credit agencies  and Hermes. Our ECA and commercial lenders, as well as the shipyard. Their assistance is playing a significant role in our ability to weather this pandemic and we can\u2019t thank them enough for their continued and ongoing partnership during these unprecedented times. The final focus area of our action plan was securing additional capital. In the fourth quarter, we executed two highly successful transactions. In November, we raised $824 million of net proceeds through an equity offering of 40 million ordinary shares. And in December, we issued $850 million of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026 in an oversubscribed offering. To-date, we\u2019ve accessed the capital markets five times over a nine-month period. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we raised incremental cash of nearly $6.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This tremendous accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of our finance, treasury, legal and accounting teams, who have worked tirelessly around the clock to execute on these initiatives. We have also experienced an incredible outpouring of support from our investors and again, we can\u2019t thank you enough for having conviction in our business model and our management team and in the long-term potential of our company. Slide 8, outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile and response to the crisis. Since the third quarter, we secured debt amortization deferrals of approximately $750 million, resulting in minimal debt service payments for the remainder of 2021. Turning to liquidity, Slide 9, provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of year-end was approximately $3.2 billion, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable at quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $300 million for anticipated health and safety investments and other collateral obligations. While we anticipate variability in our health and safety investments as we work through the various requirements and continuously improve and refine our protocols, we wanted to earmark this investment in our illustrative liquidity profile. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $2.9 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan. As for cash burn, our team continues to work day in and day out to further reduce expenses and conserve cash. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn rate with the low watermark representing a nearly 80% reduction in crews operating expenses versus normalized levels. For the fourth quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $190 million. This included approximately $15 million per month due to additional expenses related to preparing vessels or potential return to service in early 2021, and included a limited increase and associated marketing events investments as Frank discussed earlier. As for the first quarter, we expect the average cash burn to temporarily remain elevated at approximately $190 million per month or approximately $170 million per month, excluding non-debt recurring \u2013 non-recurring debt modification costs as we ramped down our relaunch-related expenses and repatriate crew. Approximately $60 million of one-time cost we incurred in the quarter is a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months. Once the ramp down of relaunch-related expenses, including crew repatriation efforts are complete, we expect that the average cash burn rate to decrease and remain it reduce levels until return to service preparations resume. We will continue to take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash. While at the same time, balance the need to drive new cash bookings. Turning to Slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the fourth quarter increased driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds from capital raises and was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, which includes operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx. Customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $120 million and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $20 million, which includes health and safety investments. Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our voyage resumption, we are not yet prepared to provide guidance on all metrics. However, we have provided guidance on depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild related capital expenditures to assist with modeling, which can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 19 of the presentation. Broadly speaking, excluding newbuild related capital expenditures, we still expect the minimum required capital expenditures needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleets is generally a few hundred million dollars per year. Before handing the call back, I want to reemphasize that while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also very focused on the future of our company. Our medium and long-term financial recovery plan, which was provided on Slide 11 focuses on three critical components. First, rebuild and gradually returned to pre-COVID margin levels, while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion. Second, maximize our cash generation. And third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks today, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail and Sustain, which is on Slide 12. Despite the current public health challenges we face, our commitment to protect and preserve our oceans, the environment and the destinations we visit, while enhancing our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion of workforce remains at the very core of our everyday operations. So that in 2020, we launched unconscious bias, microaggression and diversity and inclusion training for our global workforce and have committed to expand our diverse hiring practices. We are also building upon our supplier diversity program, as part of our efforts to facilitate and encourage the growth of small and diverse businesses. We strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workforce \u2013 workplace for our team members across the globe. We believe our team members are by far our most important resource, and that has never been clear to me and during this crisis. We are pleased at this commitment to our team\u2019s development and wellbeing was recognized recently with our naming to the Forbes America\u2019s Best Employers list, in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall large employer category and among the 10 top companies in the travel and leisure sector. Just as we support our team members, we are also committed to supporting our local communities and the destination we visit. This past year, we launched two initiatives in partnership with trust goods. Giving Tuesday, we matched every case of Just Water purchased in December through their online store with water donation to local food banks in Miami and New York City. Separately, we provided nearly $275,000 of in kind donations in the form of Just Water and non-perishable and canned goods to support two community organizations and assist ongoing relief efforts in the Archipelago of San Andr\u00e9s in Colombia, after the devastating impact of Category 5 Hurricane Iota. Furthering our partnership with JUST Goods, we are also currently in the process of organizing several truckloads of Just water Donations to benefit food banks located in areas around the Southwest of the United States that have been severely affected by the recent winter storms. Dedication to family and community is ingrained in our culture and to further demonstrate this commitment beginning this year, we are offering our U.S. shoreside team members, a paid volunteer day to give back to community programs of your choice. On the environmental front, we are proud to have improved our score in our second CDP climate change submission to late B, which is higher than the marine transport sector, North America and global average. For 2021, we will be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency. I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are focused on the execution of our roadmap to relaunch as quickly as possible. And we\u2019ll continue to work with our expert advisors, global public health authorities and government agencies to refine our science back plans or a swift, safe and healthy return to cruising. Second, strong future demand for cruising across all brands, source markets and deployments continue. And early indications for 2022 bookings are extremely positive with load factors, besting our previous high by a substantial margin. Lastly, we continue to keep our longer term strategic and financial priorities in focus, and we will be ready to execute on our recovery plans to improve our balance sheet. Strong future demand we are experiencing coupled with the positive momentum in the public health front, both extremely well for our prospects. And with that, Josh, please let\u2019s open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio.  Our first question comes from Brandt Montour with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Brandt Montour : Hey, everyone. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to maybe follow back up Frank, on your comments on Alaska. You sort of referenced the industry\u2019s attempt to try and salvage some of the Alaskan season. I assume for the sailings that are leaving and arriving from Seattle, where I know you guys do much of your business. So I guess, maybe if you could just give us your view on the potential success of those talks and then just remind us the portion of your Alaska business that\u2019s in and out of Seattle. Frank Del Rio : It\u2019s difficult to predict, what the outcome will be. We\u2019re encouraged that the situation with Alaska and in the Canadian closure until spring of 2022 has been noted by various government officials. And they\u2019re trying to do their best. As you know, tourism is the third largest industry in Alaska. And for certain Alaskan coastal communities, cruising is over 90% of their tourism business. And so if we can operate in Alaska in 2021, that\u2019ll be two years that they will go without this infusion of business activity and that\u2019s going to be difficult for them. And so we\u2019re hopeful, cautiously optimistic, it\u2019s a lot of hoops to jump through both from the Canadian side and also let\u2019s face it the \u2013 we cannot operate as of today in U.S. waters and Alaska water. So we have suspended taking new bookings on Alaska. I think the whole industry has. But we do hope \u2013 we do hold out some hope that these initiatives led by the Alaskan delegation can open up Alaska for 2021. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks for that. And then I wanted to also ask about the relaunch efforts in the 1Q that you reversed. And I think that you made the announcement that you would repatriate some crew. I think that was as of late January, you made that announcement. And so I guess, with the latest murmurings out of the industry that you could get CDC guidance, maybe any day now. I just want to reconcile those two things and understand maybe your timeline and the decision process to send folks on. Frank Del Rio : Yes. I think there \u2013 let\u2019s clarify a couple of things. The CDC guidance that we as an industry are expecting sometime in the future and I won\u2019t label it as a few days, because I simply don\u2019t know. It could be a few days \u2013 could be a few weeks, we simply don\u2019t know. That doesn\u2019t \u2013 that is the next phase of this multi-phase of approach that the CDC has taking. I don\u2019t believe that we are awaiting in the next few days, the green light to cruise, that would not be correct. But in terms of our decision to pull back, look, when the CDC conditional Sail Order first came out, there was great expectation. We had a conditional Sail Order. And it proved to be more difficult than we first expected. We also were in the middle of a spike in the number of cases. And so it became obvious to us that the initial expectation that maybe the industry could begin to cruise in the first quarter, which is heavily focused on Caribbean theater of operations, was not going to take place. And so we took the difficult decision to reduce our cash burn repatriate those crew members back home and cut down on the marketing expenses that we have begun to ramp up to along with the ships that we thought we could operate. And so today, I would tell you that we are in a better place, a more encouraging place. And we were even just six weeks ago, at the end of the day, I think the prevalence of the disease in our own country and around the world will be the greatest indicator of one we can resume cruising. And the prevalence is dropping. And we believe based on all the experts that we talked to, including the Healthy Sail Panel that we\u2019re going to see a continuation of the significant drop in cases as we enter spring summer, as we continue to vaccinate over 1.5 million Americans a day, as more people get infected and recover. So all those things point into a direction where the prevalence should drop considerably giving us a better opportunity to restart operations. Brandt Montour : Very helpful. Thanks for the comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, good money guys. Just Frank, to add on to that your last commentary there, if the CDC gave you guys kind of the all clear kind of smoke signal to get to that test phase component and to start up the test cruises. Is that still \u2013 would you still need about 90 days or could you shorten that up a little bit? Frank Del Rio : We think that, it can be short and I know that there is a 60 day sort of waiting period, the conversations we\u2019ve been having with them, it\u2019s not a hard 60 days. I think it could be less. But how much less? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ve not received that kind of specificity on these guidelines, but we generally believe that from the moment that we get the green light, depending on where the ships are that you want to stand up, depending on the seasonality, summer is a \u2013 where are the ships in summer, generally, they\u2019re in Europe, they\u2019re in Alaska. Where are they in the fall winter? They\u2019re primarily in the Caribbean, Mexico, Panama Canal, around the world. But I think, for planning purposes, we\u2019d like to give ourselves that 90-day window more or less. And so we\u2019ve canceled cruises through the end of May. So if you count with your fingers, we basically March 1, so all of March, all of April, all of May. And it\u2019s sequential. We keep bookings and cruising \u2013 cruises available as long as we believe, there is a chance that we can operate. Once we know, we start entering that 90-day or so window. And we always to everyone in the ecosystem, whether it\u2019s travel agents, consumers, our own employees to crew to cancel cruises in the future. So we\u2019re always hopeful that the public health situation improves and that we can restart as soon as we possibly can. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. Thanks, Frank. And then second question would be around out your booking trends across your brands. And I know you indicated that booking trends seem pretty similar across all three brands, but I wanted to dig in a little bit more into your luxury brands, given the strong pent up demand we have seen from the 60 plus age demographic across other consumer verticals. And I guess, the question is, has that demographic been very active in terms of booking. And has there been any changes in their preference in terms of length of itinerary or destination? I hope that makes sense. Frank Del Rio : It does make sense, Steve. Look, early in the pandemic, people were writing off the mature market. And it\u2019s been anything about that. So as you know, the upscale brands tend to book further out than the contemporary brand, partly because of the itineraries, the longer more exotic itineraries, everything else being equal, people book further out. And so we\u2019re continuing to see that. I mean, both Oceania and Regent are nearly 40% booked for 2022. That\u2019s much better than they\u2019ve ever been at this stage of the booking cycle. And so these are folks who are typically over the age of 65, the average age at Oceania and Regent is consistently in the 66, 67 age range. And these are the folks who are getting the vaccine first and they\u2019ve been cooped up and they want to go out. I mean, they\u2019re no different than 40-year olds or 30-year olds. They\u2019ve got the money and they\u2019re booking further and further out. As we said in our prepared remarks, the booking curve is now double, what normally is. And that\u2019s because of two reasons. One, there are literally no bookings being made for the next three or four months sailing, because they\u2019ve been canceled. And people are booking further and further out. People know that this pandemic will end someday. And that someday is tomorrow, but further up. So we have more visibility today in our future business than we\u2019ve ever had. And so that\u2019s one of the things that encourages me the most. I mean, I have a lot of things to worry about these days, Steve. Fundamental consumer demand and our ability to fill our ships at strong pricing is not one of them. And to be able to do what we\u2019re doing in terms of the load factors and new bookings, new cash bookings with the de minimis amount of marketing that we\u2019re doing with the travel agency system being less than 100% is truly remarkable. And again, points to what we\u2019ve been saying for years, the resiliency of the consumer, the resiliency of those who love to cruise. It\u2019s a great value that hasn\u2019t changed. And people are eager to get back to the high seas. There\u2019s no question about that. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks for the color, Frank. Appreciate it. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thanks. Yes, just looking at some other cruise lines that are operating in Asia and have operated in Europe. I\u2019m just curious, are the cruise lines sharing their learnings and protocols, particularly thinking of the cruise line that you\u2019re on the Healthy Sail Panel with, whether you\u2019re kind of getting the benefit of those starts in other regions. Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Hi, Robin. Yes. Look, we don\u2019t compete on safety and health issues. And the industry has been very, very cooperative with one another. We do share our findings, we find that those companies brands that are operating, whether it\u2019s in Asia or in Europe are very much forthcoming, much like, Royal and us to develop the Healthy Sail Panel, that 74 protocols we made them available to the entire industry, the entire industry has adopted them. So it\u2019s a very good and healthy dynamic. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. And then just a quick follow up, I think I can guess the answer to this, but you guys have not sold any ships and some other companies have. I know you have the youngest fleet out there. And so maybe the answer is that, you have no interest or need to sell any ships. Are you \u2013 is that something you\u2019ve thought about at all or had conversations about. Frank Del Rio : No, we \u2013 you pointed out, we do have the youngest fleet. Every one of our ships produce positive margins, positive EBITDA, a good ROI on their book value. So we have no interest. Only \u2013 being the smallest of the big three is an advantage I believe during this time. We only have to worry about 28 vessels and not some greater number. And also we\u2019re very eager to start taking delivery of the vessels that we have on order which will begin in third quarter of 2022. We\u2019ve been fortunate that during this pandemic, we didn\u2019t have to take any new deliveries. But by the same token, we have zero interest in selling any of our assets. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. You may proceed with your question. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m curious your perspective or updated thinking on the timeline to get the whole fleet back up in the sailing, assuming you have some success with trial sailings, and then begin revenue sailings on a few ships from that point about. How long do you think it would take to get the whole fleet up and running again? Frank Del Rio : We don\u2019t know when that start date is. As I said earlier, the \u2013 directionally, we\u2019re heading in the right direction. The prevalence is decreasing. The vaccines are ramping up. We\u2019re all confident of the protocols, enhanced by the vaccinations. What we have said in the past is that we think that from whatever date that \u2013 it is that we start, it will likely take six to seven months, assuming that the ports are opened around the world, remember our ships are seasonal. One of the requirements is that the ports be open to travel restrictions be lifted, so assuming that those hurdles are cleared. Physically, we think it\u2019ll take six, seven months, so roughly a ship a week. And so for us to be a 100% operative, we would have to start standing up vessels in the June, July timeframe of this year. So that we can be 100% by year end early 2022. Vince Ciepiel : Great. It sounds similar to how you were thinking about it last time. And then on the future cruise credits, last time you noted that I think 65%, 70% of those being canceled here recently, we\u2019re opting for future cruise credits versus cash. I was just curious if that kind of ratio has held. And then also, I think as of last time you had about half of your FCCs still outstanding, which represents an interesting and good base of pent up demand and curious if that number still held as well. Frank Del Rio : I\u2019ll tell you that since I forgot the exact date, but since the fall, at least when we do cancel a set of sailings, like we recently did for the month of May of 22. Everyone gets a cash refund. We\u2019re no longer offering the option of an FCC or cash. We have the liquidity FCCs are dilutive to future business. We don\u2019t want to negatively impact future business any more than the dilutive effect of the existing FCCs. So today, there is no choice. You\u2019ve got your money back. And in terms of the percentage of FCCs that have been redeemed. It varies by brand, but at deconsolidated age level, roughly 40% of all FCCs that we have issued over time have not been redeemed. So there still remains 60% of the FCCs issued in that bucket of folks, who\u2019ve got an ability to rebook. And look, we \u2013 somehow, in some quarters of the investment world, perhaps, FCC bookings are seen as not as good as a cash booking. I think they\u2019re both important. Customers who took an FCC showed a great deal of confidence and support in our business and we want to make sure that they get their crews. And so if we have to extend the booking date or if we have to extend the sailing date, as the suspensions continue, we will do so. We actively encourage people to redeem their FCC. We want them to take a cruise and we also want to be able to clear the deck, so to speak, as soon as possible. So that when we do resume cruising, we can get back to what we do best, which is selling cruises at the highest yields in the industry, both on ticket and onboard revenue so that we can resume our positive momentum that we had at the end of 2019. Mark Kempa : And Vince, just to add on that, I think you had said, mentioned that it was a big book of business. You\u2019re absolutely right. So as we think about that going forward, that gives us opportunities where we can really get more efficient and reduce some of our operating expenses, because our \u2013 simply speaking our acquisition costs, we\u2019ll come down over time with that business. So as Frank said, the FCCs are a good booking, just like any other booking. And it\u2019s a positive sign and having such a significant amount on our books. Vince Ciepiel : Great. I think that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar. You may proceed with your question. Jaime Katz : Hi, good morning. I\u2019m hoping that you guys will help us think through the cash burn over the first half, I guess, there\u2019s this inflated number for 1Q, but theoretically, if you\u2019re going to start ramping in June. You\u2019re going to see some of those costs to repeat as you bring people back to the ships and remand them again. So it\u2019s 170 a month, a better number than some of the numbers maybe you\u2019ve given out in the past for ongoing cash burn, as some of these ships come back online. Mark Kempa : Hi, Jaime, it\u2019s Mark. Yes, I\u2019ll take that. So when we really reduced our cash burn in the third \u2013 and you look at the second quarter, third quarter, we were down to levels of 150, 160. It\u2019s slightly elevated in the fourth quarter, primarily due to some \u2013 additional cash interest and some of our startup activities, which we noted. Some of that is lingering into Q1 as well with the startup activities. And then beyond that, in this environment today, our expectation would be that, we\u2019re going to get back down to those levels we had seen in the earlier part of the year, absent the clear visibility and clear indication that we can start back up. So again, we started this exercise in the fourth quarter. We were hopeful with the conditional Sail Order that we were going to be able to operate early in 2021, obviously, that proved to be a false hope. But it\u2019s really going to be dependent upon when we get that green light and when we get that visibility. But again, if you look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter as we\u2019ve outlined, I think I said on my prepared remarks today, roughly of $15 million a month was related to some of those restart costs. That\u2019s probably the levels you would start to see once we in earnest restart back, whether it\u2019s a second quarter, third quarter, but again, based on when we get that clear path of resumption. Jaime Katz : Okay. And then I think there was a comment in the slide deck that said 60% of the bookings were from loyalists, which would imply 40% were new cruisers. And I know you guys have talked a lot about some of the inroads you\u2019ve made with millennials in the past. And so I\u2019m curious if there has been any different demographic patterns you\u2019ve seen across the fleet in the more recent bookers. Thanks. Mark Kempa : I will tell you that the sweet spot is for folks 55 plus, historically, that is the cohort that the greatest percentage of our guests across all three brands comes from. And we have seen a slight increase in the proportion of total bookings coming from that cohort. And as I said earlier, that is partly because those are the cohorts that have been vaccinated more so than younger ones. These folks are retired, semi-retired, the stock market has been doing well, investments have been doing well. They\u2019ve got cash. And these are people who tend to travel more and they haven\u2019t been able to. So the pent up demand for them for this cohort, I think is greater than younger cohorts. Jaime Katz : Thank you. Mark Kempa : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Grambling : Good morning. Thank you. I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts still, but within that six to seven months that you decided for launching the full fleet. How do you think about occupancy at the ship level within the current CDC framework? And how might the vaccine change that? Frank Del Rio : Well, the CDC is a best of my knowledge has yet to give the industry target occupancy. For our own internal working purposes, we assume that at the beginning that maximum occupancy will be in the 50% range. So think about this, today our entire fleet is available for the book, let\u2019s say, in the third quarter, in July moving forward. Every single ship in the fleet has passengers, there\u2019s bookings on them. We\u2019re going to start, we\u2019re not going to be able to start all 28 vessels. As I said, it\u2019s going to be a little bit, maybe a week, one a week, something like that, which means that there\u2019s going to be a lot of customers who are booked today, who will be displaced. And part of that displacement will be in cancellations, people will get their refunds. But part of it is that people will move from the Norwegian Jewel in Alaska to the Norwegian Bliss in Alaska, or they\u2019ll move from the Oceania Riviera in Europe to the Oceania Marina in Europe. And so we believe that there are enough bookings today, if we never took another booking, let\u2019s say for Q3, assuming a reduced capacity at the start, we don\u2019t have to take any more bookings for Q3. And as you move forward from the start date, you have more ships coming online, less ships that are going to be \u2013 those customers going to be displaced. And so there\u2019ll be a rebalancing, if you will at some point, where we do need to start taking more bookings, but my guess is that that\u2019ll be beginning month three, four forward. And that\u2019s what we were doing. And the restart that Mark and I discussed earlier in our remarks, when we thought we were going to starting in Q1. Because there\u2019s always a book of business there, waiting, hoping to cruise that when we do know we\u2019re going to start that won\u2019t be the entire fleet. And therefore we have excess bookings, if you will at the beginning. So again, of all the things we worry about filling vessels, generating demand just isn\u2019t one of them. But we have \u2013 we don\u2019t have a short-term issue as we just described. And as you heard me say earlier, 2022, more of a longer term business is better than ever. Stephen Grambling : And I guess one of the other things that\u2019s within your control, if you think about the operations and an expense structure, what are some of the things that you think could be structurally changed coming out of this that could ultimately make the shifts more profitable. And as a related follow-up, are there any considerations that we should have on dry dock days coming out of layup? Should that be lower or could it be higher? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : I think, I\u2019ll let Mark answer that. Mark Kempa : Yes. I think, first Steve, on the dry docks, look, ships have to dry dock, they have to stay within the classification society rules. And what I can tell you is, while we have pulled back on our capital expenditures and some of that is related to investments that \u2013 enhancements that we would have made during dry docks, we are not stopping dry docks. Dry docks have to occur by class. And there are certain investments that we\u2019ve continued to make. A good example of that is, some of the scrubbers on the breakaway and getaway. That was \u2013 they were scheduled to be completed in early 2023 and because the ships are out of service and going through their normal, dry dock periods, we\u2019re able to install those sooner. And get the benefit once we restart operating. But I think when you look at the ships going forward, and you look at the cost structure on the ships. By and large, we\u2019ve always said this, the cost structure on a ship is generally a highly fixed cost structure. That said there\u2019s always going to be pockets of opportunity and I think, as we think about our costs going forward, we\u2019re looking at shoreside. This pause has really given us a chance to reevaluate every cost, everything we do from our supply chain to everything we do on our shoreside operations. Frank Del Rio : And I think we\u2019ve mentioned this in the past that, we\u2019re making some pretty significant learnings in our marketing area. We continue to transform toward the digital world, you get more bang for the dollar there. We\u2019re garnering significant amount of booking activity with vis-\u00e0-vis a less marketing spend. So we\u2019re taking those learnings. And every day that we\u2019re in pause, we\u2019re going to continue to look at every nook and cranny and ask ourselves, are we doing this correctly? So I think there\u2019s opportunity for cost enhancement, and then further, as you look further down the future, and you think about that, how does that translate to margin expansion? It\u2019s going to be a combination of reduced costs. We have more efficient capacity coming online with our nine ship new build program. And that\u2019s going to help drive margin expansion. In addition to, again, driving the top line, driving increased pricing that we\u2019ve always been the industry leader in pricing. And as we think about that, if you look at the industry capacity has been reduced. So we think that\u2019s going to provide even more of an opportunity to help rebuild margins and drive that margin expansion. Stephen Grambling : That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much. Frank Del Rio : Operator, we have time for one more question this morning. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial. You may proceed with your question. Ivan Feinseth : Thank you for taking my question. It looks like there\u2019s some really bright light at the end of this tunnel. And while there was concern in the beginning that the industry would have to heavily discount to get people back on the ship. It definitely seems not to be the case. Now, do you feel or there\u2019s any indication that there\u2019s even more shadow demand of people who are. There\u2019s a lot of people on waiting lists to get vaccinated and once people are vaccinated and then more itineraries open up that you will even see more demand for trips. Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Ivan. And thanks for the question. Look, the industry has been shut down at least one year that means 30 million that would have crews in that year having crews. And this is a finite capacity business. I can\u2019t cruise with 150% occupancy. So there\u2019s going to be a squeeze play here. That demand is going to exceed supply, especially, after the withdrawal of some 20 plus ships from the so-called North American fleet. So you got less supply, you\u2019ve got pent up demand. You\u2019ve got people with money in their pocket. I think this is just the making of a boom time for the cruise industry. And since we can\u2019t expand, supply any faster than it\u2019s coming online, pricing is what\u2019s going to dictate the day. And we\u2019re seeing it. I mean, it\u2019s astonishing to me in the 25-plus years, I\u2019ve been in this business. That given the \u2013 the fact that, travel agents are not at full strength, we\u2019re spending a fraction of what we normally spend, the bad new cycle of lockdowns and pandemics and travel restrictions and quarantine that business is as robust as it is, not only in volume, but we\u2019re able to tick up prices. So when we say that we just do a couple of connect the dots here, 40% of FCC have been redeemed. Those FCC had a 25% premium on them. That we are at a flat to slightly ahead of pricing of the all time high pricing, including the diluted effect of those 125% FCC and that we are so well booked into the future. I mean, I\u2019ve never seen such a positive set of circumstance. We just need to get back to work. We need to get cruising, operating again. And we\u2019re hopeful look, as much as it bothers me to see other sectors of the travel community open, I\u2019m happy for them. Trust me, I\u2019m happy for the casino operators and the airlines and the hotel operators and the resorts. I want to be happy for us as well. And I think our day should be approaching, should be approaching. I\u2019ve been given the advances we\u2019re making in the vaccine front, prevalence is coming down. The industry, the protocols we put in place, no other sector of the travel business or any other business has put forth as many comprehensive protocols to combat spread of the virus as we have. And we\u2019re eager to get back work, and we\u2019re happy to see it starting in Asia, starting in Europe. We\u2019re going to see, I think more vessels starting in Europe soon. And so we\u2019re encouraged by all those developments, but at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to get back to work soon and we\u2019re ready. We\u2019re all ready. Thank you. Ivan Feinseth : And also, when the CD you, right now, you\u2019re planning on 50% capacity, but working with your Healthy Sail Panel, do you feel once people are vaccinated and comfortable that ramping up capacity quickly, because in a cruise ship, you\u2019re kind of interacting with a lot of people and whether you\u2019re at 50% or even 75% capacity. That\u2019s not going to be the determining factor. The factor is people just being vaccinated. Frank Del Rio : That\u2019s right. Ivan Feinseth : And it is allowing you to get to a higher level of capacity faster. Frank Del Rio : Look, I agree. I think we all knew that vaccinations were ultimately going to be the deciding factor. And the quicker we vaccinate where we get to the point of herd immunity, which by most accounts, that timeframe is in the July, August time. So sometime in summer, the experts believe that by the end of April, anyone who wants a vaccine, at least in the United States, even in Europe, Canada can \u2013 will have access to one that all bodes well. But look, one step at a time. We just have to start \u2013 we have to start, we have to build momentum, we have to demonstrate to government agencies, society as a whole, our guests, our crew into ourselves that we can de facto operate safely in a low prevalence environment, where crew and guests are vaccinated. And then this will pivot from being a pandemic to being an endemic. And that\u2019s what we have today with the flute. This will be you listen to the experts. That\u2019s what they say that this pandemic will pivot to being a seasonal event. And it won\u2019t be the scary thing that it is today. Ivan Feinseth : Very good. Thank you. And good luck. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Ivan. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Ivan. Operator : Frank Del Rio : And thank you everyone. We truly appreciate your calling today, your questions, your continued support for our great industry and our great company. And I look forward to speaking to you coming May. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time.  As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Josh, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we discuss our results, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2021 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures contained in our earnings release and presentation. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As always, I hope that all of you joining us today, as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made thus far towards the resumption of cruising, the overall strength of the booking and pricing environment and our efforts to bolster our liquidity and maximize financial flexibility, as we've methodically returned our fleet to operation. Over a year since this suspension of voyages worldwide, our team in Norwegian has accelerated that the time has finally come to where we shift our focus to what I like to call, our Great Cruise Comeback, even if the comeback starts from international ports. As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around three key phases. First, we developed our multi-layered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan and our return \u2013 and our planned return to cruising later this summer. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel, with the significant progress we have made in recent months on our return to cruising. Despite this positive momentum, we have not lost sight that the pandemic is not yet over, and we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all levers available to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility in what is an improving, but still uncertain environment. As I've said before, our team is focused on what we can control and we continue to adapt our strategy as needed as the pandemic evolves. Slide 10 illustrates the three focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the first quarter. First, we continue to tightly control operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the significant reduction or outright deferral of near-term demand generating marketing expenses and non-essential capital expenditures. As an example, our non-new build capital expenditures continue to be less than half our pre-pandemic expectations for 2021. In addition, we finalized \u20ac50 million of incremental deferrals of new build related shipyard payments since our last earnings call, resulting in a total deferral of \u20ac270 million through the end of the second quarter 2022. Second, we have made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile to provide additional near-term financial flexibility. In March, we repaid the Pride of America and Norwegian Jewel facilities, which were set to mature in 2022, leaving no significant debt maturities until 2024. We also worked with our lenders to amend certain credit agreements to free up approximately $2 billion of additional debt capacity, most of which is on an unsecured basis. While we believe our liquidity position today is strong, this incremental debt capacity meaningfully improves our financial flexibility and gives us additional optionality should the need arise. And the final focus of area of our action plan is securing additional capital. We successfully tapped the market, which resulted in an approximately $1 billion of incremental liquidity in the quarter. Slide 11 illustrates the two highly successful capital market transactions executed in March. First, we issued $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of $575 million tack on to the December unsecured notes offering and $525 million of new unsecured notes due 2028. These transactions generated approximately $650 million of incremental liquidity after repaying the Norwegian Jewel and Pride of America facilities, both of which were to mature in 2022. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. And before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which is reflected on Slide 15. Despite the current public health challenges we face our commitment to drive a positive impact on society and the environment to the advancement of our ESG strategy remains at the core of our everyday operations. Throughout the crisis, we have remained committed to supporting our local communities and the destinations we visited. Earlier this week, we announced that we are providing a $10 million cash support to six Alaskan port communities to help families and small businesses with basic relief programs in the localities that really impacted by the ongoing cruise suspensions. My heart breaks for Alaska and its wonderful people as we face a potential second year of zero or at best limited cruise operations during the all-important summer tourism season, which would bring it another blow to Alaska's hard hit tourism economy. We are doing everything in our power to resume cruising in the U.S. as soon as possible. So we can provide additional much needed relief to this important region. In addition, we also joined the Shop Local Alaska program, which is a joint initiative between buyAlaskaandvoyage.com to encourage the supportive severely impacted small businesses in Alaska. This virtual platform allows consumers live around the globe to browse and purchase a wide range of items from virtual Alaska shops. In our local Miami community, we provided $100,000 with a Visa gift cards to the cruise members of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association Local 1416, who saw over 60% of their business wiped out nearly overnight with the suspension of cruise voyages. We were proud to support this pillar of the local communities, which has been providing longshore labor to port Miami for over 85 years and holds their historic position as the oldest black union in Florida. As part of our ongoing humanitarian efforts and in the spirit of giving back, we also provided more than $2 million of in-kind humanitarian relief to support various community organizations worldwide throughout 2020 and 2021. This support was directed to a variety of efforts including local food banks, disaster relief and COVID-19 recovery efforts. In addition, in celebration of teacher appreciation week on Monday, we re-launched our Giving Joy contest which provides educators with 100 free cruises and a chance to win up to 25,000 cash awards for their schools. Throughout this unprecedented period, countless teachers have worked tirelessly to give their all to their students, and we believe now more than ever, they deserve our recognition and gratitude. On the environmental front, we are honored to receive the prestigious 2021 AGC  Build America Merit Award for environmental enhancement for our newly constructed double ship pier at Ward Cove in Ketchikan Alaska. Through this project, we were able to transform Ward Cove a superfund site into a sustainable, environmentally friendly and entertaining site for the local community and cruise visitors alike. Going forward, we continue to be focused on enhancing our ESG disclosures to provide additional transparency. And I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are putting health and safety at the forefront of our return to service plan as demonstrated by our science-backed SailSAFETM health and safety program, which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew in addition to comprehensive protocols. We will continue to work with our expert advisors to evolve these protocols over time with the latest science and technology development. We are focused on our Great Cruise Comeback with our phase voyage resumption plans, both within and outside of U.S. ports. At the same time, we are keeping our longer-term strategic and financial priorities in focus. As we execute on our recovery plans. And lastly, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising across all three of our award winning brands with very positive booking and pricing trends for 2022 and beyond. Overall, I am more hopeful today than when I spoke with you last. I can't thank enough our dedicated and passionate team members around the globe for all their hard work and perseverance, which has brought us to this critical point and which will propel us forward. We still have a long road to full recovery ahead of us, but we are optimistic and encouraged by the progress we have recently made to a assumption of cruising, as well as the continued robust demand we are seeing from our loyal guests. We can't wait to get back to what we do best, providing guests with incredible experiences and lifetime memories and our shareholders with industry leading financial in year-over-year improved financial results. And with that, Josh, please let's open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Our first question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Grambling : Thanks. Good morning. I guess a quick clarification on pricing. If we look at the individual ship brands, what are you seeing in pricing both including and excluding FCCs? Frank Del Rio : Hi Steve, good morning. They're up, and they're up sequentially, we raised prices beginning \u2013 at the beginning of the second quarter. And I'm just amazed at how much pricing power we actually have, given the difficulties that we all know about and the relatively low marketing spend that we have put out in the last quarter and a half or so. And so it's \u2013 you hear about inflation, inflation means prices go up and it's good to see that we too are seeing the positive side of inflation, which is pricing power, so we're very pleased with that. Stephen Grambling : And I guess as a follow-up, since you mentioned the inflation, there is obviously been a lot of talk of labor shortages in the hospitality industry, but of course you have a bit of a different labor model. So I'm curious as you start prepping for resume sailing, what are you seeing on the labor front and how should you \u2013 how should investors generally be thinking through the puts and takes between inflation versus the efficiency actions on your overall cost structure? Frank Del Rio : Yes, and we were just talking about it before the call. Over 95% of our crew are non-American nationals. So we're not seeing any kind of pressure on the labor side. The biggest issue on labor for us getting the crew back on the ships is the various travel restrictions that still exist around the world, Visa's, consulates and embassies are slow initialing, Visa, the situation in India now we all know about, and then of course we've committed to 100% vaccination of crew. So putting the crew together with a vaccine these are all challenges that may impact our ability to stand up shifts in the future. But we don't really believe that it will with vaccines coming on \u2013 the surplus of vaccines now coming on pretty strong around, at least around the U.S., we feel that we'll be able to stand up the vessels on a pretty good clip. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. Thanks. I'll go to the Florida, looking back out there. Frank Del Rio : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Brandt Montour : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Frank, I was hoping you could pine a little further on the CDCs announcement yesterday. And wondering if you thought that the spirit of the update from them was aligned with the CDCs own goal of getting, you guys sailing back in July and then specific to your comment, which parts of the CSO, which I know may not apply to you in the end. Did you think were more rocky or steeper than expected? Frank Del Rio : Look, I think everybody has the same goal of getting the industry back in operation. The CDC themselves have stated that cruising or any activity cannot be zero risk. They've acknowledged that vaccines is the game changer, that's why society is racing towards vaccinations as fast as possible, which is why we proposed the CDC back on April 5, an iron clad multi-prong approach to the situation, which is everyone on board has to be vaccinated. So I have to tell you that I am disappointed at first read, I'm going to give the CDC an opportunity to expand and clarify, we have a call with them this afternoon on some of their requirements, for example, as we read yesterday's pronouncements, even though everyone on board would be vaccinated, in between bites of your meal and in between sips of your beverage, you have to put on your mask, take off your mask. So nobody should order soup because your mask might get sloppy. So that's to me is just preposterous, it's not in the spirit of where the country is heading, were President Biden wants to open the country, 70% of American adults will be vaccinated by the beginning of the third quarter. So we hope we're reading it wrong, we hope that there would be clarification. Quite frankly, we're hoping that these \u2013 some of these more onerous requirements in Phase 2b only applied to cruises or ships or brands or companies that are not going to vaccinate 95% of passengers and 98% of crew as mandated by the CDC. We hope that if you do get to 95%, 98%, or even better the 100% that Norwegian is proposing, that there won't be a need for such impractical onerous burdensome requirements. So we'll see what happens over the next few days as we engage with them \u2013 reengage with them on these particular phases. But certainly on first read, we were disappointed. Brandt Montour : That's really helpful. Thanks for that. And then a follow-up maybe an impossible hypothetical. But if everything went well from here on out with the CDC in the very near-term, like you get those positive revisions you're looking for in the July. It looks like the July is going to happen best case scenario. And again, you find this out let's say tomorrow, best case scenario, how many additional ships do you think you could launch for July in the U.S.? Frank Del Rio : None. I mean, the July U.S. launch at least from our company, it's just not possible. It was possible back in early April, when we proposed to the CDC 100% vaccination, we've always said it takes about 90 days to stand up a vessel. So from April 5, when we submitted our proposal 90 days would have been early July and that was possible, but today we're in early May, so now we're looking past that. But look there is more to it than just what the CDC says, there is only so much capacity to be able to stand up vessels. We \u2013 standing up a vessel after a 15, 18 month cold layup is not an overnight exercise. It takes a while and making it more complicated as the travel restrictions for crew, the vaccination mandates that we are imposing for crew. So we are focused on standing up our first five vessels that we've announced \u2013 first six vessels that we've announced for Norwegian ocean and region outside the U.S., as you know, we the industry, we our company regularly operate vessels outside the U.S., especially in the summer season where Europe is the big drop. And so July, August, September is summer and the best and highest use for our vessels is to operate in Europe, and that's what we're doing. In a couple of occasions, we are standing up vessels in the Caribbean, because the CDC up to now has not given us a pathway. We'll see how things progress over time. But remember it is a seasonal industry and outside of Alaska, which is in doubt, not only because of the CDC, but because of the Canadian situation. Outside of Alaska, the world\u2019s cruise leads are typically outside of the U.S. in the summertime, we're cruising elsewhere, we're cruising primarily in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, et cetera. So seasonality plays a big role as well the final CDC regulations will play a big role. Mark Kempa : And Brandt, as we've always said, we're not in a race. We want to do this properly, we want to instill confidence in our passengers, our guests, all of our constituents. So we want to do it in a methodical manner, and it's important that we just start the momentum going, that's the key. Brandt Montour : Got it. Thanks for that guys and good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. Steve Wieczynski : Hey guys, good morning. So Frank, I guess I'm a little bit confused here. I mean, you guys have already indicated at all of your guests and all your crew are going to have to be vaccinated. So \u2013 am I not reading this right from the CDC yesterday that, you would be able to skip the simulated cruises and be able to start North American cruising sooner rather than later. And, if you did go down the path of participating in the simulated cruises for certain ships that don't meet those vaccine mandates, do you believe that 60 day wait period would still be in place, or would that get accelerated? Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Steve. We're going to have one rule and one rule only, and that is at least at the beginning, 100% of our guests and our crew will be vaccinated. We're not going to pick and choose that this ship is less safe than another ship, it's one rule covers everyone, whether you're sailing in Europe, sailing out of the Caribbean or sailing out of the U.S. So, I really haven't paid too much attention to the latest simulated voyages, because we don't plan on participating in that program. We're going to be fully vaccinated and therefore we won't have to. So I just \u2013 I don't know the answer to your question in terms of timing. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And let me ask this a little bit differently then. So you obviously have been in front of the CDC and you've had conversations with the CDC, and I'm sure you've asked this question to them. But, how can they differentiate between you guys? And let's take, for example, the airline industry. So if I'm going in an airline, I don't have to be vaccinated, there is no social distancing requirements, if I go on a cruise line on one of your ship, everybody is going to be vaccinated. How \u2013 what is the answer to that question in terms of how they're differentiating there? Frank Del Rio : Steve, you just threw a piece of red meat at me. I \u2013 listen, they just won't answer it. We\u2019re perplexed or flabbergasted, we're outrages, airplanes, casinos just about every venue. And when we talk about \u2013 we're willing to vaccinate every single person aboard the cruise ship. There isn't another venue on earth, not a school, not a factory, not your office building, apartment building much less an entertainment venue like a casino, hotel or resort that can make that claim. We will have \u2013 we will be the safest place on earth by definition. On top of that vaccination mandate, we're going to implement the 74 healthy sail panel recommendation, that one, two punch is unbeatable, no one on earth has it, yet the CDC continues to treat us differently, we dare to say unfairly. And look, it's not like the CDC has done a great job of controlling the virus around the country. We ranked number one in the world for the most infections, the most hospitalization, I think the most deaths, yet they pick on the cruise industry to an extreme that is just unbelievable, unexplainable and frustrates us and no one. We're hopeful that the discussions that we've been having lately with them, these two times a week calls will result in continued improvement. We saw improvement, when they announced last Wednesday night, clarifications to the original Phase 2a, we're certainly going to let them know this afternoon that what they published for a Phase 2b and Phase 3 is unacceptable in many areas. And that we're again, hopeful at this point, I can't say more than hopeful that clarifications will come soon to alleviate the pain points that we've identified. Steve Wieczynski : And if I could ask one more quick one for, probably for Mark. Mark, whether you started North American cruising, July, August, September, whatever timeframe, obviously you're going to have some operations around Europe and other parts of the Caribbean in the near-term. I guess the question mark is, your current liquidity position, do you feel that it's pretty adequate at this point, meaning you feel comfortable enough with where you sit today? Mark Kempa : Hi, Steve. Look, we have a very solid liquidity position today, almost $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter. So we have \u2013 we feel like we have a great foundation going forward, we still have a sufficient amount of tools in our toolbox, should we need it? But the key really is, we have to stay ahead of our needs, but the key is that they're still relatively uncertain, there is a lot of uncertainty out there. So we have to watch that while we're certainly encouraged with the recent momentum and the discussions that have taken place and with the restart that certainly bodes well for us and the rest of the industry. So we just need to see that continued momentum going forward. But we do have tools should we need it, but we feel we're in a very strong position as we sit here today. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. You may proceed with your questions. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning, everyone. Frank, you had talked about we\u2019re having a complete vaccinations to start with out of the U.S. overcoming a hurdle with the CDC, however you have Florida prohibiting customers and patrons of businesses providing any documentation regarding certifying a COVID-19 vaccine. How do you plan to deal with that Florida law in this situation? Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Yes. That's an issue, Patrick. We\u2019ve had discussions with the Governor's office, those continue. But it is a classic state versus Federal Government issue. Legally, lawyers believe that federal law applies and not state law, but I'm not a lawyer. And we hope that this doesn't become a legal football or a political football. But at the end of the day, cruise ships have motors, propellers and rudders, and God forbid we can operate in the state of Florida for whatever reason, then there are other states that we do operate from. And we can operate from the Caribbean for ships that otherwise would've gone to Florida. We certainly hope that doesn't come to that. Everyone wants to operate out of Florida, it's a very lucrative market, it's close drive market. So \u2013 but it isn't an issue, can't ignore it. And we hope that everyone is pushing in the same direction, which is, we want to resume cruising in a safe manner, especially at the beginning. Things might be different six months from now or a year from now, but today with the pandemic still being front and center in everybody's mind. And we're just getting out of the worst part of it just weeks ago. I think everyone should be wanting to start cruising in the safest possible manner. And that's exactly what the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings plan does a 100% vaccination of both crew and passengers for the life of me. I don't understand 98% and not a 100% percent. So you have a big ship. You have 1,800 crew members on board, and you're going to vaccinate 1,764 of them, but not 36. I mean, what a loophole to allow potential COVID to be introduced in the crew area. 100%, at least at the beginning, I believe should be the model. And if the CDC wants to go in a different direction, the rest of the industry wants to go \u2013 great, we want to go 100%. We want clearance for 100%. And as of today, which is a little over a month since we submitted our proposal to the CDC, we've not yet heard back from them. And that is very disappointing. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you for that detailed answer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Robin Farley : Thank you. Like everyone else, I have questions about the restart and timing, but I know that there aren't all the answers. So I actually, I'm going to ask a question. One of the slides talking about the recovery plan, it mentioned private island infrastructure and even ahead of maybe some de-leveraging. So I'm just wondering if something related to the reopening plan that is you felt you needed, given there may be initially limited to private islands and just kind of wanted to hear what that reference may be. Thanks. Mark Kempa : Hi, Robin. It's Mark. So look, that as we look at our path going forward in our plans, medium, long-term. Certainly, obviously de-levering is a critical component of what we want to do. And we're continuously be looking at that. When we talk about our islands and our infrastructure, we've been talking about this for a while that we believe the private islands are a unique destination that we can continue to monetize in a positive economic way. That said, we are not targeting anything with our comeback, where it would force us to have significant CapEx around that. We're simply keeping on our radar that as we recover and as we rebuild, those are opportunities where we can invest and see a significant return on. So I wouldn't read too much into it, but as we go forward, we're going to balance all needs, whether it's de-levering, trying to take out some debt, investing in the fleet, investing in our islands, investments to become more efficient. That's all going to be in our playbook and we'll balance the needs accordingly. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Katz with Morningstar. You may proceed with your question. Jamie Katz : Hi, good morning. I don't think you guys have mentioned the demand that you've seen on the three ships that you put into the Caribbean and announced last month. So if there's any insight into how pent-up demand has played out for those itineraries, I'd love to hear it. And then I do think the sourcing of cruisers has been a little bit more geographically homogeneous for some of the other cruise lines and what they have currently announced in Europe. So are there any logistical difficulties we should be thinking about when you're sourcing across geography is, or because of the vaccination requirement? Is that not as much a problem? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Yes. Thank you, Jamie. Your first question all three of the initial sailings, we announced for Norwegian, one vessel out of Athens for the Greek Isles doing incredibly well. And to tie that with your second question consistent with our prior history, a little over 80% of the people who are booked on those cruises out of Greece are American. So Americans are willing to get on an airplane and fly over there. The two sailings out of the Caribbean are doing better than expected. Remember that normally Caribbean sailings out of Miami, out of South Florida, this is the low season. So we have two shifts. We normally have one. So the unrelative terms, they're not going to be the highest producing vessels in terms of yields, but given what we expected, they were doing better than expected, especially given the fact that we introduced them only about a month ago. And so the booking window is very, very compressed, but again, speaking to the pent-up demand, it's filling up quickly. And so I'm glad we did it, it certainly beat keeping the ship laid up. But we would have preferred to start those vessels in Alaska, start those vessels in Europe. But because of other reasons that you know of, we couldn't until the next best thing was to start new home ports. And we'll see what happens. We're very encouraged, especially with the vessel out of the Dominican Republic. The DR has a very good airlift to the U.S. I believe it's a number one destination for Americans to the Caribbean and who knows that vessel might prove to be so profitable there, that it never returned back to U.S. waters, which would be again, one of the economic casualties of this prolonged CDC induced suspension. Jamie Katz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. You may proceed with your question. Vince Ciepiel : Hi, thanks. Question on longer-term supply/demand dynamics pre-COVID, there was concern in the industry of elevated capacity additions, limited pricing power based on what you're seeing today with scrapping or delaying of the scheduled arrivals, how much lower do you think industry capacity ends up shaking out over the next couple of years? And what are you seeing early on right now for longer dated sailings in 2022 and 2023? And how does that shape your view of industry pricing going forward? Frank Del Rio : So that's nine questions in one. I'll try to remember them. Look, I think that the narrative of too much capacity coming online pre-pandemic had pretty much been debunked. All the cruise industries were taking on the new delivery, digesting that new capacity very nicely and increasing pricing. And so we always \u2013 our comeback always was, we only have 28 ships. There are many unserved \u2013 underserved markets that we simply don't have shifts to operate in. And so we're eager to get our hands on our new vessels, all nine of them across the three brands. And what we're seeing now with in the pandemic is pricing is strong, demand is stronger than ever. I mean, to give you a nugget of data. The Oceania and Regent brands reached their 50% load factor for 2022 over 100 days earlier than they did for the record year of 2019. Nearly four months, they hit their 50% load factor mark earlier than ever before and at higher prices. So, pricing power is there. In terms of capacity exits, I think from what I can see, and I don't know because different companies, you've got to ask any individual company, but from what I can see, the capacity exits that have already occurred. We have the youngest fleet in the industry. So we never considered any exits and still having. And the order book in the future hasn't changed. So they're coming with very, very few delays and whatever is delayed is delayed by a few weeks, a month or so. So look, the industry was healthy as heck before the pandemic. We're seeing during the pandemic, how resilient it is, how much pent-up demand there is. We just need to get started. We just need to get all these ridiculous regulations, this overreach eliminated. And I'll tell you this, if we could operate given what's on the books right now for 2020, if we can operate the itineraries that we're actually selling, 2022 could be a record year. That's how good things are, but the big risk is, can we operate? Are we going to have to continue to cancel sailings because of this rolling conditional sale order, which is very difficult to comply with. And it's not just the CDC, let's say, let me try to be a little fair here. The rest of the world has got to open up as well. The CDC affects U.S. embarking, disembarking guests, but the rest of Europe has to open up. Asia has to open up, South America has to open up. Remember this is a global industry, cruise companies visit 500 ports around the world, and only a handful are open today. And so that's the risk. How quickly can the world return to normal to opening up the ports, lifting the travel restrictions, et cetera. But from a pure market dynamic point of view, 2022 would be a record year. Vince Ciepiel : That's really helpful. Thank you. Andrea DeMarco : And Josh, we have time for one last question for you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial. You may proceed with your question. Ivan Feinseth : Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on fighting this good fight and almost getting there. Just a kind of a couple of quick questions. Do you think that the demand is even greater than you're experiencing? Because a lot of people may be hesitant to book, but once they know they can book and the rules are clear that you will see maybe travel agents are saying, I have a bunch of people ready to book once it's a ready to go. And also what \u2013 which ones of your lines are seeing the strongest demand and the best pricing. And then one last thing, a lot of the travel industry has started to embrace the concept. That's been driven by a certain company that books houses as working from home doesn't have to be your home and the work from anywhere. It can be anywhere. And maybe there's an opportunity to address people that want to work from anywhere, including a cruise ship from time to time would be a great place to work. Frank Del Rio : Yes. I don't know. I think that's a little fatty. And then when you work from home, because you have this incredible fast internet service, as you know, internet service on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean is not optimal. So I wouldn't get too carried away on that one, Ivan. Look, in terms of overall demand, we're hitting only on partial cylinders. The U.S. is by far the biggest driver of new demand. Even though we have 50,000 cases a day and all the restrictions that we still have to live with and the news cycle and everything else. Europe for the most part has not reopened in terms of robust marketing and travel agencies coming back, the UK is doing okay, Australia, New Zealand, which is, I think you know, has always been number three, number four, top source market for us is completely closed down. So the fact that we're doing as well as we're doing. With marketing spend, that is in the neighborhood of 30% to 40% of what we normally spend. The new cycle, the travel restrictions, the unknown, right, we're just not sure what's going to be happening. There is no certainty, the international source markets for the most part been sub-optimal. I mean, like I said, in my prepared remarks, the pent-up demand is deep, 50 million people. By the time summer rolls around, 33 million people cruise a year, we will have been shut down 18 months. That's 50 million people that wouldn't have \u2013 would have cruised that have been cruised. And so I think we have a pent-up demand tail that we're going to be able to enjoy over the next couple of years, certainly in 2022 and to 2023 and perhaps beyond because look, it's sort of like a yin and yang. We've gone with no cruising was zero. And these people want to cruise and they're going to cruise in the future. And so we believe that sets up a beautiful dynamic for increased pricing and we're taking advantage of it to be as well booked as we are. And again, I gave you a nugget that Oceania and Regent hit their 50% load factor for 2020 to over 100 days earlier than they ever had before. And their pricing is up. Even with the FCC dilution is just unbelievable. Just let me cruise CDC and we'll have incredible financial results. Just let us cruise. Mark Kempa : And Ivan, your comment on the demand, getting better. I think you're spot on, we are seeing that with data points. When we talk about our booking volumes that have doubled, we see our ATS continually growing. So as consumers get more certainty and more comfortable, I think there's good signs that should continue and continue strong. So we're very hopeful around that. Ivan Feinseth : Well, congratulations on managing this so well and really all on your own because like other industries you received so far, no help. So from hopefully we're getting there soon. So good luck. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Ivan. All the best to you. Andrea DeMarco : Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that our annual general meeting is coming up on May 20. This year, we have a number of very important proposals on the ballot, including an increase in our authorized share capital. We're extremely appreciative of the support we've received from our shareholders during this extraordinary time. And we're asking for our shareholders continued support. Please vote and support our board's recommendations for our annual general meeting proposals so that we have the flexibility to continue to respond to the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. Thank you again, everyone, for your time and support. And as always, we'll be available to answer any of your questions. Have a great day and stay well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder to all participants, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed. Andrea DeMarco : Thank you, Roshea, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  We would also like to welcome a special guest joining us today, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Former Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Chairman of our company's SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council and author of the soon-to-be-released book, Uncontrolled Spreads. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss our financial results before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions.  As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nchlltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.  Before we begin, I'd like to cover just a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2021 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website.  This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.  Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As always, I hope that all of you joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe.  Before I go into my prepared remarks, and if you haven't already heard the good news, I would like to congratulate Andrea on her new appointment to Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of our luxury brand, Regent Seven Seas Cruises. After more than 30 earnings calls with our company, we will all miss her, but wish her the very best of luck in her new role. Jessica John, who many of you have already met, will assume the role of Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG beginning September 1. Congratulations, Andrea and Jessica.  I am pleased to say that we are taking this morning's call from Seattle, Washington as we prepare for a very exciting day tomorrow, the relaunch of our first ship from the United States in over 16 months.  And as Andrea mentioned, we also have a very special guest with us today, former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. After over a year of working together remotely to reach this long-awaited milestone, it is truly a pleasure to finally meet Dr. Gottlieb and the other public health experts on our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council in person and for the first time today as we kick off our grade crews come back.  Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made on our return to cruising, our comprehensive plan for the phased resumption of operations for our entire 28-ship fleet and the record-setting strength we continue to experience in consumer demand, which has translated into a record load and record pricing for calendar year 2022 and beyond.  As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around 3 key phases. First, we developed our multilayered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory FDA-, WHO- or EMA-authorized vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone. In addition, we test all guests at the terminal prior to embarkation, and all crew undergo weekly routine testing.  Next, we have now announced voyage resumption plans for all 28 ships in our fleet. And lastly, we are intently focused on the flawless execution of the phase relaunch of our fleet, which we expect to complete by April 1, 2022.  Against a still ever-changing COVID backdrop, we remain vigilant and ready to adapt as needed, keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions and any changes to the global public health environment, which could affect our planned operations. Overall, we are encouraged to see some relaxation of travel restrictions and opening of borders in recent weeks, particularly for vaccinated travelers. Just a few weeks ago, Canada moved up its plans to allow the return of cruise ships in November, 4 months earlier than previously announced. Many countries in the EU are now allowing travelers from the U.S. And in the past few weeks, both Canada and the U.K. announced entry to vaccinated travelers without quarantine.  Travel restrictions and port closures do remain in place in other parts of the world, but we are ready to execute on our cruise assumption strategy and have backup plans ready to go, which we can implement and adapt to as needed. Slide 5 details our voyage resumption plans by brand and by vessel. After 500 days, the time has finally come, and I could not be more pleased to say that our Great Cruise Comeback officially commenced last week with Norwegian Jade operating Greek Isles voyage out of Athens. The relaunch went off without a hitch and demonstrated that strict vaccination requirements, comprehensive preboarding testing and a suite of other robust protocols are working as designed to help mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels.  A special thank you goes out to the officers and crew of Norwegian Jade, who, even after 16 months of not operating, seamlessly adapted our new protocols and delivered the same exceptional service and world-class cruise experience that our guests expect from our company. As an indication of this top-notch service delivery, our onboard revenue on this first crew significantly exceeded our target, which was focused on 2019 actual results by over 50%. All of our incredible team members around the world work tirelessly to prepare for this critical moment, and I am truly grateful for the privilege to work day in and day out alongside such a dedicated passionate and talented team. I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, valued travel partners and all of our stakeholders for their patience and support during these challenging times as we ramp up our return-to-cruise plans.  Norwegian Jade's successful relaunch is just the first of many to come, including our much anticipated return to cruising in the United States. Tomorrow, Norwegian Encore, the line's newest and most innovative ship, will make her West Coast debut with a 7-night sailings to Alaska from Seattle. We are looking forward to once again bringing guests to explore the last frontier, one of the most popular destinations with our guests and providing some much-needed economic relief to the communities, families and small businesses throughout coastal Alaska, who have been devastated by the loss of cruise tourism revenue during this prolonged suspension. The next step in our relaunch plan is our return to Miami, the cruise capital of the world.  I'd like to address our request for a preliminary injunction that we filed last month, which will allow us to confirm guest vaccination status for sailings departing from the State of Florida that has been heard in a Miami Federal Court today. Combating this virus is an unprecedented historic challenge. That requires everyone, including governments at the local, state and federal levels plus private enterprise and society at large, to do their part. I have a tremendous empathy for our elected officials, business leaders, friends and families, neighbors who are all doing the best they can under enormously difficult circumstances to beat back this virus. Having had the pleasure to work in the cruise industry for nearly 30 years, I am confident that in the current global health environment and especially with the rise of the Delta variant, having a fully vaccinated and tested population on board our vessels is the best path to keeping our guests, our dedicated crew members and the peoples of the communities we visit safe from COVID. In order to do that, we must be able to confirm vaccination status of our guests at every port we sail from, including those in the State of Florida.  We owe it to all our stakeholders to do everything possible to make sure we deliver on this critical mission. We hope that the federal courts will agree with our vision and our mission.  When we say the health and safety of our guest crew and communities we visit is our #1 priority, we mean it. It is not a slogan nor a tagline. The legal actions we have taken in Florida reflect our deep commitment to resume sailing in accordance with our robust science-backed SailSAFE health and safety protocols outlined on Slide 6.  Our policy of 100% vaccinations, coupled with preboarding testing of guests and routine testing of crew is in place without issue in the nearly 500 ports we sail to and from around the world, except Florida ports. Nothing takes priority over health and safety. And we have gone to great length and expense to pursue this commitment to our guests, crew and all stakeholders. Again, this commitment is not a slogan nor a tagline. Health and safety is far and away the most important principle to guide how our company operates at all levels. And this fundamental philosophy has never been more important than right now.  We want to use every tool available to us that science and medicine have developed to prepare our ships to return to service, and vaccines are our most powerful tool.  Given that we have Dr. Gottlieb here today, who is not only a world-renowned expert, but is also the Chairman of our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, I'd like to give them the floor for his thoughts on our health and safety program. Dr. Gottlieb? Scott Gottlieb : Thank you, Frank. It's a great pleasure to be here with you today and to witness the culmination of over a year's collaboration on enhancing Norwegian's health and safety protocols. All of the scientific and medical experts on our SailSAFE Council fully support and recommend a fully vaccinated and tested population to relaunch cruising as it's the most effective way to mitigate the introduction or spread of the virus onboard a cruise ship or anywhere else in society. Even with vaccines, however, the risk can't be fully mitigated. But this approach mitigates the risk to the greatest extent possible and significantly reduces the severity of any potential breakthrough cases. While the Delta variant is fueling the current rise in cases, if the U.K. is any guide, I believe we're perhaps further into this epidemic surge. And we'll hopefully be turning a corner in the next several weeks. In fact, some of the states hardest hit by the Delta surge in the south are already showing some indication that their epidemic waves could be starting to peak. In the meantime, the vaccines are highly effective even against the Delta variant.  And Norwegian is taking the extra step of coupling vaccines with multiple additional layers of protection against COVID-19, including universal testing prior to boarding the ship. This goes well beyond what we're seeing in other travel and hospitality sectors. And with the controlled environment a cruise ship provides, it can offer one of the safest vacation options. I look forward to seeing our protocols in practice with you tomorrow on Norwegian Encore. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Dr. Gottlieb, for your insights. I, again, want to thank you and the members of the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council for all the hard work and expert guidance that you and the council have provided us. Now with our safety protocols in place and our voyage resumption plan in full swing, we'll shift a discussion to our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 7. In short, pent-up demand for cruise vacations, especially for 2022 sailings, are very strong as we have experienced record-breaking demand for future cruise vacations across all 3 of our brands.  This outsized demand is even more impressive when considering that this strength is true despite significantly reduced levels of demand-generating marketing investments and the absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners throughout the world. The unparalleled pent-up demand I speak of is demonstrated by our record book position and pricing. For full year 2022, load factor continues to be meaningfully ahead of 2019 record levels by a wide margin. And when you look at our booking curve at the same point in time versus 2 and 3 years ago, we are now booked 9 to 10 weeks ahead of those levels. Pricing is also higher than 2019's record level even when including the dilutive effect of future cruise credits. The strength we are experiencing is evident throughout 2022, but particularly strong sequentially as we move through the year and our fleet rollout is completed and becomes fully operational. In addition, approximately 75% of our booked position in 2022 is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainder comprised of future cruise credit bookings. So far, approximately 45% of our outstanding future cruise credits have been redeemed.  The strong demand is also extending beyond 2022. Last month, Regent Seven Seas Cruises easily broke the opening day booking record for its World Cruise for the third year in a row. The 2024 World Cruise, a 132-night sailing, surpassed all expectations and sold out in under 3 hours and at higher pricing than the 2023 World Cruise. Not only was this without a doubt the strongest World Cruise launch day in the line's history, but it also saw a strong increase in new-to-brand guests, which comprise approximately 1/3 of bookings. This is further evidence of the continued demand we are seeing, both from our loyal past guests and new-to-brand cruisers even for these long exotic itineraries. As I have said time and time again, the pent-up demand is real. Last quarter, we reached an inflection point in our advanced ticket sales build, which continued its positive trajectory throughout the quarter. Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $300 million on a gross basis or over 50% versus the prior quarter's builds.  As we begin phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this momentum to continue to accelerate sequentially. As we look to the future, the growth opportunity we have planned for as we emerge from this crisis is impressive. In May, Norwegian Cruise Line unveiled Norwegian Prima, the first of 6 Prima Class ships, which marked the first new class of vessels for the brand in nearly a decade. Debuting in summer 2022, Norwegian Prima, which you can see a rendering of on Slide 8, is absolutely stunning, offering the most outdoor deck space of any new cruise ship, including more total pool deck space than any other ship in the lines fleet as well as multiple infinity pools and vast outdoor walkways. She will also take the line's groundbreaking ship-within-a-ship concept with the haven to the next level.  Most importantly, however, she is resonating with guests unlike any other new ship launch we have ever seen before. Her sales debut in May hit a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018 and at prices approximately 20% higher than Bliss commanded. Turning to Slide 9. We also had an exciting announcement from Regent Seven Seas Cruises, which unveiled the name of its newest ship, Seven Seas Grandeur, the sixth ship in the world's most luxurious fleet. Seven Seas Grandeur will host 750 guests and is a sister ship to Seven Seas Explorer and Seven Seas Splendor. There are more reveals to come leading after her launch in the fourth quarter of 2023 with her inaugural season set to be unveiled and open for reservations next month.  As you can see on Slide 10, we have an industry-leading growth profile with 9 ships coming online through 2027. These newbuilds represent approximately 24,000 additional berths, growing our fleet by approximately 40%. In 2023, when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019 prepandemic levels with the benefit not only of our 4 2022 and 2023 newbuilds, but also a full year of both Norwegian Encore, which joined the fleet in November of 2019 and Regent Seven Seas Splendor, which launched in February 2020.  With a smaller footprint of 28 ships in our fleet, the addition of our new 9 ships strongly positions us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate unserved and underserved markets globally, which is expected to drive meaningful growth to both the top and bottom lines.  As Slide 11 clearly demonstrates, our excellent track record speaks for itself in our ability to successfully absorb capacity and turn that capacity growth into outsized revenue EBITDA and net cash flow growth. Our new ships are expected to be accretive to earnings into cash flow, and I expect our historical industry-leading performance to continue in the years to come with the addition of our new ship deliveries.  I'll be back later to provide and an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. Our remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan, our liquidity profile and our all-important phased voyage resumption plan. I am pleased with the significant progress we've made on our return to cruising.  As Frank mentioned, we are here in Seattle ready to relaunch Norwegian Encore tomorrow. We have a comprehensive voyage resumption plan in place and are focused on the execution of this phased relaunch.  We expect to have 8 ships, representing approximately 40% of our total capacity, operating by the end of the third quarter and 17 ships, representing approximately 75% of our capacity, by year-end. The last ship, Oceana's Nautica, will emerge better than new after an extensive dry dock and reinspiration and join the rest of the fleet on April 1, 2022.  While we've reached several important milestones in our road to recovery, we recognize that the global health environment is still fluid. So we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all available levers to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility as we execute our relaunch plan. As you can see on Slide 12, since the halt in global cruise operations in March of 2020, we worked quickly to implement our COVID-19 financial action plan. During the pause in operations, we successfully reduced operating expenses by nearly 60% and capital expenditures by over 75%.  As we ready our ships to return to service, costs will increase as expected. But we will do so in a strategic and disciplined manner to balance our cash needs while maintaining a strong liquidity profile.  Since the beginning of the second quarter, we've taken several additional proactive measures on our financial action plan. We continue to significantly reduce or defer near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and nonessential capital expenditures.  In July, we amended 9 credit facilities for our newbuild program to increase the commitments by approximately $770 million to cover owner supply costs, modification costs and financing premium fees. We want to thank our banking partners for their continued support of our company during these extremely challenging times.  Turning to our liquidity and cash burn on Slide 13. We had approximately $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. This provides us with significant financial flexibility to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on a return-to-service plan.  As for cash burn for the second quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $200 million per month. This was slightly higher than our guidance of $190 million driven by the announcement of additional ship relaunches in our voyage resumption plan and the associated restart expenses.  As for the third quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn rate to increase to approximately $285 million as restart expenses accelerate with additional vessels entering service. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning and stopping of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. Note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as voyages resume, while at the same time, balancing the need to drive new cash bookings.  Looking ahead, based on our resumption plan, we expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive over the course of the first quarter of 2022.  To assist with modeling, Slide 22 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures.  Turning to Slide 14. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash. Our cash balance in the second quarter decreased driven primarily by approximately $600 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $150 million and net working capital and other outflow of approximately $10 million, which includes health and safety investments.  Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that as we continue to navigate through this crisis and relaunch our fleet over the next few quarters, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our relaunch milestones bring us one step closer to executing on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan as outlined on Slide 15 and to rebuild and continue to drive margin expansion, maximize cash flow generation and optimize our balance sheet.  With that, I'll hand the call back to Frank to provide closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, shown on Slide 16. This summer, we reached several key milestones on our ESG journey starting with the publication of our first comprehensive ESG report, which included disclosures aligning with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB index.  This was a significant step forward in our efforts to enhance our transparency. And I encourage you all to take a look at the report, which is on our website if you haven't done so already. We also unveiled our redesigned Sail & Sustain program, which is structured around 5 pillars developed through cross-functional collaboration with key internal and external stakeholders. The pillars include reducing environmental impact, sailing safely, empowering people, strengthening our communities and operating with integrity and accountability.  In addition, we have aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and have identified 10 goals where we believe we can make the greatest contribution to achieve a more sustainable future for all. In conjunction with the report, we have also developed a new sustainability website, which we will use to continue to provide critical disclosure to all of our stakeholders.  On the environmental front, we were pleased to announce our newly created long-term climate action strategy and our goal to reach carbon neutrality. This ambitious program is centered around 3 key action areas, including reducing carbon intensity; identifying and investing in technologies, including exploring alternative fuels; and implementing a carbon offset program.  We continuously seek opportunities to reduce our overall footprint by minimizing fuel consumption. And in fact, our ongoing investments in systems and technologies have resulted in a reduction of fuel consumption per capacity day of approximately 17% from 2008 to 2019 for our entire 28-ship fleet.  With the introduction of our 9 new and more fuel-efficient vessels through 2027, we expect to see further improvement in our intensity rates. In addition to ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions rate, we have committed to purchasing high-quality verified carbon credits to offset 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over a 3-year period beginning last year. This is a measurable step in the near-term emissions reductions, which will help bridge the gap in our decarbonization efforts until new technologies become available.  Our 3 million-ton commitment is sizable. To put it in perspective, it is the equivalent of over 7.5 billion miles driven by an average passenger car. And we plan to increase offset purchases in future years to help us reach our goal of carbon neutrality.  We are very proud of the progress we have made so far in ESG, and we are committed to making a lasting impact on the world as responsible corporate citizens and ESG leaders. I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey.  Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, we are putting health and safety at the forefront of our return to service as demonstrated by the great length we are taking to resume cruising in the safest manner possible with our universal mandatory vaccination and preboarding testing policy across our 3 brands.  Our Great Cruise Comeback has commenced, and we are focused on the flawless execution of our phased voyage resumption plan with a target to have our full fleet in operation by April 1, 2022. We continue to experience strong future demand for cruising with very positive booking and pricing trends for 2022 and beyond.  And lastly, as we emerge from the pandemic and focus on our longer-term prospects, we have an attractive and well-thought out growth profile, which we expect will provide a meaningful boost to our financial results and shareholder value in the coming years.  Overall, while we still have a long road to full recovery ahead of us, we are encouraged by the significant milestones we have reached in recent days on return to cruising. Tomorrow, we will take another monumental step forward with our official U.S. relaunch. And I look forward to getting back to what we do best, providing exceptional vacation experiences and lifetime memories for our guests.  And with that, we can open the call for questions. Andrea DeMarco : Before we take our first question, we ask that you please refrain from asking any questions regarding pending litigation. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this regard as we will not be commenting any further. Roshea, please take the first question. Operator : . Your first question from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : Yes. So you clearly now have a nice road map as to when the full fleet will be back in service. And I guess the question is, if you stay on that path that you're on right now, let's say you get your target 60% of your capacity back in service by the end of the year, Mark, I think I heard you correctly that by 1Q, you would be in that kind of breakeven standpoint. I want to make sure I heard that right. And then maybe what goes into -- what are some of the assumptions that you're making to kind of get to that level? Mark Kempa : Steve, thank you for the question. So you're absolutely correct. Based on our -- first, let's talk about our voyage resumption plan. As you know, we've been very disciplined. We've been very methodical, and we've said we are not interested in being the first to the race to launch our vessels. We think we have a very measured and disciplined plan with approximately 75% to  80% of our fleet in operation by year-end.  And as a result of that, when we look at our cash flow, both the inflows and just the regular operating contribution from each of our vessels, yes, we expect to be cash flow positive sometime over the course of the first quarter of 2022. And that's only -- to put that in perspective, that's 5 to 6 months away.  So we're very pleased with the booking trends that we've seen. Obviously, as we restart and our ships enter service, that starts to generate that cash flywheel that we've been talking about. So we're very pleased. We don't think -- with anything, there's always a little bit of risk out there. But based on our measured plan, we think we have a solid game plan of returning to cash flow-positive operations. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. And then, Frank, I want to ask about all the changes that we've seen. It's been going on with the operators over the last week or so. I mean, we've seen changes in terms of  your peers around mask mandates, the requirement to get tested preboarded -- or get tested before you board. Just want to understand what do you think this does? Or what is this going to do to the psychology of the -- a cruise passenger right now? Meaning, do you think some of these folks are going to say, forget it. Let's book at a later date? Or how do you think this is affecting your customer right now? Frank Del Rio : Steve, look, it's not what we're seeing in our booking trends. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were ahead approximately 10 weeks when compared to where we were in 2018 at this time for '19, a record year.  And as you know, we at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings came out very, very early, as early as late March. And we said we're not going to cruise until it's safe to do so. And as a precursor, everybody has to be vaccinated, crew and passengers. And we haven't moved from that. We think that's a competitive advantage, quite frankly. During a pandemic, people who are willing to travel want to travel safely. And the Norwegian Cruise Line platform allows you to do that. Dr. Gottlieb spoke about it. It becomes just about the safest place on Earth, to be on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship.  And I'm glad to see my peers in the industry following suit because now they have begun to introduce at least some of the measures that we have announced early on. So to me, it is a competitive advantage. We continue -- we will continue to do the right thing. And that is to protect the health and safety of our guests and the communities we visit in every possible way we can. Operator : Your next question the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : How should we be thinking about the customer deposit inflow over the course of the restart? And as you mentioned, the restart costs moving up a little bit in the coming quarters. Should that be front-end loaded? Or should we be expecting a similar amount each quarter till fully up and running? Mark Kempa : Steve, it's Mark. So look, when we look at our customer deposits, as we said in our prepared remarks, our customer deposits increased 50% versus the prior quarter, roughly $300 million on a gross basis. So obviously, as we continue to relaunch and restart and we get closer to the voyages operating, we expect that to accelerate. So we're very, very pleased with that.  When we look at our relaunch cost, look, everything -- all the costs that we're incurring, they're normal, they're expected. You look at how many ships we're restarting over the course of the next 5 to 6 months. There's nothing out of the ordinary.  Most of -- there is going to be some onetime front-end loaded costs. Again, you're relocating whether it's 1,000 or 1,500 crew per vessel from across the globe. So you have some onetime initial cost. But that will settle. That will balance as typical.  But most importantly, as our vessels start to sail and as we've said publicly, we are -- most of our vessels are starting at either 60 and then ramping -- 60% load factor and then slowly ramping up to 80 and then hopefully to over -- back to our normal load factors in a short time. Those vessels which are operating are cash flow positive out of the gate. And that's very, very important.  And we've seen that with our first 2 initial voyages that have just been completed by Norwegian Jade. And we expect that to be the case for the coming voyages as well for the rest of the fleet. Stephen Grambling : That's super helpful. Maybe one more if I can sneak it in, which is kind of the topic du jour, but have you seen any impact, and you kind of talked about this a little bit from the Delta variant on bookings pricing more recently? And how would you think about the impact of risk if further requirements are imposed on even 100% vaccine sailing such as  otherwise? Frank Del Rio : Steve, it's Frank. Look, we have seen a modest decrease in our net new booking activity during the month of July when the Delta variant has surfaced. It is sequential. So it's more pronounced in -- for -- in year 2021 sailings, which for us is not that significant. I'm not focused on 2021. It's a transitional year.  The focus is to get the ships operating again. As Mark mentioned, very successful launch of Norwegian Jade. It went off without a hitch. We do have muscle memory. We do remember how to operate cruise vessels. The customers had a great time. Onboard revenue was through the roof. And so we are encouraged that we're off to the races.  The -- it's good that we have such a pad, so to speak, on our forward bookings to be 10 weeks ahead of our best prior year ever. It's certainly a wonderful cushion and insurance policy to have. In discussing the likely course of the Delta variant with Dr. Gottlieb, we think this is a transitory, temporary phenomenon. It's going to run through the course of the population very, very quickly. We don't think it will have lasting effects. But again, having a 10-week advance, so to speak, is certainly wonderful to have. Operator : Your next question on the line of Brandt Montour with JPMorgan. Brandt Montour : Congratulations on the official relaunching. And Mark, maybe you alluded to this in your prior comment. But I want to I want to understand, Frank, how you're thinking about occupancies. While COVID is still sort of among us and you're 100% vaccinated, can you get to a full ship under that scenario without masks? Is that safe? And is that in your plans? And has that changed at all in the last few weeks because of Delta? Frank Del Rio : Yes. As Mark mentioned, we're starting every vessel in the 60% to 70% range of load factor. That's not anyone's requirement. It's not a CDC mandate. It's something we think is a responsible way to start operations, train our crew, get our feet wet, so to speak. If all goes well, after 30 days, we'll increase that to 80% load. And after 60 days, we will resume trying to fill the vessel as in prepandemic levels.  And yes, in a fully vaccinated environment, the way that we are conducting it, where we test everyone at the pier, where we have the protocols in place, the new air filtration systems that we have spent tens of millions of dollars to upgrade throughout the fleet, we believe that we can safely operate vessels at full capacity. We will see. It will be staggered. We will learn along the way. But yes, we believe that, that can be achieved.  And by the way, and so does our sail and safety council, which they again, believe that our protocols are second to none, not just in the cruise industry, but in any kind of public environment. Mark Kempa : Yes. And Brandt, I want to just add to that, that when we look at all the measures we are taking, and you look at that vis-\u00e0-vis any other hospitality driven type venue in the world, what we're providing our customers is one of the most safest experiences that we can based on today's science and technology. So that, again, we believe that, that's an advantage for all 3 of our brands. Scott Gottlieb : Yes. And this is Scott. We feel confident that given the measures that we've taken, creating a 100% vaccinated population onboard the vessel, testing people before they enter into that environment, you can substantially reduce the risk and create a safer environment. And relative to other kinds of options people may have to engage in leisure and vacation, this becomes a much safer environment, a much more predictable environment. And we have measures on the ship, not only measures to control the risk of introduction of the virus on to the ship. We're taking significant measures to control the risk that if you do have an introduction, you're going to have secondary spread onboard the ship.  And then if you do have a case that emerges on the ship, it's -- we've tried to do our best to make it a safe environment to seek treatment, including getting some of the advanced therapeutics onboard the ships, having ICU-level care available, having procedures in place on how to offboard passengers who may become ill during the cruise. So at every step, we've tried to take every reasonable measure to create the safest possible environment for someone to engage in leisure activity. Brandt Montour : That's all great color. And then my second question is just on that metric you gave, Frank, on the onboard spend on the first ship out and up 50%. That's obviously a really impressive statistic. Is that apples-to-apples, I guess, with what you would have seen from that ship in 2019, I guess, on a per person basis, since it's going to be have a little bit less load, right, on that ship? But I guess, can you also talk about the mix on the ship of where you're seeing that consumer spend really sort of take off? Mark Kempa : Yes, Brandt, I'll take that one. So certainly, when we look at that and we look at the measure of onboard spend, while we look at it in totality on the vessel, more importantly, we're looking at a -- on a per person per day basis. So that's the measure of what the customer is willing to spend. And yes, it is on an apples-to-apples basis of a similar voyage, similar itinerary from 2019's record levels. And when you look at the mix of passengers, I think that voyage was predominantly probably the majority U.S.-based and then followed by a European-based.  And you look -- when you look at the spending trends of it, it was your normal areas. Shore ex was very intense, food and beverage and then casino. So it's great to see that we're seeing the trends that we're used to. Customers are willing to spend. While it's early, it is certainly very, very encouraging. Operator : Our next question line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Great. It sounds like deposits are building nicely, and there's an expectation to move cash flow positive at some point, maybe in the first quarter, even of 2022. Number of things going in the right direction. Can you help us think about the path and timing for deleveraging of the business? Mark Kempa : Yes. Vince, it's Mark. We are intensely focused on that. As you can recall, in 2019, we were on a path to our stated leverage of 2.5 to 2.75. We've obviously had to lever up the balance sheet as a result of this. But as we look forward, our goals right now are we want to get below 5. And then obviously, we'll look to get into the 4s.  It's a bit premature to decide or to really telegraph when we're going to get to those levels. As we've said before, if 2022 continues on the path that we're seeing today, it could be a very nice year in terms of EBITDA and subsequent cash flow generation. So that's certainly going to assist and help us with that delevering story. So we are focused on it. We have not lost sight of that because we know that's important. But right now, we're focused on relaunching and providing the best experience that we can to our customers. And if we can do that, that's going to subsequently turn into significant cash flow generation. And I will reiterate, we've said and we expect in our conservative relaunch plan, we expect to be cash flow positive over the course of the first quarter of 2022. So when you think about that from a restart within a 6-month period to be cash flow positive, we feel that's pretty tremendous. And we're pretty proud of that. So we look forward over the next few months of restarting our fleet. And again, that the cash flow that, that spins off. Vince Ciepiel : And another question. You look at the hotel industry, leisure nights, 15%, 20% ahead of '19 levels right now. Pricing in that industry is 5% ahead of 2019. When you think about the path for yield into '22 and '23, you've already kind of had a glimpse into once people get a path and the ability to go that unleashing of pent-up demand, what it can mean for pricing and other aspects of leisure. So curious, as you look out over the next couple of years, is just a little bit ahead of '19 the right way to think about it? Or could pricing be even better than that in years ahead for cruise? Frank Del Rio : I think it's better than that. It's -- if you -- I hesitate to give you any specific numbers, but when you strip out the dilutive effects of the future cruise credits, the like-for-like pricing, the pricing to the public, so to speak, is up significantly, up multiples of what our typical year-over-year growth is in yields.  And so the pent-up demand is real, and we're taking advantage of it. We do have these future cruise certificates to deal with, which will end in 2022, that these FCCs will not be dilutive at all in 2023. The FCCs have to be used by the end of 2022 or else we're going to refund the customer or whatever they paid in.  And also, remember, as I mentioned, I believe it's Slide 11, look at our future growth. We have 20% more capacity coming online through the end of '23. Look at our historic ability to absorb that growth and how we turn the capacity growth into gross revenue growth, outsized EBITDA growth and outsized net cash growth. So we're very much looking forward to taking delivery of these vessels over the next few years.  Four of them come online in '22 and '23. They're going to be accretive. They're going to be higher than the corporate average. So we believe that, that's a wonderful setup.  As Mark mentioned before the pandemic hit, NCLH was hitting on all cylinders. We were delevering to investment grade. We're going to start paying a dividend. The biggest problem we used to sit around the boardroom was, what are we going to do with all this cash? And well, we're going to start generating cash again, and that cash is first going to go to pay down debt that we took on to survive the pandemic, and then we're going to look to do what companies do : buy back stock if it's opportunistically to do so, perhaps expand the business.  We're bullish on this business. We know how to operate a cruise in this top line cruise company. We haven't forgotten how to do that over the pandemic. And we're seeing the pent-up demand from customers that allow us to do what -- exactly what we do best. So we're very much bullish on the future. Operator : Next question the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Two questions. One is if you could remind us, I know you've laid out your restart, but what percent of your ships in '21 or in the next 6 months are Florida-based for this year? And then also an expense question on -- you mentioned carbon credits. Can you sort of help us quantify what the cost of that might be your spend on carbon credits? Mark Kempa : Robin, so when we look over the next 6 months, I believe we have roughly 6 vessels that would be operating out of Florida, with the first one being Norwegian Gem on -- out of Miami on August 15. And then I think the rest come online in late -- mid- to late December.  I think the second part of your question was related to the carbon credits. We're very excited about this. This is something we're serious about. We've really taken a hard stance on our ESG efforts over the last year or 2. And we're committed to this. So we spent a few million dollars on purchasing these carbon credits. I think that, together with our other investments that we continue to make with the fleet, whether it's exhaust gas cleaning technology, waste heat recovery, we're looking at all viable investments where we can to reduce our carbon footprint.  So -- and just back to the first part, when you look at the Florida-based vessels, I believe it's about 35% to 36% of our fleet sailing out of Florida over the next 6 months. Robin Farley : Okay, great. And the carbon credit has not run through the P&L yet, right? That's -- I guess you've purchased it. It's on the balance sheet somewhere, and then that expense will run through when you're operating? Mark Kempa : Yes. That will get expensed as we consume the fuel that it's related to in a pro rata fashion over the course of the next 2 to 3 years. But again, I want to highlight that it's not a significant amount. It's a few million dollars. So it's -- you're not even going to see it when you look at our financial statements. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Jaime Katz : My questions are actually on the composition of cruisers looking forward, and given your disproportionate exposure to U.S. cruisers, what that looks like for some of the European itineraries in September and October? In addition to that, I think you guys had commented that 1/3 of the bookings for the Regent Seven Seas World Cruise was new to brand. So is there anything noteworthy that you saw in those new passengers that's different from maybe what you've seen in past passengers? Frank Del Rio : Yes. Typically, for a cruise on the Norwegian brand that operates in Europe, roughly half the customers are from the U.S., and half the customers are from the rest of the world. On the first 2 Norwegian Jade cruises to the Greek Isles out of Athens, we have seen that number jump in the neighborhood of 80%.  So many Americans have not been able to go overseas for such a long period of time that the pent-up demand that we're seeing for cruising overall is higher indexed by Americans wanting these long-haul travel plans to places like Greece. So we don't think that's sustainable in the long term, perhaps in the short to medium term as this pent-up demand is sort of burned off. But it's good to see that we have the marketing strength and the sales platforms throughout the world to be able to fill our ships. And whether it's Americans want to come over or Europeans, we're seeing strong demand across the board. Jaime Katz : And then as far as some of the debt service on the balance sheet, are you guys taking steps to maybe refi some of the operating debt that you raised early in the cycle, in the COVID cycle? Or is that something that's maybe on pause for now with a bigger focus on just restarting the fleet? Mark Kempa : Well, we're focused on all of the above. While our immediate focus, obviously, is on restarting the operations, we have not lost sight of our balance sheet and balance sheet management opportunities. So it's something we've been looking at, we continue to look at. And there is some opportunities in some of our higher-priced notes, I believe, in our 12.25 and 10.25 notes, where we have the ability to possibly have some clawback opportunities around that. So we're looking at it. We want to get our -- the most important thing for us right now is getting the vessels operating. But once we get a few vessels in the water and we have more visibility around that, I think that's what you're going to see over the course in the future is us looking at all those opportunities and exercising on some of those balance sheet management opportunities that we have. Operator : And your next question on the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush. James Hardiman : A couple of questions for me. Maybe a clarification here. So when I digest what you've said about your fleet ramp and the occupancy ramp, it kind of feels like second quarter of next year could be a pretty normal quarter. Obviously, your fleet will be back to 100%, but it seems like the expectation is that occupancy will be, at least on all but one ship, 100% plus. So is that sort of what you're targeting in terms of sort of the first normal quarter?  That seems like, Frank, you made a point earlier that you weren't so much interested in the starting line, but more so the finish line. Seems like that's maybe a little bit ahead of some of your peers. Mark Kempa : James, it's Mark. So look, I think when you look at 2022 and you look at second quarter, third quarter, we are seeing very strong bookings for those periods. But let me just go back in the time line here.  Something we just said about Norwegian Jade's first 2 voyages. Even at reduced capacity, we are seeing significant strength and significant spend on those vessels. So while our vessels are coming online over the course of the next 2 to 3 quarters, Q1, I think, is going to essentially look pretty normal as well, so to speak. Again, we do have, I think, believe it's 9 or 10 vessels that are coming on in Q1. So certainly, by the second quarter, we had to anticipate that all of our vessels or the vast majority should be back at their normal load factor levels. And if we're lucky, maybe some time sooner than that. But it's not that we don't care about '21. We've taken the stand that we want to do this right. We want to create confidence in our customers and our shareholders and our employees. And we want to make sure we're learning from all the cruises that we're launching.  So we look -- we're excited about 2022 and beyond. And -- but right now, we're focused on '21, getting all the fleet back in the water. So looking good, but we've just got to go forward in getting the ships wet again. James Hardiman : Got it. That's really encouraging. And then trying to do a little bit of math here. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. But if I think about $2.75 billion of cash, about $9 billion in net debt as we stand here today. You've said another $285 million a month of cash burn in the third quarter. Presumably, that comes down in the fourth quarter.  I'm just trying to figure out, once we get to that inflection point of cash flow positive what the balance sheet looks like? Is it in the ballpark to think that maybe another $1 billion of net debt before you hit that inflection point? Mark Kempa : Look, I think you said it right, James. If you look at the math today, we have roughly $2.8 billion. We're going to burn roughly $900 million in 3Q. But I will highlight that -- and I clearly stated that, that does not include the customer inflows that we expect from advanced ticket sales.  And as we said in our comments, we did see significant growth in the second quarter. And we expect that to ramp up, obviously, in the third and fourth quarter and first quarter. So when you do the math and you look at where our cash is today and the fact that we've stated that we expect to be cash flow positive over the course of the first quarter in 2022, you can kind of triangulate where our cash balance is going to be and the subsequent generation of cash.  So we're comfortable where our liquidity is today. We believe we have a strong foundation. We've taken significant measures to get where we are today. So as long as we can reasonably execute on our resumption -- on our voyage resumption plan, we feel that we're in a very, very strong position as we sit here today. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist. Charles Scholes : In light of the severe labor shortage situation we're seeing domestically in the United States and also problems with the supply chain for -- as it relates to basic ingredients for food, I'm wondering with your far more international company, what's the labor situation like for you folks and also the supply chain for food and beverage? Mark Kempa : Patrick, look, we're not immune to it. I think the benefit we have as a company is a lot of our -- the vast majority of our labor force, which is ship-based, comes from overseas. And quite frankly, our employees, our crew are excited and ecstatic to come back to work.  We do have collective bargaining agreements in place for most of those employees. And you have to remember that those employees, unlike other areas of the world have not, for the vast majority, received government assistance. So they are excited. They want to come back to work.  When we see employees on the vessel, they just break down in tears of joy because they have the opportunity to work again. So we don't anticipate any issues around the labor sector or the labor portion of our operating model. In terms of good old fashioned food, consumables, things of that nature, yes, we're not immune to it. We are seeing some inflationary pressure. We have started to see some of it stabilize. And we think there's -- of course, there's probably going to be some laggards in the supply chain that end up being slightly costlier.  But on the -- just as equally, there's a lot of areas where we've been able to take advantage and reprice over the last 18 months and renegotiate contracts. So we're seeing some benefit from that. So we're laser-focused on the cost side. We're not immune to it, but we're focused on it. And we think we have a good opportunity in 2022 to take advantage of some of the renegotiations we've seen. So we're looking forward to it. Frank Del Rio : Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We're -- you can see by our tone of our voice we're excited to be here in Seattle to kick off the Encore's maiden season here in -- for the Alaska season and start our cruising comeback from the U.S. Thanks very much. We'll see you next quarter. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Laurie and I will be your Operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A session, and instructions for the session will follow at that time.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications, and ESG. Ms. John, please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, Lori (ph) and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Third quarter 2021 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors.  We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2021 results was issued this morning, and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements.  These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you Jessica. And good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. And as always, I hope that all of you, as well as your loved ones, remain healthy and safe. Today, we will discuss commentary on 3 areas. First, the progress we have made on our great cruise come back. Second, our recent booking and demand trends, which have shown particular strength for sailings operating in second half of 2022 and for all of 2023, when our fleet is expected to be back in full operation in its normalized occupancy levels. And finally, on our exciting pipeline of new vessels, which we expect to contribute outsized EBITDA growth and other important financial metric improvements. Slide 4 outlines how far we have come on our return to service plan. When we last spoke in early August, we had just relaunched the first vessel in our fleet, Norwegian Jade in Greece, and we're on the verge of resuming cruising in the U.S., with Norwegian Encore making our West Coast debut, sailing to Alaska from Seattle. Since then, we have successfully relaunched 11 of our 28 vessels, with all 3 of our award winning brands resuming operations.  We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our re-launch ships. First, our crew has not missed a beat since returning. Seamlessly adapting to our new health and safety protocols and going above and beyond to deliver the exceptional vacation experiences our brands are known for. This commitment to service has resulted in record high guest satisfaction scores with each one sequentially better than the month before. And second, we are seeing the power of our industry-leading bundling strategy pay off and get our boarding our vessels with fresh wallet, which coupled with robust pent-up demand for all kinds of experiences, is translating to remarkably strong onboard revenue generation.  In fact, onboard revenue has exceeded our base on expectations by over 20% with broad-based strength across all shifts, regions, and revenue streams. While I would caution though, against extrapolating these figures as permanent or indicative of steady-state future performance just yet, as there are several transitory factors that may be contributing to the elevated current level including pent-up demand, cabin, and guests mix, it is nonetheless an encouraging and positive signal of the healthy consumer demand we are experiencing.  Lastly, and most importantly, these relaunched shifts have already contributed positive cash flow in the third quarter, even with our self-imposed occupancy level cap s. Despite a return to service going studying with the unfortunate summer stood as a Delta variant, I'm happy to say that our robust multilayered sales face health and safety protocols worked as designed to mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. The prevalence of cases we identified is pre -boarding testing, mid-Cruise and then at departation were in consequential and well below what we all saw in the general population during this time.  In short, we were able to fairly evaluate and fine tune our rigorous protocols during one of the highest heights of the pandemic, and the stellar results speak for themselves. Today, all ships in our fleet continue operating with a strict 100% vaccination requirement, coupled with universal pre -embarkation testing and multiple layers of additional protection once onboard, including upgraded air filtration systems and well-resourced medical centers. We will continue to follow science and evaluate and modify our protocols as needed, with guidance from our team of experts led by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and former applicable Public Health Authority.  As I have said, time and time again, our commitments at health and safety is far and away, the most important principle that our Company operates at all levels. And not just now, but pre and post pandemic as well. And we are willing to go to great lengths to protect our guests, crew and the communities we visit. Just last week, we were pleased to receive positive view from the CDC with a temporary extension of the framework for conditional sailing order through January 15th of 2022, at which point the order will revert to a voluntary program.  We view this as a positive step forward for our Company and the industry at large and we were encouraged to see positive recognition by the CDC of the successful resumption of cruising and the length we have all taken to enhance our already stringent health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19, which continue to be much more rigorous and much more comprehensive than those implemented by any other travel, leisure, or hospitality sector. With the progress of  is met with vaccinations, therapeutics, and adapting to living in the ongoing pandemic environment, the worst is seemingly behind us.  Each day we become increasingly confident in our ability to flawlessly execute on our Phase Voyager assumption, which is detailed by Brian and by  on Slide 5. We continue to expect our full fleet to be back in operation by April 1st of 2022, and with this steady and prudent trajectory, we are well-positioned for a projected return to pre -pandemic occupancy levels across our fleet no later than the beginning of the third quarter of 2022, and in time to capture peak summer season demand and pricing.  While we expect to continue seeing some fits and start as we ramp up our re-launch, we are keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions, and any other changes in global public health environment which could affect our return to service plans as we are ready to adapt accordingly. Turning to slide 6, we shift today's discussion to our booking and demand trends. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see robust future demand for cruising, particularly for sailings operating in the second half of 2022, and all of 2023 as evidenced by our record cumulative book position during these periods.  You'll recall at the beginning of our third quarter, our booked position for full-year 2022 was meaningfully and significantly ahead of 2019's record levels and at higher pricing. However, in consistent with the pullback seen by the broader economy and in particular the travel and leisure sector, that summer Delta variant surge resulted in a marked slowdown in our net booking volumes. The impact was heavily weighted to closer in-sailings, particularly for fourth quarter 2021 and first quarter 2022, with the impact lessening sequentially throughout 2022 and beyond.  Rather than chase scarce demand during the delta surge by dropping prices, and/or spending marketing funds in a less than optimal manner, we strategically chose to wait for consumer sentiment to rebound, as we have seen direct ebbs and flows in our booking patterns throughout the pandemic coinciding with changes in the public health environment. Throughout this difficult 10-week period, we remain disciplined and continue to hold or even raise pricing, and the outcome is that today, we see both record load and record pricing for the second half of 2022 and for all of 2023.  We are intently focused on the long-term brand positioning and profitability of the Company and are simply not willing to sacrifice pricing in order to increase load factors in the upcoming transitional quarters. As it happened in past surges and as the COVID-19 situation recently improved, we have experienced a rebound in bookings, with net booking volumes improving sequentially over the past 6 weeks. We believe this improvement will accelerate moving forward at first. Our brands begin to ramp up their demand-generating marketing investments in mid-November, coinciding with Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotion.  And second, the much anticipated and expected recovery in the travel agent channel space. And lastly, the approval of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, which came just last night and will allow for an expanded group of 100% vaccinated guests, especially families, to sail on our brand. Our go-to-market and full vaccination strategy has paid off and drove. And today, our full-year 2022 load factor remains in line with 2019 record levels and at higher pricing, even when including the diluted impact of future cruise credits.  In addition, we are meaningfully better booked for second half of 2022 and full-year 2023 sailings, and at better pricing that at any similar point in time in the past. Our primary focus continues to be on these periods when our fleet is expected to be in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. and as I mentioned before, just in time to capture the all-important third quarter peak summer season, which traditionally is the most profitable quarter for the industry. Now, breaking down our book position for full-year 2022 further, more than 55% of bookings are from loyal repeat cruises to our brand. In addition, approximately 75% is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainder comprised of future cruise credit. So far, approximately 60% of the total value of our outstanding SECs have been redeemed. As a reminder, the value added 125% future cruise credits will issue -- will issue -- that we issued at the beginning of the pandemic can only be applied to sailings through year-end 2022, resulting in 0 yield dilution when we look to 2023 and beyond.  And while still early, booking trends with 2023 as I've -- as I hinted thus far, are also off to an impressive start. Our booking windows continue to be elongated versus historical level, with guests booking further into the future, particularly for the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand. Case in point in August, Regent set a record for the largest booking day in its 29-year history with the launch of its 2023/2024 voyage collection. Reservations surpassed its previous record by approximately 15%. And while all itineraries were popular, notable destinations of interest were Africa, Asia, and the Baltics, demonstrating our guests continued appetite for long and exotic itineraries.  And in September, the sales launch of just a single ship, Oceania Cruise 's new 1200 passenger Vista, which doesn't debut until April of 2023, set an all-time single day booking record for that brand that surpassed the most recent record set in March of 2021 by nearly 60%. 1/2 of the available inventory for Vista's inaugural season, was sold in a single day, with 30% of bookings coming from new to brand guests. These incredible record-breaking milestones are further proof of the exceptional demand we continue to experience for our brand's unique product offerings from both new and loyal guests alike. Strong future demand in both load factor and pricing is also empirically evidenced in our advanced ticket sales bills.  Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $500 million on a gross basis in the quarter, equating to an approximately 65% increase versus the prior quarter's fill. In addition, and more importantly, our cash advanced ticket sales for sailings beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and beyond are approximately 45% higher than at the same time for record year 2019. As we move forward with phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this tremendous momentum to continue sequentially. Looking to the future of 2022 will also mark an exciting new chapter for our Company as we welcome the first shift in the next class of vessels for Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Prima, in summer of 2022.  I just returned from the shipyard in Italy a few weeks ago where I was able to witness firsthand what an evolution, Prima, is for them, the Regent brand, and for the industry at large, which you can see on slide 7. Everything about her was impressive and she has been meticulously designed to elevate the guest experience. Last month, we unveiled Prima 's entertainment lineup, including its interactive headline show, the Tony-award nominated musical Summer, the Donna Summer Musical. Norwegian Prima will also showcase numerous cruise industry first and new to brand experiences, including the world's first transforming venue that converts from a three-story theater into a Vegas style nightclub, exhilarating freefall drop dry slide, and a tri -level 1200 foot long race track, the largest at sea. The Prima Speedway will be the first ever 3 level race track and is over 20% larger than that on Norwegian Encore, featuring 14 turns, where drivers can reach speed of nearly 40 miles per hour.  Prima's advanced sales continue to impress, even after her record shattering sales debut in May, which set a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018. And despite the introduction being 6 weeks later than Norwegian Bliss. Our booking volumes are trending in line with data Bliss the previous fastest selling new builds for the line and a materially higher prices. As you can see on Slide 8, Norwegian Prima is just the first ship to look forward to in our industry-leading growth profile of 9 world-class ships coming online to 2027.  This new-build will grow our berth count by approximately 40%, adding 24,000 additional berth across our 3 brands. In 2023 when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our berth capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019's pre -pandemic levels. The addition of these new cutting-edge ships will also favorably change our cabin mix as illustrated on slide 9, with premium cabins increasing to approximately 65% of total berth versus approximately 60% today.  In addition to the premium mix of real estate onboard, our new ships have all the bells and whistles, additional streams for onboard revenue generation with new and innovative experiences, and the latest technology to improve efficiency versus our existing fleet. Excitement around new ships is also a significant demand driver and a powerful engine to fuel future yields, EBITDA, cash flow and ROIC growth. It brings new guests to our brand s, and it brings back repeat guests as well, helping us to appeal to every segment that we are targeting. And given our base of only 28 ships in our fleet, we are ready and eager to easily and profitably absorb this new capacity as it will allow us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate numerous attractive and high potential unserved and underserved markets globally.  The strategic addition of the Prima and Prima Plus Class, for example, which are smaller but more upscale than our previous Breakaway and Breakaway Plus Class at approximately 3,200 berth for the first two Prima Class Ships, and increasing to nearly 3,600 berths for the next four Prima's Plus Class Ships will give us additional bandwidth and flexibility to optimize the deployments that are most profitable and allow the line to continue to manning premium pricing with the right size ship in the right place and at the right time.  And as slide 10 shows, we have historically demonstrated our success and not only absorbing capacity, but translating this capacity growth into outsized revenue, outsized adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow growth that significantly outpaces the growth in absolute capacity. We fully expect to continue this trend and drive meaningful growth to the top and bottom line with the addition of these exciting new ships. I'll be back later to provide an update on our ESG efforts, as well as provide the closing remarks but for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. We reached a significant financial milestone in the third quarter with our first voyages resuming sailing after a previously unimaginable, 500 plus days with 0 revenue-generating operations. Our return to service has been very successful and we remain on track to execute on our Phase Voyager resumption plan. By the end of the third quarter, we had started 37 voyages, completed 29, and had 8 ships in service, representing approximately 40% of our berth capacity. Occupancy in the third quarter was approximately 57%, in line with our expectations and reflecting our self-imposed occupancy limits.  As we have outlined previously, we have taken a conservative approach to occupancy with our voyage resumption, which proved to be prudent with the rise of the Delta variant, to ensure that health and safety remains our number 1 priority. Increasing our occupancy is not a race, and we are focused on being diligent and thoughtful in ramping up of occupancy levels to protect not just our guests and crew, but also our long-term brand equity. Despite the reduced occupancy levels in the quarter, I am extremely happy to report that the fleet that operated in the period was cash flow positive.  Looking ahead, by year-end, we expect to have 17 ships representing approximately 75% of capacity back in service with the full fleet operating as we enter the second quarter 2022. Turning to liquidity and cash burn on Slide 11, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, earlier this week, we further enhanced our liquidity profile by entering into a 1 billion commitment, through mid-August 2022. This liquidity backstop enhances our financial flexibility and provides immediate and additional liquidity should the need arise. If drawn, the commitment would convert into an unsecured note maturing in April 2024. For sake of clarity, we have not drawn on this facility and do not intend to do so given our current projected recovery at this time. As for cash  for the third quarter, Our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately 275 million lower than prior guidance of 285 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn to increase to approximately 350 million as we continue to ramp up restart expenses and additional vessels reenter service.  During the quarter, we are expecting a ramp up of demand-generating marketing investments as we head into the holidays with Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Wave Season. It is important to note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings, or the contribution from shifts that have re-entered service, both of which we expect to accelerate as we move forward.  On a net basis, based on our current resumption plan, we continue to expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive towards the tail under the first quarter of 2022. In addition, based on our current trajectory and market conditions, we are on a solid path to return to profitability for the second half of 2022. Turning to slide 12, our cash balance in the third quarter decreased to $1.9 billion of cash and equivalents, driven by approximately $825 million of operating cash burn, including OpEx expenses, SG&A interest and CapEx, customer cash refunds of approximately $115 million, and net working capital and other inflows of approximately $125 million, which is net of health and safety investments and cash collections from current and future voyages.  With 2022 now just around the corner, we have provided some additional guidance to assist with modeling for certain metrics on slide 17, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption, and capital expenditures. In addition, we have provided detail on our annual capacity growth expectations on Slide 18. As we gear up to deliver on our impressive growth profile through 2027, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to both earnings and cash flow generation. Lastly, with much of the focus in the market on inflationary pressure, I wanted to touch quickly on what we're experiencing.  We're still fine-tuning our 2022 plans and related projections, and we'll provide more color on our cost outlook on our next earnings call. However, similar to almost all other industries, we are seeing pockets of pressures in areas such as fuel, food, and other commodities. Our supply chain group continues to work diligently to mitigate these costs. And we are fortunate that the timing of our ramp-up in operations is relieving some of the transitory cost pressures. The good news is that we are a primarily fixed cost business, which is beneficial in an inflationary environment.  On the labor front, we have a high degree of visibility on our costs as the vast majority of our crew, which comprises the bulk of our employee base, are covered under multi-year agreements. On the flip side, we're also seeing very strong pricing power, which is helping to offset inflationary crusher. Even with the pricing power we are seeing, cruise vacations continue to operate incredibly compelling value proposition versus a land-based vacation alternative. We have said in the past, that a cruise vacation typically offers at least 20% to 30% better value, than a similar land-based alternative.  With the current inflationary backdrop and on a relative scale, we believe our offering and value proposition is even more compelling now than ever before. Without the same labor market pressures that many of our land-based peers are experiencing, we can provide a consistent and exceptional level of service for our guests, which is evidenced by our record, high guest satisfaction scores since resuming sailing. These factors combined will continue to allow us to further increase our prices on our multi-year strategy to achieving pricing parity to that of land-based vacation offerings. Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while the global public health environment remains fluid, and we are not yet completely out of the woods, we are increasingly optimistic as we continue on our road to recovery. We are now in a position to pivot to a more offensive approach and shift our attention to executing on our medium and long-term financial recovery plan, which is outlined on slide 13. As part of this plan, we will remain focused on rebuilding our strong track record of financial performance, optimizing our Balance Sheet, and delivering on our attractive and disciplined growth profile. I look forward to updating you on our progress in our next call, but for now, I will hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, sales and sustained on slide 14. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of this program. On the environmental front in addition to ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions rate, during the quarter, we made the first purchase under our new carbon offset program. As a reminder, over the summer, we announced that we have committed to purchasing high-quality, verified harboring credit to offset the equivalent of 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over a 3-year period. This is a measurable step in near-term emissions reductions, which will help bridge the gap in our decarbonization effort until new technologies become feasible. Our 3 million ton commitment is sizable, and we plan to increase offset purchases in future years that help us reach our goal of carbon neutrality. We also strive to maintain a supportive and empowering workplace for our team members across the globe, who are without doubt our most valuable asset.  As such, we recently announced that we have indefinitely moved to a 4-1 flexible work model for our shoreside team members globally, which requires employees to work in office Monday through Thursday and remotely on Friday. This new work model allows us to provide additional flexibility for our team members while also supporting our business goals, maintaining productivity and fostering the in-person collaboration and workplace culture that we are so proud of. We are honored that this commitment to our team was recognized with our naming to the Forbes World's Best Employers list.  This recognition came after also being named to the Forbes America's Best Employers list earlier this year in which we ranked among the top 75 companies in the overall large employer category and among the top ten companies in the travel and leisure sector. And while we are pleased with the progress we have made to date on our ESG efforts, we have no plans to stop here. We are committed to continuing to drive positive change and make a lasting impact on the world as responsible corporate citizens.  In addition, we remain focused on enhancing disclosures around our ESG efforts to ensure transparency and accountability around this critical topic for our key stakeholders, and I look forward to sharing additional details with you as we continue on our ESG journey. Turning to slide 15, I'd like to leave you with a few final key takeaways. First, our return to service is on track and initial voyages have been successful on all fronts. Our health and safety protocols are working as intended, and we are seeing strong onboard revenue and high guest satisfaction scores. And we are increasingly confident in our ability to execute on our phase voyage resumption plan with a target to have our full fleet in operation by April 1st of next year. Despite headwinds in the third quarter related to the Delta variant, we continue to experience strong future demand for cruising, with positive booking and pricing trends, particularly for the back half of 2022, and throughout 2023. And lastly, we believe we are nearing an inflection point with the worst of the pandemic now appearing to be behind us. Our future is bright and we look forward to the next chapter in our Company's storied history as we deliver in our industry-leading growth profile, which we expect while providing meaningful boost to financial results and shareholder value in the coming years. And with that Laurie, let's open up for questions. Operator : Thank you, Frank. . In order to get as many people through the queue, please limit your time to 1 question. . Our first question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thank you for taking the questions. I know you don't want to give too much color on 2022 yet, but I would love to just hear any guard rails to think about for load factor over the course of the year. And then maybe looking longer term. If you compare and contrast the Company versus 2019, what's structural changes are you contemplating as it relates to their itineraries, marketing approaches, or otherwise as you assess consumer behavior and changes to your own operations? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : That's a mouthful, Steve. But I'll try to get through it. We thought we have perfected our itineraries, our deployment. And so I don't see major changes in how we deploy our vessels in 2022 and beyond, assuming that the world re-opens. Today as the world is in the process of reopening. As you know, Asia is still primarily closed, but we believe that by the time our next Asia season begins, which would be about this timing '22, that it will be open. We do have new vessels coming online. Like I said, four over the next 2 years and we're eager to take possession of those vessels. We said time and time again, we have many unserved and underserved market because we only have a fleet of 28 vessels. So we're anxiously awaiting the receipt of those vessels, which we believe will be accretive to the yields and certainly EBITDA and ROIC and all the financial metrics. Turning to 2022, we have to start looking at '22 not as a year, not as a block, but sequentially.  Certainly, a back half of '22 today is looking much better than the first half, partly because of the effects of the Delta variant on booking trends. And consumer behavior will affect Q1 more than Q2 and Q2 more than Q3. But sequentially, 2022 is ramping up very, very nicely. We said in our prepared remarks, the back half of '22 today is meaningfully, and significantly better booked than we were at this time for 2019 or any year. So, we're way ahead in load. And that gives us confidence to continue with the price discipline because today, not only do we have that meaningful load, but we're ahead in pricing. I feel very, very good about 2022, and I can make the same identical remarks about '23, ahead in load, meaningfully, and ahead in pricing. Q2 is a what I would really call the pivot quarter. We see demand coming back strongly for '22. But as you know, where we still have -- by the end of the year, we'll have 17 ships in the water, that means that we're going to introduce 11 vessels between January 1 and April 1, and those will be ramping up until second quarter will be a transition year -- a transition quarter where all the vessels will be an operation.  But we look -- we feel very good about Q2 as well. So, look, I'm feeling better than I have nearly 2 years. Advanced bookings are strong. One of the wonderful things about this industry is that we have incredible visibility into the future. And because consumers are booking earlier than ever, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have visibility into the -- and further into the future than we ever have. And that visibility is a very positive one. Stephen Grambling : Perhaps as a quick follow-up. When you look at the strong booking trends in the back half of the year, can you provide any color on the composition between new to brand or new to cruise versus the existing custom base, and what's driving that? Frank Del Rio : Look, I think it's not much different than what we said earlier. About 55% are repeat are slightly higher than normal. We've moderated our marketing spend. And so, when you moderate, you're marketing spend, you tend to go to that segment of the market that you know best that's the easiest and least expensive to go after, and that's our past guests. So, we have a little bit of an elevated past guests, which is good. They know the brand, that's what you want. We're not getting ready to roll out our big marketing push in anticipation of ways to promote Black Friday, to promote Cyber Monday. And we have high hopes for a very, very good voyage season. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator : And our next question is from Brandt Montour of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Brandt Montour : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Frank or Mark, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on occupancy nearer term, perhaps maybe exit rate coming out of the third quarter, or maybe even better, just talk a little bit about the self-imposed caps and how you foresee your ability to raise those in the next, call it 2 to 5 months? Mark Kempa : Good morning, Brandt. Look, so third quarter was in line with our expectations. I think we had roughly 57% occupancy. As we said time and time and again, we're not in a race to just fill volume. We want to maintain price discipline and we're going to do that. When we look ahead at the fourth quarter, we're going to have, I believe, 17 ships in operation, approximately 75% of our capacity. And as we continue in the first quarter, we'll have almost our entire fleet operational effectively by the end of the first quarter. Rather than look at occupancy, I think a better metric is looking at the number of passengers that we're carrying. I think in the third quarter, we had about 60,000 of roughly passengers carried.  That's going to increase to roughly 150,000, 175,000 in Q4, 250,000 to 300,000 in Q1, and then you're up back into the 0.5 million. So, our occupancy is ramping up in line with our fleet roll out. Pricing discipline is important to us. We've said time and time and again, we want to protect that. We want to protect the long-term brand equity. So, we're going to do it in a thoughtful and rational manner rather than chasing that cheap customer just to gain that point of occupancy. Brandt Montour : Thanks for that, Mark. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think one of the themes of travel and leisure this quarter is just trying to figure out how long the pent-up demand can last and positively impact consumer spend. Frank, I was wondering if you wanted to just give some thoughts on the onboard spend picture, and is there any reason why it doesn't eventually revert to 2019 levels? Anything structural you would call out as why it might settle above those levels going forward? Frank Del Rio : In terms of your pent-up demand question, no one has a crystal ball. All I can tell you is the empirical evidence that we have based on bookings. People are booking out -- booking further out than ever before. That's the combination of the fact that we have introduced itineraries earlier than ever, though there were available for sale. But also, people's -- the psyche of the consumer, they want to cruise, they want to travel. Maybe they don't want to travel this quarter or maybe even next quarter, and they're pushing it out further and further, hoping that the COVID situation improves drastically.  So, I do believe that we're going to continue having greater visibility than we had in the past. Then that will continue for some time. In terms of onboard revenue. Look, we\u2019ve seen the consumer spending across -- lots of different sectors are up and it's no different onboard our vessels. As you know, we lead the industry by a very wide margin in onboard yield -- onboard revenue yield, and that continues. I cautioned in my prepared remarks that I'm not ready to declare victory in the sense that the very positive trends in onboard revenue higher than they've ever been before will continue and definitely and then you can put it in the permanent column because it's just too early, is the reason why people are spending so much because of the pent-up demand.  Is it because of cabin mix where at least in the third quarter and you'll see it in the fourth quarter as well, slightly elevated percentage of our cabins that have sold are in the upper categories, the suites, the balcony cabins? And one of the truisms of this business is those who pay more to get onboard pay or spend more once onboard. But it also goes to the fundamental strength of our industry-leading bundling strategy.  We believe in the bundling strategy. We're doing more and more bundling across the three brands, and that gives people a very fresh wallet because the combination of them booking further out means they have even more time to refill that wallet and make it even fresher, if you will. And so, all these factors are contributing to the higher onboard spend. I hope it continues. We'll do everything possible to fuel that continuation. But I just wanted to fill a little bit of caution to the wind that I'm not ready to the chalk it up as a permanent shift, if you will, or a permanent source of revenue above and beyond what we've always led the industry on. Mark Kempa : And Brandt one just -- one piece of additional color there is we are getting smarter not only what the bundling. But our marketing systems around the pre onboard sell. We're getting smarter throughout the booking cycle. We started really working on that heavily a couple of years ago and we started to see some fruit bearing on that in 2019. Again, that's just going to be another propellant to help us. But I think as Frank has said, we'd be naive to think that there's not going to be some settling. Brandt Montour : Excellent. Thanks for the thoughts, guys. Operator : And our next question is from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious. You are the moving pieces as it relates to occupancy ramps and sounds like pricings quite strong, you alluded to some cost pressures in the business, fuel prices are up. Curious on the other side of this exiting in the next year, but hopefully things are more back to normal. What do you think the margin opportunity is within the business going into even '23, and if you think efficiencies gained can put your margins higher than they were pre -COVID? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Hey. Hi, Vince. Look, I think we're setting ourselves up nicely for margin expansion and ROIC improvement. It's quite still important to keep that pricing discipline. We've seen time and time again that companies have dropped prices as we saw back in 2008 and 2009 during the great recession, it takes years. There are some who have not yet recovered to their pre -great recession yields, a decade later or more than a decade later. So we're fixated on maintaining pricing.  We'll sacrifice short-term load factors in order to preserve long-term pricing. And long-term pricing at the end of the day is what's going to drive margins along with the fact that we are going to be introducing 4 vessels that are premium, including the Norwegian New Prima Vessel, more balcony cabins, we're increasing our percentage of the -- of our premium accommodations to 65%. And so all those factors, including the fact that we were getting -- we have gotten a lot smarter during the pandemic about how we market to our customers using technologies : the so-called Zoom world. Marketing is becoming more efficient. And we'll see whether the general inflation pressures that are being called transitory are transitory or not. But as Mark mentioned, we are primarily a fixed cost business, and during inflationary times, we come out ahead. And we're seeing it that we have pricing power. Pricing power is the pretty word of inflation. Yes, we have inflation pressures on some line items as Mark mentioned : fuel, commodities, food. But we've got that pricing power that is translating into high yields.  So we believe that in late '22, '23 forward, our margins should improve. And events on those on the new capacity that comes online. Generally speaking, is we're bringing new capacity. It tends to be anywhere from 10% to 15% more efficient on a unit basis. So that inherently provides some tailwind for us as we move forward and with our growth profile, I think we can -- there's some tremendous opportunity there. Vince Ciepiel : Great, thanks. And as follow-up to that, I thought , were interested losing relative to the land-based alternatives. If you look at hotel leisure prices were a good amount ahead of 2019 levels, curious if there's any way to quantify that gap. Do you see it being a significant opportunity, 10%, 20% of value relative to land-based or any way to qualify moving towards parity of land-based and what they can mean for yield? Frank Del Rio : Look, I think there's a great opportunity and you have to do it almost brand by brand. You want to compare a region to the cruise to stay at a Four Seasons Hotel, you want to compare a Norwegian Cruise to perhaps a share into it. But I can tell you that all the internal analysis that we do when you combine the total cost of a vacation, transportation, accommodations, your meals, your drinks, entertainment, in any location a cruise vacations value is just off the charts.  And while we want to continue offering consumers that great value, which is why our ships are always full -- the industry ships are always full. Hotel chains, can't say that their hotel rooms are always full, but we can't because of the value proposition, the way we market. And therefore that's where the opportunity is. The opportunity is to claw back some of that value that we're giving away and still provide consumers with a very attractive vacation experience. Mark Kempa : And every dollar we compare we can claw back in that gap. The vast majority that drops directly to the bottom line. So it really becomes this really bottom-line economic driver pretty quickly. So we're very So, focused on that. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks for all the color. Operator : And our next question is from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Your line is open. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, guys. Good morning. So Frank I'm going to ask you another question about load factors and kind of getting the path back to normalized load factors that you talked about the third quarter of next year. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more. It seems like the most debatable vaccine demographic, so to speak, is obviously around kids. Meaning that it seems a lot of parents are not going to get their kids vaccinated. So I guess the actual questions here is, once this CSO is eventually relaxed in January, do you see yourself starting to potentially relax that vaccine mandate for kids in order to get your load factors back to normal, or that just won't be the case? And if that's not the case, maybe help us bridge that gap. Frank Del Rio : Yeah. This -- I don't -- we're going to announce very, very soon that we have indefinitely extended our 100% vaccination requirement. I think that today that continues to be a competitive advantage to our 3 brands. I think that our 3 brands emerge from this COVID crisis in a much better standing in the consumer's eye because of our strong early stands on health and safety, vaccinations, etc., and it's something we want to build on. The children's vaccination for 5 to 11 year old were just announced yesterday.  My understanding is that likely sometime in Q1, the same vaccination approval will be given for up to four-year-old. So I do believe that the target market that cruises is more likely than general population to number one be vaccinated and then we will see. Time and time again where a past cruiser or a one who intends to cruise is significantly more vaccinated than those who don't intend to cruise. So it's a bit of a self-selection situation. I believe that will translate also into children. But we're not going to sacrifice the health and safety of anyone for the sake of adding a point or 2 or 3 or whatever the number is to load. So we will continue mandating a 100% vaccination as long as the science dictate that that's what we ought to do. Steve Wieczynski : Understood. Thanks for that. Second question would be around direct bookings. And it seems to us from the outside that the direct bookings are -- have moved a good bit higher relative to pre -pandemic levels. And I'm wondering if that's kind of what you guys are seeing as well and maybe what you think is potentially driving that? And is this something that could change long-term booking patterns or is it just something else that's causing uplift right now in direct? Frank Del Rio : we're -- we've seen it as well. We're hoping that the travel agent community comes back in full force. They've also been out of work, and unlike the big public cruise companies that can go to Wall Street and raise billions of dollars, these are mostly smaller businesses and can't. And so I'm praying and hoping that they do come back in full force.  But at the end of the day, we have to fill our vessels in any way we can, and we do offer consumers multiple choices of how to engage with us. We prefer the travel agency channel. It is our biggest channel. It is coming back. We've seen improvements sequentially quarter-by-quarter in terms of the percentage of our business that is being booked by travel agents. And I do believe that once our fleet is back in operation, along with that of our peers, that they will come back. But if not, we have adapted, we are prepared, we have the technology, we have the wherewithal to take the bookings. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color. Operator : And our next question is from James Ainley of Citi. Your line is open. James Ainley : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could I ask you maybe for some color on the brand performances? I guess  should be attracting to suggest that the higher-end brands have been garnering much stronger interest. Is that something you're seeing or are you seeing that demand spreading out the stack down the brand scales, please? Frank Del Rio : Well look, the upscale brands, the luxury brands, typically booked further out than the contemporary brands because their itineraries are longer, more exotic in there for the planning process. And so, we do have more visibility into -- especially into 2023 on the Ocean and the Regent brands than we do in Norwegian, but we're seeing steady progress throughout the ecosystem. The Norwegian brand customer coming back and booking as they normally would book, except that for second half of '22 and in all '23, that booking volume is better than ever. And so we're very pleased with that, that the demand is such that consumers want to cruise, and as I said earlier, everything else being equal, they feel more confident being able to cruise in Q3 next year, than in Q1 for example. Because of the ever-present threat of the COVID and if COVID starts to fade into the background, all the experts have said COVID is not going to go away one day. It will pan out from being a pandemic to an epidemic, and we'll all have to learn to live with it. We may have to take COVID booster shots every year like the flu.  But I do -- I am encouraged to see how, in different parts of the world and I traveled internationally for the first time in the last few weeks. I went to Italy, I went to the UK, went to New York for the first time in almost 2 years, how people have adapted. And like I said earlier the cruising population, the target cruiser is a better versed individual than the average population. They can afford to cruise, they're better vaccinated. And so all those points, I'm encouraged that again, the pandemic is not going to go away or the COVID is never going to disappear. But we will learn to live with it. James Ainley : Thank you. And as a follow-up, can I ask about how you're handling the sort of operating restrictions. Are you able to sail your ships to the majority of places you want to go to? And there's the reason I'm asking is a loyal Regent Seven Seas customer might come back for one cruise, but then it's looking for something new and something different and but do you feel that you can offer enough variety given the kind of state of focal restrictions as you see them today? Frank Del Rio : We are -- the answer -- the short answer is yes. The longer answer is we're staging the return of our vessels not haphazardly but in a very measured way based on the availability of ports. And so, by the time that our entire fleet is operating, which will be very early in Q2 on April 1st, we believe that the seasonal nature of the cruise industry being heavily in Alaska and Europe beginning in Q2 throughout Q3, that the world will be open. By the time we get to Q4 of '22 and you start sailing to exotic places throughout Asia, South America.  We believe that by then the closure that we are seeing today will abate. And so yes, itineraries are a big deal. It's one of the secret sauce ingredients that make our Company the highest yielding Company, because we go to high yielding itineraries with wonderful vessels that have a lot of cabins that are with balconies and suites, which as I said, many times is the second driver of yields after itinerary. We believe all those pressures that we're seeing today will subside by the time that our operations are back in full. James Ainley : Great. Thank you very much. Frank Del Rio : You're welcome. Operator, I think we have time for 1 more question. Operator : Yes. Our last question is from Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask a balance sheet question. You mentioned in the slides before return to paying dividends that you want to focus on the balance sheet. I'm just wondering if there's a targeted leverage range you're thinking. And then related on the balance sheet is, I'm curious why the billion-dollar facility undrawn. You're so close to positive cash flow and you have no big maturities in the next 2 years. I'm just curious behind setting that up. Thanks. Mark Kempa : Good morning, Robin. Yeah, first on covering the targeted leverage. Pre -pandemic we had said our goal was to get to that 2 1/2, 2 3/4 range. And we haven't lost sight of that. But I think when we look at the near and mid-term, our first goal is going to be to get, \"let's get below 5, \" and then we're going to target to get below 4. So we're going to continue to chop it down year-after-year with accelerating cash flows and get that back down into that 3, 4 times. It's going to take some time to do that, but we're focused on it. We've done it before. We know how to do it, there is management team. So we're confident we can get there. We have the ability in the business. In terms of the billion-dollar commitment look, I think as we look forward, I stated in my remarks that we're now going into a more offensive approach around our balance sheet management. What this does is really is we look at it as a very low cost but yet effective backstop rather than us having to necessarily go out and commit to permanent debt and/or permanent further dilution. I -- it's an extremely low-cost measure to have on the books which will allow us independently of that, to start taking some balance sheet action and not have to worry about the broader picture. Again, we do not intend to draw on it. Our intention is not to draw on it. We have the facility there as part of our larger game plan. But in the event we need to draw on it or something in that nature. Most likely, or more than likely, we would go out to the public markets and go after some papers that is much more cost-effective. So, again, in balancing all of our needs, we think this provides a backstop without committing us for any long-term additional debt  dilution. And look one additional thought is that we've seen what Delta does and we want to make sure we're always been in a position to be ahead of some of the unknown. So again, this is more of us going to an offensive approach in terms of our balance sheet on a go-forward basis. Robin Farley : Okay, now great. That makes sense. Thanks. Can we just -- one final thing. Are you back to issuing future cruise credits again, when you have to cancel the cruise, which I realize there's not probably not -- Frank Del Rio : No. We stopped that, I believe in the -- either at the end of 2020 or the first quarter -- in the first quarter of 2021. Actually, much earlier than that. I'm sorry, mid-2020, I think it was. So we have not issued future cruise credits. I want to say probably second quarter - ish of 20. Robin Farley : Okay. Mark Kempa : I might be off their slightly, but generally speaking, that was the timeframe. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Robin. And thank you, everyone for your time and support today. We will be available to answer any of your questions a little later on. Have a great day and stay safe. Mark Kempa : Thank you, everyone. Bye bye. Operator : And this concludes today's Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Business Update and Fourth Quarter Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maria, and I'll be the operator today. . I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Kempa. Mr. Kempa, please proceed. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Frank and I for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings and business update call. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which I will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.  Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with the fourth quarter and full year 2021 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.  Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. And as always, I hope that all of you as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe.  Before going into my main commentary, I'd like to address the recent geopolitical issue, which escalated last night. The tense situation in Ukraine is regrettable. And our hopes are that the conflict ends quickly with minimal impact to the safety and welfare of those in the region. We are following the situation carefully as it impacts our voyages in the area. We have no vessels in the region until late May. And we will be updating guests on our plans and about affected itineraries as needed.  We have quite a bit to share with you today, ranging from our resumption of operations to the impacts of the Omicron surge to recent developments with the CDC. We'll also cover the booking and pricing landscape in our plans for the return to service of the balance of our fleet. So let's get started.  It seems like just yesterday that we launched our Great Cruise Comeback in late July of '21 after 500 days of no cruise operations. In the 5 months that followed through the end of 2021, we safely carried over 230,000 happy guests around the globe, everywhere from Europe to Alaska and points in between, delivering the unique and upscale vacation experiences that only our three award-winning brands can provide. This is evidenced by our brands having achieved the highest customer satisfaction scores in our history and a reflection of the deep commitment from our crew members, who are as energized as ever to be back in the high seas serving our guests.  In addition, onboard spend by guests during the quarter continued to exceed all expectations and reached all-time highs. And we delivered these unparalleled vacation experiences in the safest manner possible with protocols that are unmatched by any other area of the hospitality sector. I'll repeat once again that our #1 priority is and always will be the health and safety of our guests, crew and the communities we serve. And that commitment has never been more evident than in a month since our return to service.  With over 230,000 guests sailing on our vessels in 2021, our COVID positivity rate was miniscule and certainly a fraction of what has been the case in the population at large. Our science-backed protocols, centered on vaccination and preboarding testing, provide a safe vacation experience that is not duplicated anywhere in the world. Today, and because of the rapid decrease in prevalence and in severity, the prospective view of the pandemic is rapidly changing across the globe. Municipalities, cities, states, countries, schools, institutions of all kinds and private businesses alike are all moderating protocols as the public health environment improves.  In the past, protocols were usually pared back slowly and only when cases had receded. But we have seen many instances, Denmark and Iceland being one of the best and most recent examples, where protocols and restrictions have been moderated despite high or even increasing caseloads. This latest normal now takes into account the diminished severity of the virus and balances the extent of necessary protocols with the need to resume daily life. The confidence for society to take these actions is mainly due to the availability and widespread uptake of vaccines, new therapeutics and broad immunity. And an NCL cruise ship is one of the few places in the world where you can be assured that at least 95% of the people around you are fully vaccinated. And we're pleased to report that the rapidly improving public health environment has allowed us also to follow the easing of COVID-related protocols occurring in broader society.  You can see on the return-to-service plan on Slide 4, a new phase, returning to normal, that reflects those changes and advances. Our brands recently announced that effective March 1, masking for guests across our fleet will be optional while taking into account local guidelines, if any. Also, beginning March 1 and in conjunction with the new CDC guidelines, which I'll discuss in a moment, the Norwegian brand will begin allowing all guests under the age of 12 to sail on an ship fleet-wide.  These two steps greatly expand the addressable market for our largest and most family-oriented brand by allowing families to travel together regardless of age and without the mandate of wearing a mask. This announcement was scheduled to provide plenty of time and opportunity for families to plan their summer vacations with us. And all this comes at a time when last week, we had the lowest number of positive pre-embarkation cases per 1,000 guests by far since launching service last July during the Delta surge.  Recently, we were happy to see significant regulatory progress being made as we received clarification from the CDC on updated protocols for sailing originating from the U.S. ports. Back in January, our three brands were the first in the industry to opt into the CDC's voluntary COVID-19 program for cruise ships operating in U.S. waters. When our brands first opted in, the program had not yet been finalized. However, last week, as protocols to the program were confirmed, our brands reaffirmed their commitment made in March and mid-January of opting into the program, demonstrating once again our industry-leading and unwavering dedication to health and safety with protocols that appropriately reflects the public health environment. The program our brands have opted into calls for at least 95% of vaccine-eligible guests and crew be vaccinated. Given the differences in demographics of our brands, a vaccination requirement will differ somewhat with Norwegian requiring guests aged 12 and over to be fully vaccinated while Oceania and Regent will continue to require all passengers to be fully vaccinated. Regardless, we will continue to require that 100% of crew across our fleet be fully vaccinated and are working towards having all crew members boosted by April 1.  The new updated protocols also allow for mask wearing to be optional as is the case with more and more societal activities. All the industry has ever asked is to be treated the same as other areas of society. The CDC's new voluntary program is a positive step in that direction, which we expect will lead to further easing of protocols as the pandemic continues its retreat. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain best-in-class protocols centered on vaccinations and testing for the health and safety of all onboard and to offer guests the safest vacation experience possible.  The resumption of service across our fleet was not without its challenges. As difficult an endeavor as it was to pause and find safe haven for our entire fleet back in the spring of 2020, it is even a greater feat to smoothly bring back the fleet into operation and to deliver the world-class level of hospitality and service our brands are known for. I want to thank team members across our organization, from shipboard to shoreside, for the hard work, dedication and passion they displayed in returning our fleet to service. I also want to thank our loyal past and new-to-brand guests for entrusting us with what, for many, has been their first taste of travel since the pandemic began 2 years ago. And a special and heartfelt thanks to the travel agency community, who have weathered the pandemic like no other. We stuck together through the industry's toughest times and are now reengaged to bring us all back stronger than ever. And finally, a thanks to our shareholders, lenders, shipyard partners and the broader financial community for your support and confidence in our company, supporting our growth story and the opportunities that lie ahead.  The story of the past quarter was obviously all about the Omicron wave. Unfortunately, Omicron did not pick the best of times to make its appearance. Just as we were experiencing a solid rebound in bookings during October and November after the Delta wave began to wane and buoyed by a very successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions, the impact of Omicron began to appear in early December.  First, a Norwegian vessel, whose itinerary featured multiple calls to South African port, had its operations paused as Omicron quickly spread there and additional travel restrictions were imposed. Canceling targeted sailings on certain vessels operating in the Caribbean and South America during the quarter also became necessary as an addition to travel restrictions, ports began implementing difficult, sometimes onerous requirements for docking. Concurrently, booking volumes slowed and cancellation of existing bookings increased. While Omicron did impact our business in the near term, primarily for close-in sailings in the first and second quarters, it did provide the opportunity to once again demonstrate our resilience as a company and as an industry. Our ethos throughout the pandemic has emphasized being nimble and ready to adapt. Our management team has maneuvered to what no other industry has ever had to do and has done a remarkable job doing so. The silver lining to this pandemic is that it has brought our team even closer together and fortified the strong collaborative culture we already enjoyed and that we truly believe is one of our competitive advantages. As we return to normalcy, that positive culture will only grow stronger. Now for some good news. The impact of Omicron are waning week-by-week. While the short term has been impacted, the following points illustrate the strong underlying consumer demand that gives us confidence about the trajectory of our business in the future. First, of the guest cancellations that occurred during December and the January period, the majority were for sailings in the first and second quarters of 2022, demonstrating sustained consumer confidence in sailings further out.  Second, beginning in mid-January, net booking volumes began improving and continue to do so and accelerate sequentially week-over-week. Third, booked position for each quarter in 2022 when compared to 2019 sequentially improved over the prior quarter. Fourth, despite the erosion in booked position due to the Delta and Omicron surges, as of today, second half 2022 booked position is in line with what was an extraordinarily strong 2019, while 2023, compared to pre-pandemic 2020, is in an even better position, in fact, a record booked position.  Fifth, again, as of today, pricing for 2022 and 2023 sailings remained higher for the full year versus 2019 and pre-pandemic 2020, respectively, even when including the diluted effect of future cruise credits. Our core go-to-market principle of marketing to fill versus discount to fill is performing like a champ as we have not and will not chase short-term occupancy by sacrificing price, which only results in long-term and perhaps even permanent damage to brand equity as we have seen over the years in other situations.  Sixth, despite sailing cancellations and slight changes in our return-to-service plans due to Omicron, all of our vessels are expected to sail by early May and in time for the peak summer season. And lastly, we are seeing our largest and most important distribution channels coming back to full strength. Every day, we are seeing more and more business being booked by our travel partners in a shift which bodes well for the industry as the vibrant travel agent community is vital and amplifies the reach of our message to consumers, which translates into more and better bookings.  I want everyone to recall that in the past, our industry was accustomed to successfully managing through bumps in the road. Whenever there was a natural or geopolitical or some other black swan-type event that impacted bookings, you could almost count like clockwork that after 8 to 10 weeks of quiet, booking patterns would rebound. We've seen this pattern occur twice already during the pandemic, once last spring after the initial variant ceded and vaccinations became prevalent and most recently, last fall, right after the Delta surge began to wane. With the public still a bit shellshocked by the sudden emergency -- emergence and equally dramatic decline of Omicron, what our business needs now is a few weeks of quiet with no new variants or surges for confidence to return and momentum to take hold. Our experts in the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, headed by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, believe we're at that point right now. So while Omicron did indeed have an immediate but short-term impact on our business, it was an impact that simply shifted expectations and the timing of our recovery by about 3 months.  That shift in timing is coinciding with the shift in societal attitudes that I mentioned earlier from avoiding the virus at all cost to living with it. It's something we really didn't see after the Delta wave but is gaining more and more momentum post Omicron. We are seeing more and more living of life. And we once again began hearing the term revenge travel being batted about. These shifts bode well for our company as vacationers look to once again explore the world but to do so in a safe manner.  I'll be back shortly with closing comments. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary and the progress of our financial action plan. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank. As mentioned earlier, going from a complete standstill to having over 70% of our capacity sailing by year-end, through not one but two COVID variants, has been an impressive effort in coordination and logistics. I give my thanks and kudos to our operations and hotels teams, both shipside and shoreside, for executing on this truly herculean endeavor. We have been deliberate and disciplined in bringing our fleet back gradually and have kept self-imposed load factor limitations in place to ensure the safety of our guests and crew members. I am pleased to report that strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue spend drove positive contribution from the fleet that operated in the quarter, despite the headwinds we faced from the remnants of Delta as well as the onset of the Omicron variant. This result reinforces our belief in the fundamental strength of the business as we reach 85% of our capacity back in operation during the first quarter and the entirety of our fleet back in service in the second quarter to capture demand for the peak summer travel season.  Based on our current trajectory, we expect to reach a key milestone in our recovery as the net cash provided by operating activities is expected to turn positive in the second quarter. In addition, we expect the second half of 2022 to be profitable for the company on an adjusted net income basis, marking an important transition for managing the daily business primarily around liquidity needs to shifting our focus back to maximizing profitability as we exit these unprecedented times. That said, we remain keenly focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position through this transition period. Moving to Slide 8. Our cash and short-term investments for the quarter decreased by approximately $200 million on a net basis to $1.75 billion. This includes $1 billion of cash burn associated with operations, including interest and capital expenditures, partially offset by nearly $600 million of advanced ticket sale collections and other working capital changes. Our quarter-ending cash and short-term investment balances were also boosted by an incremental $260 million associated with a series of balance sheet optimization transactions we executed in November.  More importantly, our liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.7 billion, including a $1 billion commitment through August 2022, which remains undrawn. In addition, our latest transaction earlier this month puts us in a strong position to manage the resumption of principal payments that had been deferred during the pandemic. Furthermore, as the environment improves, our own cash generation engine will be fully up and running, which will further strengthen our balance sheet.  A key part of that cash generation engine is our advanced ticket sales build. In the fourth quarter, gross advanced ticket sales increased by 40% to $700 million versus a build of $500 million in the prior quarter. On a net basis, this was partially offset by revenue recognized for sailings in the quarter and refunds and cancellations associated with Omicron. We continue to be encouraged by the strong and accelerating advanced ticket sales build as it reflects robust demand for our product as we bring the fleet back to service.  Turning to cash burn. Our monthly burn in the fourth quarter was $345 million, which was slightly better than our guidance of $350 million, despite some cost pressures from the global supply constraints. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we expect cash burn to increase to approximately $390 million as we ramp up to 85% of our capacity in operation by the end of the quarter. This cash burn includes costs incurred for ships coming online in the second quarter, such as crewing the fleet ahead of the restart, restocking of inventory and repositioning of certain ships to their initial home ports. As a reminder, and consistent with our prior commentary, cash burn does not include cash inflows associated with current or future bookings nor contribution from ships that have already restarted service. However, it is important to note that we expect cash inflows to accelerate as our fleet continues to come online, resulting in our cash flow from operations expected to turn positive in the second quarter.  Moving to the balance sheet. You may recall last quarter, we talked about pivoting to a more offensive approach as part of our financial recovery plan as shown on Slide 13. Since last quarter, our team has executed a series of transactions in November and February to begin the journey of optimizing our balance sheet. Let me share some key highlights with you, which are summarized on Slide 10.  In November 2021, we completed a series of balance sheet and cash flow optimization transactions, which reduced the company's annual interest expense, decreased leverage, extended the debt maturity profile and may lower diluted shares outstanding. Incrementally, in February, the company raised approximately $2.1 billion through a series of debt transactions. Proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem the remaining outstanding balances of the 12.25% senior secured notes due 2024 and the 10.25% senior secured notes due 2026 and will also be used to make principal and interest payments on scheduled amortization due in the near term.  This transaction extended our debt maturity profile and released certain collateral consisting of certain vessels, private islands and intellectual property. The combined benefit of these transactions reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $75 million. As is evident from the transactions I just covered, our treasury, accounting, finance and legal teams, amongst others, have been extremely busy. And I want to recognize and thank them for their tremendous amount of work and effort they put in for us to complete these transactions.  Turning to inflation. Similar to all other industries, we are experiencing upward pressure on costs in certain areas such as food, perishables and other supplies that are impacted by the global supply chain constraints. Recent geopolitical developments have also pushed fuel curves higher. However, as you can see on Slide 20, approximately 40% of our total consumption for 2022 and approximately 25% of our consumption for 2023 is hedged and affords us partial protection from the recent spike in prices. In addition, some of our major costs such as labor, also have a long term -- have long-term agreements, which provide predictability in our operating cost structure.  While inflationary pressures persist, the most recent consumer spending numbers remain robust. At a more micro level, we have seen clear evidence of this in the onboard spend from guests aboard our ships and pricing for future cruises that Frank touched on earlier. In fact, onboard spend per person per day continues to be up meaningfully versus record 2019 levels. We've also provided incremental guidance on certain key metrics like depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures, all of which can be referenced on Slide 21.  As I look ahead, I am encouraged by the continued positive news we are seeing, including the decline in COVID cases, the new guidance provided to the cruise industry by the CDC and the steady march back to normalcy in wider society. We are confident that the demand for our fantastic brands and unparalleled vacation experiences will continue strengthening back to pre-pandemic levels. This strength is clearly reflected in our forward booked position for the second half of 2022 and full year 2023. And our growth profile over the coming years is as robust as ever as we take delivery of 9 spectacular and margin-accretive ships across all 3 brands between now and 2027, increasing our capacity by 50% compared to 2019. More importantly, this management team has time and again generated outsized returns on incremental capacity. And we look to continue this trend as we focus on rebuilding and growing our business.  Lastly, Frank touched on this, and I couldn't agree more, that a business is only as strong as the people behind it. Our team has demonstrated incredible resilience working through these unprecedented times. We are undoubtedly stronger today than we were before entering the trenches of this pandemic. So as we look to the future, our team is focused on managing the controllable and staying nimble. As the landscape evolves, we will continue to adapt and create value for our shareholders, team members and communities we serve. Our management team is ready and eager to return our business back to pre-pandemic levels of significant cash flow generation and profitability combined with a strong balance sheet.  With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. And before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which Slide 14 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of this program. And we reached several important milestones this past year, including releasing our first ESG report announcing our long-term climate action strategy and goal to reach carbon neutrality. We also made several advances since just our last earnings call. We took the opportunity during the voyage suspension period to accelerate installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems or scrubbers nearly 2 years ahead of schedule. We successfully completed our nearly $200 million multiyear investment that covered 13 ships, representing approximately 70% of our operational capacity with these state-of-the-art systems, which improved our environmental footprint by significantly reducing emissions, including sulfur oxides and improving air quality. In fact, ships equipped with this technology can reduce SOx emissions by up to 98%, allowing the ships to operate these systems within compliance in expanded areas throughout the world. Investments in technology such as scrubbers are an integral part of our climate action strategy.  We were also proud to be recognized as a leader in sustainable cruise terminal construction as we were the first in the world to receive the LEED Gold New Construction certification for our flagship terminal at PortMiami. The team designed our 188,000-square foot terminal, which welcomed guests for the first time last year, with innovation and sustainability at the forefront, creating a platform that optimizes the terminal's energy performance, indoor air quality, water efficiency, utilization of local materials and resources and much more. And we will continue to innovate towards our sustainability commitment, including further investment at our PortMiami terminal, where we are partnering with Miami-Dade County to add short power capabilities by fall of 2023.  We know that initiatives such as these are important in supporting our goals. And our Board of Directors recognizes that ESG is a critical driver in achieving our corporate goals and long-term success. And for this reason, our Compensation Committee included an ESG metric in our annual short-term incentive plan for the first time. This metric involves the company making sufficient progress in setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets during 2022 as determined by the Technology, Environmental, Safety and Security, or TESS, Committee of the Board of Directors. Our Board believes that this step towards shared accountability across the organization reinforces our commitment and ultimate goal of reaching carbon neutrality.  Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 15. First, we remain focused on our voyage resumption plan with 85% of our fleet operational at the end of the quarter and the full fleet ready for the important peak summer season in May. Despite the impacts of Delta and Omicron, we are pleased with our cumulative booked position for 2022 and 2023 and the strong corresponding pricing that comes with it. And lastly, our priority remains to execute on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plans and to capitalize on our attractive growth profile over the coming years.  We've covered quite a bit today in what has been an incredibly busy quarter and year. So I'll conclude our commentary now and open up the call for your questions. Operator? Operator : . Our first question is from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So Frank and Mark, I guess, if I look at your daily -- your per diems, they were up, if my math is correct, somewhere around 20% relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. And if I compare those to some of your competitors, which again I might -- I know it's not directly apples-to-apples. But your competitors seem to be more in that low to mid-single-digit range. So I guess, the question is what drove those per diems so much higher, not only over 2019 but also versus your competitors as well? Frank Del Rio : And thanks for the question. Look, it goes back to our core going-to-market principle of market to fill and not discounting to fill. At this stage of the recovery, having 4 or 5 more points of occupancy at the expense of lower pricing, which could have a very negative long-term effect on the brand's equity, is not the right move. And so it wasn't hard for us to resist following others and dropping prices to levels that I've never seen before. And so we were happy to see a year-over-year or '21 compared to 2019 improvement in ticket NPDs by roughly 10%. Onboard spend was over the top. And you're right, on a combined basis, our total net revenue on an NPD basis was up over 20%. Some of our competitors had flat improvement. So we're very pleased with that. And we think that if you're a long-term investor, and certainly we're a long-term management team, you would prefer maintaining that pricing structure, that pricing power that we've demonstrated, not just now during a pandemic, but year-after-year, as you know, we lead the industry in ticket yields and in onboard revenue yields in exchange for a couple of points of occupancy in a period where even the best of the operators are performing at roughly half of what they normally would. So we'll take that trade any day. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And then second question, I'm going to ask this in a way, I hope isn't offensive or get you in trouble. But honestly, I think if we look at some of the changes the CDC has made relative to the cruise industry versus other forms of travel, I mean, to us, they honestly still seem somewhat archaic and outdated relative to what you guys are already doing from a protocol perspective. So the question is, I guess, why did you guys opt in to this program as it still seems somewhat outdated? Or is there a confirmation from them that you guys are on the right path and they're essentially going to leave you guys alone moving forward? Frank Del Rio : It's not going to get me in trouble at all, Steve, because I've been very vocal throughout the pandemic as to the disappointment that we've all suffered at the hands of the CDC. The CDC didn't shut down any other industry for nearly 18 months. And the CDC continues to have policies towards us that are not seen anywhere in the industry, but we are making progress with them. I will tell you that it was not an easy decision to opt in.  But we think that overall, given where we are now with the prevalence, where we are with the pandemic and the CDC's commitment to continually look at protocol much more online, real-time basis, so to speak, gives us hope that this first step of a volunteer program, where masking is no longer required and a few other guest-facing improvements, that, that will get us to where we need to go. And so there's going to be another date in the near future where the CDC will once again evaluate the protocols that we're now volunteering to comply with. But look, at the end of the day, we've always exceeded whatever the CDC's guidelines are. I don't need the CDC to tell me how to operate a safe cruise line. And our protocols have always exceeded theirs and continue to do so. At the end of the day, we need to build consumer confidence, and I think we're doing that.  As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the pandemic is waning in several areas, vaccinations are up, the severity of the cases are down. And we as a society are learning to live with this. And I think the CDC is mindful of that and wants to get away from being seen as discriminatory towards the cruise industry and being behind the times. So I think that in the near future, we're going to see a much more friendly environment towards the cruise industry from the CDC. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : With the new protocols, how should we think about the path to higher occupancy? And as we look out to 2023, will you generally be all the way back to kind of the typical over 100% occupancy? Or could you still see some lingering social distancing or other measures that you would want to kind of continue? Frank Del Rio : Look, I think that it's too soon to know exactly. I think we're moving in the right direction with COVID overall. We've had to endure two surges, Delta and Omicron, back-to-back. That certainly shook the confidence of society as a whole. If you recall last June, when the vaccines were readily available and the case count was really dropping, business was booming. I remember calling my brand presidents into a meeting and asking them to raise prices, stop marketing, do whatever they've got to do to slow down the sales volume because we were going to end up the year without having an inventory to sell.  And then Delta came along. And just when we were getting out of Delta, Omicron came along. But as we said in our prepared remarks, Steve, the back half of '22, in spite of Delta and Omicron, is in line with the record year of 2019 and 2023 is meaningfully ahead both in price and in load factor. So we believe that -- if you believe that the Omicron is the last major surge that's going to cause upheaval in everyday life, then that healing period that I referred to has begun. And I suspect that unless there is another surge -- and by the way, the experts that we talk to, including Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, doesn't believe that there will be another major surge. There will be variants. There will be mutations. But quite frankly, they will be more endemic than they are pandemic. And so I believe that 2023, based on the numbers that I have in the books right now, both load factor and pricing and further based on the assumption that we will not see another major Delta or Omicron-type surge, 2023 can get the industry and certainly our company back to pre-pandemic levels. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And then you had some helpful details on the change in itineraries by region, I think focusing on more Europe, Alaska. I guess, how will that impact net yields, kind of all else equal, looking at 2022, especially the second half versus 2019? And how are you planning for places like Australia and Asia Pacific, given some more stringent COVID policies? Frank Del Rio : Yes. Look, as you've heard me say many, many times, the #1 driver of yield is itineraries. And we strive every day to position our 28 vessels, soon to be 29, in the highest and best use for them. And so constantly, year-after-year, we lead the industry in ticket yields and onboard revenue yields and in total yields. And we think that will continue.  In the back half of '22 compared to 2019, for example, we will have Encore for the entire year compared to 1 month in 2019. We'll have Regent Splendor for the full year versus 0 months in 2019. And we will have the new Norwegian Prima for about 5 months in 20 -- back half of '22 compared to 0. So those three vessels, all very high-yielding, as Mark mentioned, improvements to margin, will continue to give us the ability to drive higher and higher industry record yields. And in terms of Australia and in Asia, in general, as you know, those are the last geographic areas to come online after the pandemic. We believe that they will be online. Certainly, I believe Australia and New Zealand will be, I'm not sure about China. China, quite frankly, is an insignificant area for us. But we are hopeful that the likes of Thailand and Singapore and Vietnam do reopen in time for the winter '22/'23 season. So we still have 9, 10 months to go before that season begins. Hopefully, as the pandemic winds down and finds its way through that Asian geographic area, that those countries and those ports will reopen to us. Mark Kempa : Steve, this is Mark. As we look to 2023, it's also important to remember that we're set up extremely well. As Frank said, we have essentially almost 5 additional vessels that will be operating the full year or roughly 20% more capacity than 2019. And if we look at those vessels and the economics of those vessels, we know they're a big driver to bottom line profitability and margin accretion. So again, assuming a normal year, we are set up extremely well in terms of our profile. Operator : Our next question comes from James Hardiman with Citigroup. Sean Wagner : This is Sean Wagner on for James. I guess, on the topic of how should we think of the per berth net cruise costs, excluding fuel, as we ramp the fleet over the course of the year? And is there an opportunity to match or improve on those numbers as we look to 2023? Or I guess, is there any way to think about kind of margin potential at similar yields or similar revenue levels? Mark Kempa : Sure. This is Mark. So look, we're thinking about that every day, like any business, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we, too, have pressures like the rest of the world. That also comes along -- comes together with stronger top line. But this is a relatively fixed cost business. So we're lucky that we're afforded some protection on that front. That said, as we look as a comparable base back to 2019 and you think about it on a per unit cost basis, we do have more efficient capacity coming on. We do have more growth. So that's going to give us some opportunity there. To the extent some of that is offset by continued inflationary pressures, that remains to be seen. We have started -- we were -- prior to today or yesterday, we were starting to see some settling on the cost side. So we'll have to see how this recent geopolitical event impacts that. But all else equal, we should be gaining efficiencies. That said, keep in mind, we have not gotten rid of any of our older vessels during the pandemic. We have a relatively young fleet. And at this time, we have no plans to shed any of that capacity. So we won't have that optical benefit, so to speak, versus some of our competitors. And I highlight the word optical on that front, so -- but again, we've always run a lean company. We will get scale as we continue to bring -- to grow and bring on efficient capacity. And it's in our DNA to look at every cost, every line item and drive efficiencies where we can. Sean Wagner : That's very helpful. And I guess, on the yield end of it or the per diem specifically, how much of that premium that you're seeing, and I guess, the industry as a whole is seeing, is due to not having to kind of fill up ships to capacity? And kind of how much of that -- what do you think about your ability to maintain that strength as you do get closer to kind of historical levels of occupancy? Frank Del Rio : Well, as I mentioned earlier, the phenomena that you mentioned is not new in Q4. It's something that we've been able to achieve year after year after year. We lead the industry in yields, ticket yield, onboard revenue yield and we continue to do so, primarily because of our go-to-market strategy, where we believe in marketing to stimulate demand.  We believe in the product, you pay for what you get for. And we have three industry-leading brands, the highest luxury brand in Regent, the highest-yielding premium brand in Oceania and what we believe to be the highest contemporary yielding brand in Norwegian. So we're just going to continue doing what we always do because it's a winning strategy. Mark Kempa : And Sean, I think it's a bit of a fallacy to think that we're just getting these premium per diems as a result of lower capacity. Yes, there's some of that mix that impacts onboard revenue. Yes, we've said that in the past. But core, fundamental, solid ticket revenue, pricing is strong. We've maintained pricing. That's our strategy, market to fill. We're going to continue to do that. So it's not by accident that we're getting those premiums as a result of our self-imposed capacity limits. Operator : Our next question is from Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research. Frederick Wightman : There was a comment that some vessels could potentially be impacted just from geopolitics starting in late May. I'm wondering if you could maybe frame the potential impact either on a capacity basis, if that's easiest. Mark Kempa : Sure, Fred. So when we look at -- obviously, we're talking about the Baltic region, more specifically, St. Petersburg. As we look, we have roughly about 5% of our total capacity that calls on St. Petersburg over this course of the summer season. And that's heavily weighted more towards our Norwegian brand than Oceania or Regent. But it's -- all in all, it's about 50 sailings. And we are looking at alternative ports as we speak. I mean, this is something we've been thinking about. And worst-case scenario, if we're not able to call on St. Petersburg or the surrounding areas, there's plenty of other ports in the -- in that Scandinavian region that we have the ability to call on. So not a huge impact, obviously a bit disappointing because that is a premier port, but there's other viable, very attractive ports that are available. Frederick Wightman : Great. And then I guess, just conceptually, is this current situation something that you've seen actually reflected in booking trends over the past few days? Or is it still just sort of up and to the right post Omicron? Mark Kempa : Yes. Look, I think it's way too early. I mean, we definitely did not see anything as of close of business yesterday. And this morning, I haven't received -- we haven't received any red flags. But like anything, you'll probably see a little bit of slowdown here and there around margin. That's normal. But it's definitely too early to indicate if there's going to be any longer-term effects. Europe is a big continent, too. So this is affecting a very small portion of Europe. And there's a lot of other areas that we can operate in, especially the Med, where we have a significant capacity as well. Operator : Our next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Could you talk a little bit more about brand performance, maybe what you're seeing luxury high-end versus contemporary, anything, differences in booking patterns? And then your recent change that, I think, goes in effect March 1 regarding age under 12 allowed to be unvaccinated, I think that's a change from previously being 100% vaccinated. And on the contemporary brand, curious how that change is being received, if that's generating any new interest. Any thoughts there? Frank Del Rio : Vince, it's Frank. Look, the -- all three brands are performing very, very well. As you know from normal times, if you've been following this industry for a while, the upscale brands, Oceania and Regent, by the nature of their itineraries, their psychographic demographics, the customer base, those itineraries tend to book earlier than the more contemporary Norwegian brands.  In this business, everything else being equal, the longer the itinerary is, the more exotic the itinerary is, the further out people book. And we're certainly seeing that. And so we have great visibility into the second half of '22 and into '23 from -- especially from those two brands. And the news is just fantastic. As I said, we are in line with 2019, and 2019 was a heck of a year, and significantly ahead of -- for 2023 and at higher pricing. So I will tell you that the upscale market is very much alive and well as is Norwegian.  Now as far as Norwegian goes, we believe that the combination of allowing children under the age of 12 and no longer having to wear masks is a big boost to demand. We just announced it in the last couple of days. As I said earlier, business has been trending upward sequentially now for about 4 weeks. And we believe that this announcement will add fuel to that sequential improvement week-over-week in terms of net bookings. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And then I had a follow-up question on costs, specifically fuel. You talked earlier about installing more scrubbers. And I'm thinking back to pre-COVID times and with IMO 2020, the thought that the percentage of fuel that was MGO that you burn would have to step up, I think, it was to like 60% or something like that, which was pretty high. Now that you've kind of digested some of these changes, installed more scrubbers, what percent of fuel in 2022 do you think will be MGO? Mark Kempa : Yes. Roughly, we've now completed our exhaust gas scrubber installation recently. And when we look at our mix, we're settling out at about 50% HFO versus MGO, so right down the middle of the path, slightly better than what we were anticipating, which is good news. Operator : . Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. I wanted to ask about pricing. You showed your itinerary mix, which would be driving price increases with the higher mix in Alaska and Europe. Can you help us sort of think about the same-store increases in the Caribbean, just given the resort hotel rates on land, the types of increases we're seeing and how that may be looking for your kind of same-store Caribbean? And then just a follow-up, too, on the potential changes with Baltic ships. So just to clarify, are you saying that Baltic ships would not be moved to the Med, just thinking about potential impact, if there was that kind of change in the Med closer in? So you're saying that's not where Baltic ships would go? So I just want to clarify that, too. Frank Del Rio : Robin, it's Frank. No, the Baltic ships will stay in the Baltic. The Med ships will stay in the Med. What we said was if we cannot go to St. Petersburg, there are many alternative ports to visit in the surrounding countries. We also have the opportunity to overnight in another port so that we don't have to affect the length of the itinerary nor the embark or disembark. It is disappointing because St. Petersburg is one of the crown jewels of the Scandinavian itineraries. But certainly, there are alternatives. In terms of the Caribbean, look, we've seen strong pricing in the Caribbean. We -- as we move certain capacity out of the Caribbean and into higher-yielding itineraries, whatever is left for us, by definition, provides a lift to yield because we have less competition among ourselves. We also are seeing that with cost pressures affecting all businesses, it's also affecting the land resorts. They're having to charge more. And so our cruise, as the industry's presence in the Caribbean theater, we believe we're more competitive than ever. And it's allowing us at least to raise prices in the Caribbean. So we like the Caribbean, especially in the winter. But we're always tweaking our deployment such that we can move our vessels to what we believe are higher and higher yields, not just ticket yields but also onboard revenue yield. So for example, a vessel that might generate the same ticket yield in the same month in the Caribbean versus Alaska, you would probably want to move that ship to Alaska because we know historically, Alaska generates more onboard revenue.  So you've got to look at the total -- and I know that analysts and investors don't have the same visibility on onboard revenue yields as you do on ticket yields. But I've got to tell you, onboard revenue yield continues to grow, becoming more and more important as a part of the overall yield. And so we don't look at just ticket yields, which is itinerary-driven, but we also look at onboard revenue yield. And if you see it from our lens, you'll see why we are constantly tweaking our overall deployment and, on a net-net basis, are moving ships out of the Caribbean into places like Alaska and in Europe. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Frank, can you maybe help us understand the booking curve a little bit more? When you say back half of '22 and 2023 bookings are ahead of 2019, I guess, how much of your budgeted kind of back half of the year and forward year is typically filled right now? Just trying to get a sense of how much there is left to fill between now and the sell date. What -- how has that looked historically? Frank Del Rio : Well, there's still a lot to sell. As you know, we always say that we'd like to turn the year somewhere between 60% to 65%. Certainly, we didn't turn 2021 into '22 at that level because of Omicron and Delta for the full year. But it's like I said, in line for the back half. And certainly, today, based on what the booked position is for '23, reaching that 60%, even 65% for 2023 at year-end '22 looks very, very doable and at higher prices.  Again, it all boils down to is if you believe, as we do, that the pandemic is receding, that the healing process has begun and that momentum is picking up. We've now -- we saw momentum pick up last -- late last spring, when the original, I guess, it was called Alpha variant, was beginning to die down, only to be thwarted by the arrival of Delta in early July. And then just when we thought Delta was over in the October, November, we were cranking again. Then Omicron came. If you believe it's over, then we're at the cusp of that momentum, a hockey stick type of growth in net bookings arriving on the scene. And that's what we believe. And it's not because I believe it, but those who know better, our SailSAFE panel, the experts around the country, believe that the combination of Omicron receding, more and more people being vaccinated, more and more immunity in the -- in society, both in the U.S. and worldwide, the new therapeutics coming online, that the pandemic will soon turn into an endemic. In fact, there are countries now, Iceland, Denmark, who declared the end of the pandemic and an endemic arrival. So at this stage -- and again, not because I think, I'm giving you what the numbers are showing, 2023 could be -- assuming that no other major variants arise in the scene, could be a fabulous year, to be a record year. Andrew Didora : Got it. Mark, just a clarification on the operating cash flow guidance, when you say cash from operations will inflect positively in the second quarter, does that include your estimate for cash in from customer deposits? And then -- because I think does that differ from your cash burn definition in terms of excluding any deposits? Am I thinking about that right? Mark Kempa : Yes. Cash burn, we give the cash burn guidance to help you guys model. But cash flow from operations takes all that into account, all of your working capital changes, essentially write off your cash flow statement, cash flow from operations. So that's what we're referring to. There is no other definition of it, just a straight GAAP interpretation. Operator : Our next question is from Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Jaime Katz : My first question is on marketing ROI and how you guys are planning on your marketing spend over 2022, given the lift obviously that you have seen in spend so far. And then just a clarification, I think in your prepared remarks, you had articulated that some of the refinancing had maybe given you availability to tap into the secured debt markets again if you chose to do so. I just wanted to make sure I heard that correct. Mark Kempa : Jaime, yes, you are correct. So with completion of our recent transaction, the series of debt transactions that -- where we raised $2.1 billion, we did free up collateral on two of our vessels as well, as I said, all of our islands and, of course, the all-sacred intellectual property. So going forward, we do have secured capacity in addition to what we just issued in the course of the last 2 to 3 weeks. And I think your first part of the question was on marketing spend. Look, we -- as we've always said, we market to fill. And that's demonstrated in our pricing. We demonstrated it in Q4. We will market where needed. We're always looking for an ROI on our marketing, of course. There's a portion of marketing that is agnostic, where you just have to spend, where you can't necessarily pinpoint an ROI, right? You have to get a certain amount of load on the ships.  But beyond that, it's very pointed. Our marketing groups are very sophisticated in that aspect. And if we can spend $1 of marketing and get a 5 to 10x return, we'll do that all day long. And we watch that. We look at that. Our brand presidents from each area of each brand do that day in, day out. So again, we will market to fill. And that's the important strategy. Frank Del Rio : One thing I'll add to what Mark just said, Jaime, is that we recognized very early in the Omicron wave that consumers were not -- cruising was not top of mind in consumers' mind in December and January. So we pulled back our marketing spend considerably at the end of '21 and early '22, believing that it would not have been as effective as it would in other times. So we've got plenty of dry powder that we're going to be deploying over the next few weeks and months ahead as we rev up the marketing machine to get to the booking levels we need to generate the booked position we want. So we did two very smart things. Maybe we were a lot more lucky than smart, but we didn't drop prices. And that's by design because that's just not what we do. And number two, we were able to recognize that Omicron was going to have an impact on consumer behavior. And we reduced our marketing spend during that 8-week period or so. And so we come out of it with plenty of dry powder to deploy now in a more favorable environment. Well, thank you, everyone, as always, for your time and for your support. We will be available to answer any questions you might have throughout the day. And I wish you a good day, and a healthy and safety stay. Thank you so much. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Business Update and First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob and I'll be your operator. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. . I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, Rob and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's investor relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release, with the first quarter 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our investor relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Jessica and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the last few days, our company marked a significant milestone if not the most significant milestone thus far in our great come cruise back. This past Saturday Norwegian Spirit welcomed guests for the first time since our fleet wide pause in operations Back in March of 2020. And in doing so, she became the final ship in our 28 ship fleet to return to service making Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings the first major cruise operator to have all its ships operating again. The last two years and certainly the last few months have been challenging to say the least. But with each new challenge that arose to further complicate an already colossal undertaking, the team at Norwegian stepped up to the plate time and again to demonstrate our extraordinary resilience, dedication and passion.  So I want to thank each and every team member across our organization from shipboard to shore side for all their efforts to reach this point in our Great Cruise Comeback and position our company to thrive in the years to come. Even more impressive was our team's ability to drive some of the high guest satisfaction scores ever, ticket revenue and onboard spend in our history, and this trend has persisted, even as we ramp up occupancy having more guests across all brands, all Itinerary and in all cabin classes.  We have reached this milestone with a clear, consistent and focused strategy throughout our relaunch. And showing that we do not prioritize short-term gains at the expense of jeopardizing our long-term brand equity and industry leading pricing in the process. First, we have prioritized the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and the communities we visit above all else, doing everything possible to create a safe and healthy experience for all stakeholders.  Since launching our Great Cruise Comeback, we have carried over 500,000 guests, and we continue to experience significantly lower COVID incident rate aboard our ships, as compared to the population at large, indicating that our health and safety protocols are indeed working as designed. Second and throughout the pandemic, we provided steadfast support both to our guests and travel partners focusing on doing the right thing and demonstrating our willingness to go to great lengths to support them. And I don't think this commitment has gone unnoticed. I firmly believe that as we exit the pandemic, our three brands will be in better standing than ever before with these key partners, the travel public at large and with our key past guests. And lastly we have stood firm on our go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill and maintaining price integrity by emphasizing value over price. You have heard me say time and time again that we will not sacrifice our industry-leading pricing to temporarily bolster our load factors and I continue to stand behind that philosophy. Pricing will be the primary driver to net yield growth, as we exit the pandemic and return to a normalized booking performance, this outperformance will be key. And given that consistent net yield growth is the single most important factor in maximizing high quality and sustainable profitability, this is an area where we will not compromise our efforts. So while our first quarter load factor was somewhat tempered, our net per diem growth over first quarter of 2019 record pricing was, as shown on Slide 5, significant, a trade-off and an outcome that is much more meaningful for the company's long-term success. Now, you don't have to take my word for it, our pre-pandemic track record of stellar net yield outperformance year-after-year speaks for itself.  As you can see on Slide 6 in 2019, our net yields were better than our peers by somewhere between 20% to 40%. This historical outperformance coupled with the strong pricing we are experiencing for all future periods are evidence that our strategy is a superior one and the best way to protect our brand equity, while driving long-term shareholder value. Taking a step back to survey the broader landscape, today we find ourselves in a much more favorable public health regulatory and demand environment than when we last spoke a little over two months ago.  We have witnessed a continued relaxation of COVID-related protocols across the globe from air travel to concert and other indoor activities and this time around the cruise industry is an active participant. First, we are pleased that in late March, the CDC entirely removed its travel Health notices for cruise, representing a significant step towards leveling the playing field between cruise and our land-based counterparts.  In addition the CDC continues to modify elements of its voluntary framework for cruise, relaxing certain requirements, the most recent of which includes reducing required vaccination threshold from 95% to 90%, which further opens up the important family market to cruising. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen an acceleration in the reopening of society to pre-pandemic normalcy, which bodes well for travel and leisure sector overall. More ports around the world have opened to cruise and we have seen travel restrictions relapse in many areas. And while there are still regions where discussions to reopen to Cruise are ongoing, particularly certain countries in Asia, the good news is that we do not have ship sailing in those regions, until the fourth quarter, giving us additional time to monitor the situation, plan for various outcomes and be ready to adapt as needed. And lastly, we are seeing an explosive showing by consumers, particularly American consumers. Consumer spend is strong, snapping back and even exceeding where we left off in 2019. Gone are the days where the family budget was going to anti-bacterial wipes, hand sanitizer, delivery app,  and streaming services. Consumers today are spending to catch up on over two years of missed experiences. One example of this that we see every day is hotel ADRs and airlines fares, which are at or near record levels. And now with our full fleet back up and running and our industry's overwhelming advantage in its value proposition over land-based options, we along with the entire cruise industry are well-positioned to capitalize on this pent-up demand. While the public health environment improved over the course of the quarter, the start of the Russia Ukraine conflict did cause additional disruptions across the world and to our business and you can see on Slide 7. First and foremost, we continue to hope for a peaceful resolution, which minimizes further impact for those in the region.  Our motto is family first, and as such, we have focused on assisting our impacted shipboard and shore side team members as best we can. We have activated our crew relief fund and are providing logistical, communication and mental health support to affected team members. In addition, we also provided a sizable donations to Save the Children of Ukraine crisis relief fund and invited partners, including guests travel partners and team members to contribute as well. Prior to the conflict approximately 10% of our annual capacity across our three brands was scheduled to sail in the Baltic region with approximately 5% calling on Saint Petersburg, Russia. We subsequently canceled or modified approximately 60 sailings which included all calls to ports in Russia for 2022. And in a move that demonstrates, one of the unique strength of our industry, we quickly redeployed three ships scheduled to operate in the region to sail alternate itinerary. Oceania Marina, Regent Seven Seas Mariner will remain in Europe sailing British Isles and Northern European itineraries respectively. Meanwhile, Norwegian Getaway was redeployed to Port Canaveral to take advantage of pent-up close-in domestic demand which despite the condensed booking window has already meaningfully exceeded our occupancy expectations. And in a preemptive measure our three brands will pause all calls to Russia from the 2023 and 2024 itineraries. While this is not an ideal scenario, we are once again demonstrating our ability to pivot as needed in response to exogenous events. Now turning to Slide 8, we shift today's discussions to our broader booking and demand trends. Overall, we continue to experience sequentially improving underlying demand and robust pricing for all future periods. The Omicron surge in December and January did indeed impact net booking momentum with the vast majority of cancellations concentrated for close-in sailings.  The tide began to turn in mid-January when net booking volumes began to show week-over-week improvement. As booking regained momentum, we experienced another temporary setback with the emergence of the Russian Ukraine conflict. This impact was also short-lift and was mainly concentrated in the Baltic region with some leakage to surrounding Mediterranean sailing, with cancellations returning to pre-conflict levels by the end of the first quarter.  Overall net booking volumes have continued to improve sequentially, returning to and recently surpassing pre-Omicron level and currently at levels approaching that pace needed to consistently sail at historical pre-pandemic load factors. As a result of the impact from Omicron and the Russia Ukraine conflict, second half 2022 book position is now below an extraordinarily strong 2019. As we look further out in the year, the picture improves sequentially with book position in the fourth quarter remaining in line with 2019. More importantly cumulative full year 2023 book position is ahead of 2019 and ahead of pre-pandemic 2020 at a comparable point in the booking curve. On the all-important pricing front, as mentioned earlier, our go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill, versus discounting to fill and emphasizing value over price is paying off in droves, with pricing meaningfully higher for all future periods when compared to the comparable pre-pandemic periods. This holds true even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits in 2022, which as a reminder will no longer be a headwind in 2023 as FCCs must be applied to sailings through year-end 2022. As the booking environment improves, we will continue our strategic marketing effort in order to further stoke demand to obtain quality, high price, and high value bookings. With each month that goes by our recovery trajectory becomes a little clear. 2022 is no doubt a transition year. But as I look towards 2023, I'm excited by the full potential that future holds. We are still operating in an uncertain environment and if we've learned anything in today's return to normalcy will certainly not happen overnight and possibly not without additional bumps in the road. But with each passing day I'm increasingly confident that we are reaching the milestones needed to propel us forward in this recovery. We are doing everything in our control to position us for sustained long-term success and we are laying the foundation needed to set the company up for an extremely strong year in 2023 and beyond. But where we sit today, and without another Black Swan event derailing our plans there is a reasonable and clear path to reach record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA levels in 2023. Boosted by the introduction of four new ships across our three brands over the next 18 months, our goal, our entire team is focused on achieving. As just mentioned, the key components of the future success will be our industry leading growth profile with nine new ships coming online across our three brands through 2027. The first of these ships Norwegian Prima will join our fleet in just a few short months as you can see on Slide 9. After her record sales debut in May of 2021, her booking volumes continued to be stellar and her pricing significantly outpacing our past new ship launches. In March, we announced that pop icon, Katy Perry will serve as the godmother to Prima and will be the headline entertainer at her christening ceremony in Reykjavik, Iceland. This announcement garnered significant media coverage further building on the excitement surrounding Prima and allowing us to reach a new to cruise audience.  As we look to next year 2023 will be the first year that each of our brands will be welcoming new capacity, the additions of Norwegian Viva, Oceania Cruises Vista and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur to our fleet.  These new hardware introductions are meaningful driver not only in net yield growth and overall profitability but also in attracting new guests to our brands and reigniting loyal past guests to enjoy new and elevated experiences. They also have historically had a significant a halo effect in the rest of our fleet. Needless to say I'm ready and eager to begin welcoming these additional premium capacity to our fleet, which we expect will be meaningful contributors to our top and bottom line financial results. I'll be back with closing comments a little later, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Kempa for his commentary on our financial positions. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you Frank, and good morning everyone. Before I begin my commentary on our financial results and outlook, I would like to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to our truly top notch team for the successful execution of our return to service plan. Their hard work, collaboration and innovative spirit are unmatched and their efforts have been critical to getting us to the significant milestone with all ships now officially back to revenue service. Turning to the first quarter results, strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue spend drove positive contribution from the fleet that operated in the quarter despite headwinds we faced from the Omicron variant. During the quarter, we canceled approximately 60 sailings due to Omicron-related operational disruptions from additional travel restrictions, increased health and safety protocols and port closures.  This impact, coupled with our focus on maintaining price integrity for the long-term resulted in slightly lower than anticipated load factors in the quarter. However, pricing remained robust in the quarter and onboard spend per person per day continues to be up meaningfully versus record 2019 levels.  Looking ahead, load factors are also improving sequentially each month and we expect second quarter load factors to come in at approximately 65%. This will continue to build throughout the year and we expect to reach historical load factor levels in the first half of 2023, and at record pricing, staying consistent with our go-to-market strategy and protecting the long-term pricing strength of our brands. In addition, we are experiencing an uptick in bookings for close-in sailings which not only help organically boost near term load factors, but more importantly are a positive indicator that consumer confidence is building, as these bookings are typically within the cancellation penalty period. Turning to our financial performance, slide 10 lays out our expectations for upcoming key financial milestones. In March, we reached a significant inflection point in our financial recovery with operating cash flow, turning slightly positive for the month, ahead of our previous projections, which we expect will continue throughout the second quarter.  This momentum should continue to gain steam as we progress through the year with both positive operating cash flow and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the second half of 2022. This sets us up nicely to achieve our goal of record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023. Moving to Slide 11, our cash balance for the quarter increased by approximately $390 million on a net basis to $2.1 billion. This reflects $1.1 billion of cash burn associated with operations, including interest and capital expenditures partially offset by nearly $600 million of advanced ticket sale collections and other working capital changes.  Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was also boosted by an incremental $925 million associated with the balance sheet optimization transactions, we executed in February. Our overall liquidity remains strong, standing at $3.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, which positions us well to manage the resumption of debt amortization and newbuild related payments, which were deferred during the pandemic, the former of which resumed beginning last month. With all ships now sailing and the cash generation increasing month after month, our current trajectory would indicate that we are confident we can fund our operations organically. A key component of this cash generation is our advanced ticket sales build, which continues to accelerate.  As you can see on Slide 13, total ATS balance stood at $2.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter, up over $400 million versus the prior quarter. On a gross basis, ATS build increased by 60% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time since the start of the pandemic and approaching pre-pandemic levels. This is another positive indicator demonstrating strong consumer demands for our brands. Turning to cash burn, our monthly burn in the quarter was approximately $375 million better than our guidance of $390 million despite some cost pressures from inflation and global supply chain constraints. This cash burn figure does not include cash inflows associated with current or future bookings nor contributions from ships that have already resumed service. Moving to the balance sheet, as part of our financial recovery plan shown on Slide 14, our team is focused day in and day out on finding and seizing opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and maximize value for our shareholders. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2.1 billion through a series of debt transactions.  Proceeds from these transactions, were used to redeem the remaining outstanding balances of the high cost 12.25% senior notes due 2024 and the 10.25% senior secured notes due 2026, which we incurred, out of necessity at the peak of the pandemic. The remaining proceeds of approximately $925 million will be used to make principal and interest payments on scheduled debt amortization due in the short term. These transactions extended our debt maturity profile and released certain collateral and guarantees. The combined benefit of these transactions coupled with those completed late last year, as laid out on Slide 15 reduced our annual cash interest expense by approximately $75 million. As I've touched on in the last few quarters, consistent with what all other industries are also experiencing, inflation in global supply chain constraints, continue to put upward pressure on our cost. Fuel prices have risen significantly accelerated by the ongoing geopolitical unrest. While we are not immune to the spike in pricing our hedge program. As shown on Slide 24, provides partial protection. On the labor front, we remain relatively better positioned than our land-based peers due to our long-term employment agreements, which provide for stable wage inflation and predictability in our operating cost structure. We've also provided incremental guidance on key certain metrics like depreciation and amortization, interest, fuel consumptions, and capital expenditures all which can be found on Slide 25. Looking ahead we are gearing up to deliver on our attractive newbuild program. This transformational growth is an under-appreciated cornerstone of our company's investment thesis. Compared to 2019 the addition to our fleet of nine new ships through 2027 results in a 50% capacity growth versus 2019, as shown on Slide 16. This also reflects the additions of both Norwegian Encore in late 2019 and Regent Seven Seas Splendor in early 2020. These new ships are expected to be top line and margin accretive with very efficient financing structures, resulting in an expected immediate boost to our profitability. As we have showed you in the past slide 22 demonstrates how this management team has time and again generated outsized returns on incremental capacity, a trend we fully expect to continue in the future. Another area where we can drive additional value for our stakeholders is our multi-year strategy to capture additional share of the leisure wallet. Cruise vacations, continue to offer a unique and incredible compelling value proposition for consumers versus land based vacation alternatives. In the past, we have said that a cruise typically offers at least 22% to 30% better value than a similar land-based alternative. With the current inflationary backdrop, that gap has widened making our value proposition even more compelling today than ever before. Without the same labor pressures many of our land-based peers are facing, we can also provide a consistent and exceptional level of service to our guests as evidenced by our high guest satisfaction scores. These factors combined, present another opportunity for us to both drive additional demand and increased prices. Stepping back and looking at the bigger long term picture, I am optimistic, not only because of the progress we have made so far in our recovery, but also by our future prospects.  Each new milestone we reach is another stepping stone, as we push forward in our recovery process. And as I touched on, we have several significant catalysts to generate value, beyond simply targeting a return to our pre-pandemic performance. We are focused on controlling what we can control, and finding new and innovative ways, however, big or small to improve each day. I am confident that our strong culture of operational and financial excellence and disciplined, which served us well in the past and through the challenges of the pandemic will serve us even more in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Frank for closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you very much, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks this morning, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain. And as Slide 17 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. We have made several significant advances since our last earnings call. First, we announced last month that we are pursuing net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050s. This ambition spans our entire operation and value chain as we aim to bring all of our key partners along with us on this important journey. To support our path to net zero we have also committed to develop short and near term greenhouse gas reduction targets.  These new commitments broaden and strengthen our existing and continually evolving climate action strategy, which is centered around three key focus areas. First, reducing our carbon intensity. Second, investing in technology and exploring alternative fuels. And third, implementing a carbon offset program. We will continue to monitor investing opportunities to reduce emissions including and beyond our fleet, working closely with our vendor partners to accelerate decarbonization efforts.  A key driver to achieve our net zero ambition is the development of alternative fuels along with the associated critical infrastructure at destinations globally to support the usage of these fields and to accelerate the use of shore power while in ports. We will continue to partner and research to identify appropriate alternative fuel sources that can also be sufficiently scaled. For example, we are currently actively engaging with partners, including shipyards, engine manufacturers and classification society in exploring paths for the development of additional technology including potential Hybrid Engine solutions and safe and effective methanol engine retrofits. Second, last month, we published our first task force on climate related financial disclosures or TCFD Report. As part of this process, we engaged teams across the organization to conduct an extensive climate risk screening, identifying priority climate related risks, followed by a scenario analysis on our top risks under different hypotheticals climate scenarios. We are focused on improving resiliency and the result of this assessment will assist us in further integrating climate related risks into our long-term strategy and decision-making processes. Lastly, I'm pleased to report that I signed the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity Inclusion in March, further expanding our commitment to fostering an inclusive workforce where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to generate and execute on innovative ideas. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 18. First, we are incredibly be pleased to have our full fleet back in operation, so we can now singularly focus on ramping up occupancies in a disciplined and brand accretive manner with the goal of reaching record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023. The public health and regulatory environment has improved and I am encouraged by the current trajectory and the overall progress we have made as a society in learning how to adapt and live with the virus, allowing us to accelerate our return to normalcy.  Second, we are encouraged by the improving booking trends and robust pricing we are experiencing, which lay a strong foundation for second half of '22 and 2023. We will lean our fundamental go-to-market strategy of market to fill in order to set the stage now for a high-quality sustainable long-term profitability and free cash flow generation. And lastly, we will continue to execute on our medium and long-term recovery plan and to capitalize on our attractive growth profile over the coming years. As you can see, we've covered a lot today. So I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call all your question. Rob, please open up the line. Operator : Thank you, Frank. . Our first question comes from Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Steve Wieczynski : Yeah, hey guys, good morning. So Frank and Mark, want to ask about your ability to take price moving forward. One of the questions we get a lot from investors is the long-term pricing power of your company and the industry in general. And you guys obviously have remained underpriced relative to a lot of other vacation alternatives. And the fear is with disruptions like you're seeing with Russia, Ukraine having to redeploy those assets elsewhere, coupled with a decent amount of new supply those types of factors might keep your pricing ability more in check. So just trying to understand how you how you think about price ability or price action ability and how you going to combat those fears that are out there? Frank Del Rio : Thanks, Steve. I think it's a great question, especially because we rely on pricing to performance as well as we do both top line and bottom line. And one of the drivers of that future pricing out performance is going to be the nine new vessels we've coming online.  We have the most growth coming online percentage wise. I think as Mark mentioned 50% in '23 over 2019. And as you know new vessels, especially the new generation of the Norwegian vessels, the new generation of the Oceania vessels and the last of the Regent vessels, they're all incredibly productive in terms of being able to raise prices. No question that the conflict in the Ukraine does have a damping effect on pricing. St. Petersburg, Russia was a star port. We probably won't be going there anytime soon. But coupled with the new vessels coming online, you know of our history. I think it's one of the slide of our history of outperforming the industry in net yield growth year after year after year. Go-to-market strategy of market to fill as opposed to discount to fill is not a slogan. It's something we do every day.  We take it very seriously being the smallest of the three big cruise companies. We don't have the scale to control cost as well as some others might. We went our game based on our ability to drive top line revenue and the key to driving top line revenue is pricing. And so we have the best and the brightest in our company focused on that and we believe that we'll be able to continue to outperform in that area for years to come. Mark Kempa : And Steve, to add to what Frank is saying, we can't overlook as we talk about the value proposition of Cruise. We've always said that Cruise is underpriced versus our true competitors, which are land-based vacations. And as you've seen consumers more and more willing to pay higher pricing for land based alternatives, that is additional demand and additional pricing that we can go after. And we expect to go after.  We'll continue to chase that and that's an opportunity for the industry as a whole. If you look, go back and look at 2008 and 2009, what happened in pricing after the last recession, pricing rebounded quickly and I think we were the first in the industry. A couple of our brands never lost pricing power and our largest brand at the time was the first to rebound. So we're set up well. We think there is continued opportunity down the line. Consumers are willing to pay for value and cruise offers a compelling value. Steve Wieczynski : That's great color. Thank you, both. And second question, probably a bigger picture question is something I've asked some of your peers as well, but it's probably relevant to what's going on right now with the equity markets and clearly there is a fear out there the U.S. is heading into some type of correction or recession or whatever you want to look at it. Just want to understand how you guys think you're positioned at this point, both from a, what we call kind of a financial and liquidity position, as well as your business general. And maybe help us think about how you guys have performed in the past during tougher economic times. And if you see any scenario on what you would need to raise additional liquidity? Thank you. Mark Kempa : Steve, I'll take that. So, first and foremost, let's remember we have a few inflection points that we just hit as a company. Our positive cash flow from operations turned in March. We expect that to continue in the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year. As I showed in our slide, we expect free cash flow to turn positive in the fourth quarter.  So all that plays in well, when we look at our liquidity position. We turned the quarter with around $3.1 billion. And as I talked about not only turning the corner on cash flow, but our advanced ticket sales engine is roaring. And so when you look at that and are we're pretty confident in our ability to fund our operations organically.  When you look at the bigger picture against the economic backdrop, of whether it's inflation or recession talk, as you think about the cruise industry and our company as a whole, against an inflationary backdrop, we're relatively better positioned than many of our land-based competitors due to the fixed-cost nature of our business. So that gives us an advantage. And again I'll go back to what I said in the beginning of your question that combined with the value proposition of cruise, consumers look for that. So we feel like we're in a great position going forward. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Great thanks guys, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Vince Ciepiel : Great thanks. Helpful comments there and interesting goal on the '23 net yield, I think you had also mentioned a record year for EBITDA and I'm sure that unit growth's, part of that, but I wanted to get your perspective on profitability within that.  Obviously there has been inflation across the business. A lot of companies are dealing with this now, but you guys have made some efficiency improvements through COVID, rolling out additional capacity to leverage some land-based fixed cost. So curious kind of how you're thinking about margins into next year in light of those moving pieces? Frank Del Rio : Yeah, good morning, Vince, it's Frank. Look, it all starts with record pricing. Today, we said that our 2023 book position meaningfully ahead of what we were last year. Pricing meaningfully ahead of where we are last year. We can hold meaning no more Black Swan events. We think that there will be margin expansion led not only by the pricing we're seeing. But by the introduction of four new ships.  We were in a way lucky that we didn't take delivery of any new ships during the pandemic, but over the next 18 months, we take delivery of four. And so we think like we've seen historically, new ship introductions are real tailwind to net yield growth to profitability, the topline revenue. Inflation is an ugly word, but there is a pretty side, which is pricing power. And you've heard Mark's statements this morning along with mine, that we do have pricing power, not only in absolute terms but in relative terms compared to land-based resorts and other vacation options. So we think that in the absence of more Black Swan events, and we've had more Black Swan events in the last two years, than I think we've had in the prior 20. 2023, indeed, it could be the record year that we're seeing unfolding before us. Mark Kempa : And Vince, we're not only unit growth, as we said in 2023 and we effectively have a 20% capacity growth over '19. We're going to drive the top line, but on the cost side, you have to remember, that if you look at our costs, we're not immune to inflation, but about 25% to 30% of our cost basket is exposed to that hyperinflation so to speak. That's a lot less than many are comparable type of that leisure industries, so of speak. So we have some protection against that backdrop. We're going to continue to push on price, we continue to gain scale as we grow, and all that's going to result in expansion of margin and increased profitability. Steve Wieczynski : That's helpful. And curious I wanted to dig into the customer mix a little bit. I think there was a comment in the slide deck about loyalty guests driving a good portion of occupancy, but curious how do you have seen new cruise bookings transition in the last 60 days and if there's been any catch-up there? Mark Kempa : Early in the pandemic recovery there was an overwhelming skew towards past guests booking. They were the most comfortable with cruising, most comfortable with particular brand. What we have seen really since the beginning of the year is a return to normal breakout between past guests booking with us, new to brand guest booking with us, and new to cruise bookings with us. So I think from that perspective, we've either reached or about to reach the normal break out of the different groups of passengers, which is good to see. Cruise lines can't live with the past guests alone. So it's good to see the return of new to cruise and new to brand to us. Steve Wieczynski : Great, thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Grambling : Hi, thanks. Outside of the start-up costs, is there any way you can frame the impact of COVID related costs this year to sustain, whether it's social distancing testing, et cetera, and what you would look for to start easing some of these maybe as we get out to 2023? Frank Del Rio : Yeah, Steve, I think outside of testing we've effectively stopped for social distancing with the reduced regulations that were issued by the CDC recently. We're now going to be taking back some cabins over time that we had to put aside for quarantine or for isolation so that produces additional opportunities. There's going to be certain staff areas that we can reduce. So I think as we cycle through the second quarter and probably somewhat into the third quarter, you're going to start to see some of those kinds of what we'll classify as pandemic-specific related costs go away. I don't foresee any major cost components going forward from 2023 onward as a result of the pandemic. Just some things on the margin, but nothing significant. Stephen Grambling : And then maybe to harp on your answer to the questions on record net yields. I think some of the skeptics have been concerned that this bullish outlook six months out has been kind of success successively always six months out each quarter for about a year. So I guess what do you feel has changed this quarter to give greater confidence in those trends finally materializing. Frank Del Rio : Well, the reason why the phenomena that you just described has occurred because we keep having these Black Swan events. First, it was Delta, than it was Omicron and then there was the Ukraine, Russian situation. And so we have tempered all our remarks by saying, as long as there are no additional Black Swan events we're seeing fantastic pricing strength. It is meaningful over what our record 2019 pricing was. And therefore again in the absence of anything new, this will hold. In the past that hasn't held because of these Black Swan events. So promise me no more Black Swan events Steve and I'll promise you record net yields. Mark Kempa : But let's balance that Steve with the fact that we did turn cash flow positive in March. We are confident we are going to be cash flow positive in the second quarter. It's been over 2.5 years as a company since we've been able to say that, and that's going to translate into EBITDA and then ultimately profitability. So the tide is turning and the future looks bright. So those are key milestones that we should not discount. I want to highlight that pretty strongly today. Stephen Grambling : On that point, have the closed in booking trends then flipped as well. It seems like it has from your commentary. I think, because that's what people are concerned by that you get to the close in and maybe there's just been some impact of people's willingness to get on cruises, get on the ships. So has that flipped where you'd say definitively, no, there has been no inherent damage to the consumers' behavior getting on the ships, so that close in looking at new to cruise? Frank Del Rio : Well, I think, I think we in our commentary, I talked about that and we are seeing close in demand, which is good. And it's close and demand that's showing that consumers have confidence, they are booking within the cancellation period. We had not seen that during the pandemic.  So we've been seeing that over the last few months, which is a good sign. We're still seeing strong demand for the longer term as well, but again that's a sign of confidence that consumers are willing to go and they're confident that the voyage is going to sail and there's proper protocols in place. So it's actually a very good sign in relation to where -- as we exit the pandemic. Stephen Grambling : Awesome. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning everyone. A question for you, with the CDC last week, lowering the requirement for vaccination to 95% and 90%, does that change at all, how you folks think about your requirement? And correct me if I'm wrong, I believe you're still at 100% vaccination requirement. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : No. Patrick, that's not correct. We have -- we had reduced from 100% to 95% when the CDC allowed it, and now we are at least for the Oceania -- at least our Norwegian brand, which is the family brand in our company, we're going to be allowing 90% of the folks to be vaccinated, 10% not. That opens up the family market in a big way, just in time for the summer season. Patrick Scholes : Okay, thank you for the clarification. That was all the question I had. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. A bunch of my questions have already been answered. I guess one thing, you were talking about the second half, the strength in bookings meaningfully ahead. I think you mentioned that still includes itineraries going to Asia. And just wondering how -- sort of based on how things are now if it continued and those markets didn't open up to cruising.  When would you make those changes? Just thinking about sort of when your bookings maybe sort of past the point of having any more disruptions for the year? How far in advance, anything Q4 going to Asia, would you make those changes? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Yeah. Asia is really bookings strong for us and it's very, very high prices. But there is that risk. Robin. And so we will likely take some chips off the board in the coming weeks to balance that risk reward, likely at the Norwegian brand, which has more flexibility in where it can achieve good pricing and accelerate the bookings, much faster than Oceania region can because of the longer booking curve there. The good news is that you don't just today we heard from the Minister of Tourism in New Zealand that they expect New Zealand to open up no later than October to cruising. That opens up that whole Australasia area for us, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti. And we hear good commentary coming out of some Asian countries, some Asian ports, not China. And we're not very big in China as you know. So we are hopeful but there is a risk there, no question. But we are hopeful that it will reopen. I know, South America, which also caused some issues this past winter looks like it's going to be open. Argentina has announced, Uruguay has announced, Chile has announced. So again, the world is reopening perhaps at different pace. But it is reopening. And that's good news for us. Robin Farley : Okay, that's great. Thank you. And maybe just a last follow-up, just going back to the close in booking question. I don't know if there's anything that you can share that you can kind of quantify with the close in, in another words like what percent of bookings are for departures in the next six weeks or anything like that. Just to see that, because it seems like that's the piece right that -- obviously that with the disruptions earlier this year, all the cruise lines have got lost a little bit of ground in terms of the recovery. And is there a way to quantify anything with a close in bookings, because that's sort of you -- as we head into the peak summer season, way to think about what strength may not be showing up in your numbers yet, but is there? Frank Del Rio : Robin, I'm not going to give you a number per se, but I will tell you that close in bookings, defined as bookings for the next 60 days are running significantly higher than history. Now part of that is because historically there typically is very little inventory to sell inside 60 days and that's not necessarily the case today. But it is strong, much stronger quite frankly than we anticipated two, three months ago and it's another positive green shoot as Mark mentioned, when we get momentum back and I'll take momentum anyway I get it, if that means bookings are strong for the next close in, that's a start. Just last week, the Oceania brand introduced late '23, all of 24 departures had one of its top three booking days in history.  So we're seeing people booking way into the future. And now we're seeing very, very strong bookings, very close in. And so in time, if there is a gap between the long and the relatively short. It's going to be start -- it's going to start to fill in. And again another green shoot, as the summer rolls around top prime cruising season, it's going to continue to get better. So again I preface it no more Black Swan events, the industry is going to progressively get stronger, better going back to normalcy, reaching the normal high occupancies that we've always enjoyed. Robin Farley : Okay, that's great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. . The next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dan Politzer : Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions. You guys have typically have higher pricing than peers and certainly that's the case today. I mean to what extent do you think that your pricing power right now is a reflection of maybe a skew to the higher end consumer and what have you seen kind of across your database and the different brands, in terms of booking and pricing strength? Frank Del Rio : I think we're seeing pricing strength. I know we're seeing pricing strength across all three brands. Certainly the upscale brands are doing terrific because of the nature of their itineraries or customer base. Their booking curve is always further out than the closer in Norwegian brand and that is certainly playing out again for the back half of '22, and into '23. I just mentioned, one of the upscale brands just announced '24 itineraries, and had a near record day, one of the top three days in the company's history. So we're not seeing any isolation of one brand versus another in terms of pricing. Pricing is strong across the board and that's very encouraging for us partly because all three of our brands have the same go-to-market strategy where we focus on marketing and the value proposition over pricing. It's not one brand does one thing and one another brand does another. We harmonize, add and curate it and that's why we have such a strong historical performance in year-over-year yield growth and have the highest yields in the industry by a very wide margin. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then in terms of just markets. I mean is it safe to assume it's your North American markets that are really driving that pricing power, or are you seeing any stabilization for outbound in Europe? Frank Del Rio : No, I think Europe has come back very, very nicely. I was just talking to one of our brand Presidents this morning and he tells me that European sourced business is strong and you can't believe how strong it is, especially in Europe. UK is doing well. Australia is still lagging a bit. That country as you know has been closed for a while. But again these are all green shoots. We're waking up to bear. Look, it's been 26 months since we were shut down on March 10. It took us 26 months to get our fleet back operating at full strength. And so it's going to take some time to get all the pieces right, to get consumers thinking in the right direction, getting the ports open around the world and it all starts with a moderation of COVID. And I think we've seen that even when there are spikes here and there. Society is learning to live with COVID and we have to do that. It's not going away. No vaccine is going to make it disappear.  It is now one of the many novel Coronaviruses that affect our lives every day and I'm glad to see that we're all learning to live with it. But learnings take a while. And so that's what we're seeing. We're seeing green shoots. We're not 100% back to where we need to be, but certainly we are approaching the levels we need to sail full, to generate highest net yields in the company's history. The highest EBITDA in the Company's history in the coming quarters. With that, we have time for one more question and then we'll conclude today's presentation. Operator : Thank you. That question will come from the line of James Hardiman with Citi. Sean Wagner : Hi, this is Sean Wagner on for James. Just kind of within that 28% total per diem growth versus 2019, is there any color you can give on the ticket NPDs and onboard spend in the quarter and sort of how they've trended sequentially, just may be on a kind of comparable ship basis as more ships have gotten under the water and ships are getting kind of closer to normal occupancy? Frank Del Rio : Yes, Sean. So look, we continue to see strength in both ticket and onboard revenue. As we've talked about in our last few calls, the strength of the consumer is resonating well on the ships. Obviously if you look at our financials and realize we do have our bundling strategy which sort of it somewhat artificially inflates our onboard revenue by a couple of percentage point, nothing major. So even if you isolate that out, the onboard revenue performance is just strong. But more importantly, it starts with the ticket.  It starts with getting that right customer that high quality customer booking far out in advance. Those are the customers we target. We get a -- we offer them a significant value, and that in turn they spend on board. So it's coming across in all areas. And that's what we're glad to see that. That's what we want to see. That's what we're targeting. That's what's behind our go-to-market strategy. So it's not just one or the other, it's a combined effort. Sean Wagner : Okay, that's very helpful. And just real quick, you mentioned in the slide deck, returning to historical load factors in 2023. Is there any specific time you expect to kind of get to maybe normalized historical occupancy levels? Frank Del Rio : I think it's going to be in early -- in the first half of 2023, like we said, we continue to build. Q2, we expect is going to be in the 65% range. Obviously when you look at the third and fourth quarter that's going to continue to build. But we're going to maintain our price discipline, our pricing integrity. We are not going to chase short term load and damage the brand for the long term, we do not believe that's not our strategy, and that is not the right strategy for our company. So we will maintain that price discipline. We expect over the first half of 2023, we're going to be back at those 105, 110 load factors that we're used to seeing, but more importantly at high pricing. Sean Wagner : Perfect, thank you very much guys. Jessica John : Before we go we'd like to remind everyone that our Annual General Meeting is coming up on June 16th. This year we have a number of very important proposals on the ballot. We are extremely appreciative of the support we received from our shareholders during this extraordinary time, and we are asking for our shareholder's continued support. On behalf of every shareholder account that votes we will make a $1 charitable donation to American Cancer Society, up to $100,000. Please vote and support our Board's recommendations for our Annual General Meeting proposals, so that we can continue to deliver on our mission to provide exceptional vacation experiences delivered by passionate team members committed to world class hospitality and innovation.  Thanks everyone for your time and support. As always, we will be available to answer your questions. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Business Update and Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darryl, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time.  As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, Darryl, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary. After which, Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the Company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Over the past several quarters, we have reached many pivotal milestones as we continue the steady march of our post-pandemic recovery. On our last call, we had just welcomed the last ship in our fleet back to service, becoming the first major cruise operator to be fully operational. This quarter, we are pleased to report that we have reached another key milestone with operating cash flow turning positive for the second quarter. While our focus is on our profitable future, when I take a moment to reflect on the tremendous progress we have made since launching our great cruise come back just over a year ago, I can't help but be immensely proud of the entire team in Norwegian for rising to the occasion time and again and delivering impressive results. Working well alongside us has been the travel agent community who more than anyone can appreciate the challenges that we as an industry have overcome, and more importantly, can also see the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We thank them for their unyielding support throughout this journey. We have been disciplined and methodical in our ramp-up and have maintained a clear and consistent mindset focused on our go-to-market strategy of market-to-fill and emphasizing value over price by continuing to expand and refine our bundling strategy. Our guiding principle has been a focus on the long-term profitability of the Company, particularly for 2023 and beyond, by protecting our long-term brand equity and building on our industry-leading pricing. This means making intentional tactical sacrifices in the short term in favor of long-term sustainable results. With this ethos at the forefront of our business plan, we also continue to be opportunistic, exploring all options to accelerate our recovery. As I serve in the current landscape, I see several tailwinds and catalysts for our company which are outlined on slide 4. First, since we last spoke, we have seen further improvement in the public health and regulatory environment, which has allowed us to relax COVID-related protocols and align us more to the rest of the hospitality industry. Last month, the CDC discontinued its voluntary COVID-19 program for cruise ships. This was a strong signal of confidence by the CDC that the industry's COVID-19 mitigation and management plans are robust and effective. This very positive development has paved the way for us to begin removing barriers for our guests. We're committed by local regulations, bringing us not quite an equal footing with land-based vacation and leisure alternatives, but significantly closer. Just yesterday, we announced a number of changes to our own health and safety protocols, which are effective September 3rd, and as always, are subject to local regulations. We will no longer have a mandatory vaccination requirement in any of our ships, and have relaxed testing protocols, regardless of sailing length. To put it simply, vaccinated individuals, including those embarking on NCLH ship from U.S. ports will no longer have any pre-cruise related protocols, and those who are unvaccinated or choose not to provide proof of vaccination will be required to test negative within 72 hours prior to embarkation. In addition, all guests 11 years old and younger will be exempt from vaccination and testing requirements of any kind. There remain a few jurisdictions with strict requirements, including Canada, Greece and Bermuda where we will continue to comply with local mandates. These modifications or protocols are meaningful and give us additional flexibility to reach a wider cruising population, reduce friction and travel-related hassles for our guests and bring greater variety to our itineraries. In fact, yesterday's announcement was an instant catalyst, resulting in one of our top three best booking days of the year. Our top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and communities we visit. And this commitment too is unwavering even as we are evolving our SailSAFE protocols to adapt to the changing public health environment. Across the globe, we continue to see the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of ports to cruise, bringing us closer to a normal operating environment. One significant example of this easing is the lifting in June of the onerous one-day testing requirement to enter the U.S. While the decision was too late to have a meaningful impact on ship sailing in a second, and to a lesser degree, third quarters of this year, the change resulted in an immediate and sustained boost in booking volumes for future periods in the weeks following the announcement. Second, and despite recession and economic slowdown fears abounding in the broad marketplace, we continue to see a strong upmarket consumer, with booking trends continuing to show steady improvement week-over-week, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. But at a high level, to evaluate the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel, we typically monitor two key indicators. First is the booking window, which provides a peek into the consumer psyche about the future, given that cruise is a long lead time and relatively high ticket purchase. To be clear, we have not seen any cracks emerge in the dynamics of the booking window. And it remains both within historical range and our own expectations. Second is our onboard revenue generation, which is a real-time now indicator of how our guests are feeling about their financial situation right now and while onboard our ships. Onboard revenue generation has continued to be impressive, even as we continue to ramp up occupancy carrying more guests across all ships and cabin classes. In the second quarter, onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was approximately 30% higher than during the comparable 2019 period. We continue to focus on enhancing our market-leading bundled offerings and increasing quality touch points with our guests starting from the time of booking to capture even more revenue pre-cruise, allowing guests to arrive on board with an ever fresher wallet, which ultimately results in higher overall spend. In fact, our pre-cruise revenue on a per passenger day basis for second quarter '22 is up over 50% versus 2019 levels. At a high level, guests who make pre-cruise purchases tend to spend approximately double that of guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. And while the broader economy has experienced a pullback in consumer spending for physical goods, we continue to see strong propensity for spending on travel and experiences, particularly from the affluent consumer. Hotel average daily rates and airline fares remain at or near record levels, with occupancies reaching pandemic peaks. Consumers want a vacation even during economic downturns. And we believe cruises are much better positioned than land-based alternatives to capture the strong demand given our unmatched value proposition. While consumer appetite for experiences bodes well for the entire cruise industry, we believe our company in particular is best positioned to outperform in this environment. Our three brands focus on providing upscale experiences relative to their respective industry categories, and therefore, skewed towards the higher-end consumer, which while not immune have proven more resilient than other cohorts in previous downturns. And all indications are that the intent to travel for this demographic has not abated. The last and arguably most exciting catalyst I want to touch on is our attractive pipeline of new builds, outlined on slide 5, which will greatly enhance our already world-class fleet and drive significant contributions to the top and bottom line. I just came back from Italy last week where we took delivery of Norwegian Prima, the first of six next-generation Norwegian Cruise Line ships, bringing our total fleet to 29 vessels with approximately 62,000 berths. We are excited to celebrate her christening ceremony later this month in Reykjavik, Iceland. And I encourage all of you to experience her firsthand as she is truly incredible. In fact, our shipbuilding partner, Fincantieri, have said Prima is the clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most demanding and most complex vessel they have ever built. The Prima class marks an evolution for Norwegian Cruise Line as every aspect of the design and guest experience has been elevated. Last week, we also celebrated the float out of Norwegian Viva, the second vessel in this groundbreaking new class, which is expected to debut in summer of 2023, as seen on slide 6. The Prima class will further differentiate Norwegian Cruise Line compared to our cruise peers and reinforce the positioning of our brands as the leaders in providing upscale experiences in each of the major cruise categories. In addition to the new Norwegian vessels, we are also gearing up for the delivery of Oceania Vista in spring of '23 and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur later that year. These new additions will further add to our dominance in the flourishing upper premium and luxury segments. I often get asked whether we are confident that we can profitably absorb the capacity growth we are expecting for the next few years. And the answer is a resounding yes. Given our relatively small base of only 29 ships, we still have many unserved and underserved markets around the world. We are continually innovating and enhancing our product offerings through our new builds and refurbishment upgrades to our existing fleet and making enhancements to our bundle offering to provide even more value and attract even more high-paying guests to our brands. I can't emphasize this enough. So, I will show you once again on slide 7 how we've proven our ability over the years to absorb capacity and deliver outsized revenue, adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow contributions relative to our capacity growth, and we fully expect to continue this trend. Turning now to our booking, demand and pricing trends summarized on slide 8. We continue to see sequential improvement as we remain disciplined and focused on laying the foundation for a record 2023 and beyond. In the second quarter, our load factor was approximately 65%, in line with our expectations and a significant improvement versus the prior quarter of 48%. We expect load factors to increase to the low 80% range in the third quarter, with July already coming in at 85%. This steady sequential ramp is expected to continue until we reach historical 100%-plus levels beginning for the second quarter of 2023. In terms of pricing, as you can see on slide 9, our net per diem growth in the first half of 2022 over the first half of 2019 pricing was significant at 18%. These results are consistent with our strategy of holding firm on our go-to-market strategy, outlined on slide 10, of market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill and maintaining pricing integrity by emphasizing high value over low price. We absolutely believe this is the optimal path to continually deliver high-quality and sustainable profitability once we return to a fully normalized environment post pandemic. As expected, our second half 2022 book position remains below an extraordinarily strong 2019, driven primarily by the lasting impacts of Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. That said, pricing for the second half of 2022 continues to be higher when compared to 2019, even when taking into consideration the dilutive effect of future cruise credits and the impact of premium priced Baltic itineraries from the Ukraine conflict, which is primarily concentrated in the third quarter. As we move beyond this transition year and focus on 2023, our full year book position is in line with 2019's record performance. And our booking pace in recent weeks has reached the level needed to consistently sail full. Pricing is also significantly higher for 2023. And while we typically would not provide this level of detail, our performance in this area is so extraordinary that I just had to share it with you this one time. Pricing for 2023 is currently running in excess of 20% -- 20% above 2019's record pricing and is higher by double digits across all three brands. And while pricing will naturally tend to level off as we continue to build our book for 2023, it is nevertheless a testament that our steadfast strategy of focusing on long-term price increases over short-term load factors is indeed working as intended. Another onetime proof point that I will provide is ticket sales already on the books for 2023 sailings. When compared to the same time in 2018 for 2019 sailings and taking into account capacity growth of approximately 20%, 2023 sales are a whopping 40% higher. In addition, the quality and stickiness of our ticket sales for '23 sailings is also expected to improve, as a significantly higher proportion of bookings, 4 times the level seen in 2019, include air travel booked through our own air programs, which in the past has proven to be indeed stickier. Another positive indicator demonstrating strong consumer demand is our advance ticket sales build. As you can see on slide 11, our advance ticket sales balance stood at $2.5 billion as of the end of the second quarter, up over $300 million versus the prior quarter, despite approximately $1 billion of revenue recognized. This represents an all-time record high ATS balance for the Company. On a gross basis, advance ticket sales build increased by over 40% to $1.5 billion in the quarter, the highest level in three years. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of the total ATS balance at quarter-end is associated with bookings that are already within the final payment window, and therefore, subject to cancellation penalties. The bottom line is that our entire team is more energized now than ever before. We are striving to reach our goal of record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA in 2023, welcoming 8 additional ships to our fleet through 2027 after Prima this year and leveraging all opportunities to maximize value for our stakeholders. This will not be an easy feat, especially as we continue to navigate an uncertain macroeconomic, but an increasingly encouraging public health and regulatory environment. We are prepared for all scenarios. And I'm confident that we are taking the right steps today to set us up for future success. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my commentary on our financial results and outlook, I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank our team of nearly 35,000 team members across the globe for their continued dedication, passion and commitment to excellence. Their collective efforts are propelling us forward as we continue to execute on our operational and financial recovery plan. We have made tremendous progress to date, which has led to the significant financial inflection point of generating positive operating cash flow in the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Turning to our second quarter results. During the quarter, we returned our full fleet back to service with the relaunch of Norwegian Spirit in early May. Our load factor for the quarter was 65%, in line with our prior guidance, which reflects our methodical approach to ramping up occupancy while maximizing pricing. Numerous sailings across key regions and markets achieved over 90% and 100% occupancy, with particular strength in recent months in the Caribbean and Bermuda markets. We continue to expect sequential quarterly increases in occupancies, with load factors returning to historical levels for the second quarter of 2023. Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter up approximately 20% versus 2019. As we look to the third quarter, we expect this metric to increase by high single digits compared to 2019 levels. This is impressive considering the impact in 2022 of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced European, in particular, Baltic, itineraries, which are heavily weighted to the third quarter. As a reminder, three ships were redeployed entirely as a result of the conflict, including one for each brand, and a total of 60 sailings across our fleet were canceled or modified. In addition, crew-related capacity constraints on the high yielding Pride of America are a further headwind to overcome. Turning to costs. Like every company across the globe, we continue to experience pressures from inflation and global supply chain constraints. Fuel prices remain a headwind, but our hedge program, as seen on slide 12, provides partial protection. And more recently, we have also seen prices beginning to moderate. We have opportunistically added to our hedge position during the quarter and are now approximately 40% hedged for the remainder of '22 and approximately 30% for 2023. We are also experiencing pressure on food costs, although we have recently seen green shoots of prices moderating for certain commodities, such as beef and pork. In addition, we are starting to see shipping and logistical costs moderating from their highs experienced in 2021 and early '22. Our supply chain and logistics teams continue to work around the clock to find measures to minimize this impact. Lastly, in the first half of 2022, we continued to incur additional costs associated with our COVID-19 health and safety protocols, primarily related to testing. As the industry continues to align its protocols with the broader travel and leisure space, we expect these costs to ramp down in the future. Taken together, we expect adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, to decrease approximately 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. Guided by our core market to fill strategy, we will continue to make disciplined demand-generating investments in marketing in the near term, with a focus on laying the foundation for a strong 2023. Looking ahead, while it is still too early to provide concrete guidance, we expect net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day in 2023 to exceed 2019 levels. Aside from the fact of three or four years of both normal and now hyperinflation, remember that we have the youngest fleet of the major operators. We have not disposed of any ships during the pandemic, and therefore, will not receive the unit cost benefit from the removal of less efficient capacity. To help with modeling, we have also provided additional guidance on key metrics, like capacity days, revenue expectations depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures, all of which can be found on slide 13. Shifting to our financial performance. Slide 14 lays out the key financial milestones already achieved as well as our expectations for the upcoming quarters. As previously stated, we generated approximately $260 million of operating cash flow for the second quarter after first turning positive for the month of March. Given that just over a year ago we were just beginning the herculean task of returning our ships to service after 500 days on the sidelines, this is no small accomplishment. The next milestone we are aiming to achieve is slightly positive adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2022, leading to positive adjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter. All of these stepping stones are consistent with our return to service plan and position us extremely well for 2023, where a return to a more normal operating environment, along with our focus on pricing discipline, is expected to lead to record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for the full year. Moving to liquidity and our balance sheet. Our overall liquidity position remains strong, totaling approximately $2.9 billion at quarter-end, which consisted of cash of approximately $1.9 billion and an undrawn $1 billion commitment. This existing $1 billion commitment, originally entered into in November 2021, was recently extended through March 2023. We have been clear that we view this facility as a backstop, and we currently do not intend to draw on it. However, given the volatility in the capital markets in recent months, we felt extending the facility was the prudent choice to enhance our financial flexibility. Based on our current projections and trajectory, we continue to believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs organically. Slide 15 demonstrates the result of the proactive and deliberate measures we undertook throughout the pandemic to optimize our debt maturity profile. We resumed debt amortization payments in April, which were previously deferred during the pandemic. For the remainder of 2022 and for full year 2023, we have approximately $500 million and $900 million of debt payments coming due, respectively. The vast majority of which is related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. While on the surface, 2024 maturities appear high, approximately $2.4 billion is related to our operating credit facility, consisting of our revolver and Term Loan A. Both of which we expect to refinance well prior to maturity. This positions us well as we continue to ramp up and return to a more normal operating environment. For additional detail on the breakdown of our upcoming debt payments through 2027, we also provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website. After taking delivery of Prima less than two weeks ago, with fixed rate financing that was secured back in 2017, our debt portfolio is approximately 75% fixed rate today. This fixed rate -- fixed ratio is expected to increase to approximately 80% by year-end 2023, with the addition of three new builds next year, positioning us well in a rising rate environment. The weighted average cost of debt for the portfolio is approximately 5%. We took out, as a reminder, all of the high-cost double-digit debt we incurred during the pandemic at an opportune time prior to the current dislocation we are seeing in the markets by completing balance sheet optimization transactions in November '21 and February 2022. Turning to slide 16. As I've said this before and will repeat it today, we believe the transformational growth we have in the pipeline over the next few years, representing 50% growth in capacity by 2027 as compared to 2019, is an underappreciated component of our company's investment thesis. Our new ships have very favorable and efficient financing structures, resulting in an expected and immediate boost to profitability. For all new builds on order, our financing is committed at fixed rates averaging approximately 2.5% over the portfolio. To help you better understand the mechanics of the cash inflows and outflows associated with the new ship, slide 17 lays out an illustrative scenario demonstrating the typical time line. In general, approximately 20% of the ships cost is due in four installments tied to various milestones preconstruction beginning at contract signing. Typically, 80% of the cost is then due upon taking delivery of the ship. However, while this looks like a large capital expenditure outlay in the financial statements, we also received very efficient export credit agency-backed financing at the same time. This ECA-backed financing covers approximately 80% of the ship cost, which, as I mentioned earlier, is committed prior to contract signing and at extremely attractive rates. In certain cases, we also structure predelivery financing in order to better max the timing of cash flows. Amortization payments on this deck began six months after delivery of each vessel and continue over 12 years. An often overlooked but incredibly important facet in the cash flow mechanics of a new build time line is that well prior to a delivery of a vessel, we are already receiving significant cash inflows in the form of advanced ticket sales and onboard presales. Given that final payments from our guests are typically due 120 days prior to a sailing, this is when the cash engine begins to come to life. As a rough estimate, we typically receive in the range of $100 million to $150 million of cash inflow from future bookings prior to a vessel's first revenue sailing, resulting in a cash infusion into the business that continues to build over time as final payments for future voyages also become due. So, while we often hear concerns surrounding the industry's capacity growth, we welcome and are excited for new capacity we have coming online. We have a high degree of visibility into the supply chain, supply pipeline for the industry, with only four major shipyards globally who can build cruise ships of scale. This, coupled with the incredibly efficient cost and financing structure of the new builds are a unique differentiator for us and the industry at large. So, in summary, I am pleased with the progress we have made so far, but more importantly, how we have positioned our company for the future. While there continue to be challenges facing our business and we are keeping a close eye on how the macroeconomic environment evolves, we also have significant tailwinds, including a continued post-pandemic return to normalcy and the industry-leading capacity growth that I just discussed, all of which bode well for our future prospects. With that, I'll turn it back over to Frank for closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. And before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which slide 18 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we published our second annual comprehensive ESG report and SASB aligned disclosure on World Oceans Day in June. The report highlights our progress and commitments on our top ESG priorities. As we strive to provide critical transparency to our stakeholders this year, we focused on expanding and improving the data disclosed in our report, including expanding Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions reporting, providing climate risk and resiliency data through our TCFD assessment, and strengthening human capital disclosure, including with data related to diversity as well as training and development. We also increased the scope of our third-party assurance to include many of these new data points. Earlier this year, we also announced that we are pursuing net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This ambition spans our entire operation and value chain as we aim to bring all of our key partners along with us on this important journey. As we have said previously, a key driver to achieve our net zero ambition is the development of alternative fuels along with the associated critical infrastructure at destinations globally to support the creation, distribution, storage and usage of these fuels. Methanol is one of the fuels we are actively exploring. And we recently joined the Methanol Institute to collaborate, share and adapt solutions alongside the institute's members of methanol producers, distributors and technology providers. We will continue to evaluate a variety of alternative fuels and share learnings with other companies as we collectively try to find a viable long-term solution. And before I turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways that you can find on slide 19. First, we continue to execute on our return-to-service plan and are achieving key milestones as a return-to-normalcy. The improving public health and regulatory environment, including our recent relaxation of testing and vaccination protocols, are a tailwind. And our entire team is focused on setting the stage for long-term sustainable profitability in '23 and beyond. Second, we are seeing a strong consumer with a healthy desire to spend on travel and experiences, particularly in the upscale demographics our brands target. This strength is demonstrated by our improving booking trends, robust pricing and strong onboard revenue generation. Lastly, we are excited for the transformational and highly profitable growth we have in store over the next five years as we welcome eight additional ships to our fleet after Norwegian Prima. We've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions. Operator? Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Dan Politzer : So, you guys certainly had some positive commentary on 2023. I think, Frank, you gave the first time -- the sales are pacing 40% higher than this time historically. I'm just trying to bridge to 2023 EBITDA, which you said is going to be a record. Does that assume pricing is going to continue to accelerate, or is that more of a function of cruise costs moderating from that second half pace which you guys have set? Frank Del Rio : Hi, Dan and welcome to the cruise industry. Look, I think it's everything. I think we're going to see occupancies return to normal levels. We expect that to begin certainly by second quarter of '23. We expect pricing to be higher in '23 than 2019. We have more capacity, more high price capacity. Remember, in 2019, we took delivery of Encore literally in the last few weeks of the year. We had no contribution from the Regent Splendor, which was delivered in February of 2020. Both of those vessels will have a full year in '23. We'll have a full year of Prima. We'll have roughly 7 months of Vista, 6 months or so of Viva and a little bit of Grandeur towards the end. So, we've got new ship deliveries that are extraordinary, high-priced. We have -- as of today and trending better every day. I really think that our announcement yesterday of relaxing protocols is really going to be a tailwind. We saw it instantly yesterday, and it accelerated throughout the day. Today is also gangbusters compared to a typical Tuesday. The last thing we have control over is overall inflation. But if you believe the experts, and we are seeing, as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, some green shoots, where costs are already coming down, including fuel, including food costs, that's strong. And so today, we sit here telling you that we have record load, record pricing, record capacity days that we're absorbing very easily. And therefore, we strongly believe that we will have a record net yield in '23, which results in record EBITDA. Mark Kempa : And Dan, just to highlight, further to what Frank's saying, it's not only the top line growth and the profitability of the new ships we have coming on line. We are focused on costs. Obviously, 2022 has been a very lumpy year. It will continue to be a bit lumpy for the second half given where our load factors are expected to be. You have to remember that a lot of our costs are fixed in nature. So when you look at it on a unit basis, yes, they are a little bit higher in the second half in -- for 2022. But again, we expect normalization of that as we go into 2023. And we've stated very clearly, we are spending dollars on demand-generating initiatives, i.e., marketing, building a very strong 2023 book across the board. So we're making the investment today. We're not chasing the incremental load factor for next quarter. We are focused on a very profitable, high-yielding, lower cost 2023, which we believe will result in a record EBITDA year next year. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then, just for my follow-up. For the third quarter, I know you guys have talked about pricing tracking up high single digits. Any additional color, or if you could unpack that, just given, obviously, Europe, I would assume is a headwind this year. So to the extent you've seen strength in other regions, just kind of a lay of the land would be helpful. Frank Del Rio : Yes. Look, Alaska is very, very strong. Our Caribbean product is also selling well. We took a large vessel out of the Baltic very last minute reposition to Port Everglades, which she's doing very, very well. Bermuda is doing great. Europe isn't doing all that back considering what's going on over there with the Ukraine conflict. We are leaning more on European stores business, which typically underperforms in terms of both ticket price and onboard revenue. And still, overall, our yields are better in Q3. So, I think we're going through, like Mark mentioned, some lumpiness. We've had protocol situations that are improving. The elimination of the testing requirement to get back into the country was huge. Americans simply didn't want to take the chance to be stuck in Europe should they contact COVID. That's had an impact over the short, medium term. Remember, one of the wonderful things about the cruise industry is you have great visibility because of the booking curve, people book way in advance. So, when these things occur, it impact the short term, which is why we simply don't want to chase short-term occupancy at the expense of long-term pricing. Pricing has a long tail. The occupancy, the load factor of any given sailing, once it's -- that sailing is finished, it's finished. It has no impact on the long run or no cumulative impact. But pricing does. So for us, it's incredibly important, especially since we target that high-quality, high-paying consumer to maintain pricing discipline, as you can see, across the board to be up in pricing, 20% for 2023 is truly extraordinary. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : So maybe just on the back of that, and apologies for the -- to the near-term question. I feel like I'm splitting hairs a little bit here. But when I look in your deck now versus last quarter, it looks like the back half in terms of when you sort of were looking for positive adjusted EBITDA may have down shifted a little bit. And I think maybe you just covered it, Frank, in talking about not giving up occupancy for price. But I want to know if there was anything else in there that you just weren't really expecting three months ago that maybe impacted that. . Frank Del Rio : No, I don't think so. It's just the cumulative sustained lasting issues on -- related around Omicron, it's only been in the last weeks that, number one. The Biden Administration took down the requirement to test negative to get back into the U.S., number one. Number two, the CDC dropping the cruise guidelines, which occurred about three weeks ago, and just yesterday, us announcing the relaxation of our own protocols. I think those three items, each one of them had a positive impact on bookings. And as we said in our prepared remarks, each one of those events triggered an improvement in booking volumes. But remember, booking -- the booking curve on average is about seven months out. So when you say that all this happened around midyear, whether it was late June, mid-July, now early August and you look seven months into the future, that's where you get, you get to 2023. We could, we could like others, chase short-term occupancy and sell cruises for crazy prices, but we don't want to do that. We never have done that. That is not our strategy. I remind you what happened back in '08 and '09, when -- the great recession, certain cruise companies did drop their prices to ridiculous levels. And it took them, in some cases, 10-plus years, and in some cases, they've not yet reached those pre great recession yields. I'm not willing to mortgage the company for 10-plus years in order to window dress the next quarter or so. I just won't do it. We're here for the long term. We're managing the business on a long-term basis. COVID had a major impact. We were shut down for 18 months or so, and the recovery is not instant mashed potatoes. If you want instant mashed potatoes, you got to go elsewhere because we're here for the long run. And our pricing strategy, how disciplined it is, is proof of that. To be -- to have 40% more ticket sales on the books right now compared to 2018 despite a 20% increase in capacity is formidable. And I've been doing this for 30 years. I've managed cruise companies in good times and in bad times, and I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that you don't sacrifice the long-term pricing power of your brand in order to achieve short-term load factor gains. Brandt Montour : Thanks for that, Frank. We don't like instant mashed potatoes either. And maybe just a quick modeling question on -- from -- in terms of gross revenue, you gave us a little bit of guidance for the 3Q. And I was just curious if you could just walk us through that to sort of net revenue per PCD. And the only reason I bring that up is because it looks like the commission and transportation line in the 2Q was a little bit elevated. I don't know if that was a higher flight costs that you guys are passing through or whatnot. But maybe you can unpack that a little bit for us. Mark Kempa : Yes. Hi Brandt. Good morning. It's Mark. So yes, when you compare our gross in Q2 versus Q1, you will see -- gross to net, you will see a slightly elevated cost structure. And that's going to be representative of more of the ongoing cost structure. I think Q1, given all the dynamics where we had many sailings, many cancellations, we had quite a bit of ancillary revenue coming through in the gross line, which may have bumped up the next, so to speak. But as we stated in our prepared remarks, we have now embarked on our air program that we've been working on for many years. So, you are starting to see the costs of that come through. And so, I think you're going to see these more -- these are going to be the more norm level, so to speak. But it's coming through in both the gross. And obviously, when you look at the net, and again, considering the fact that in Q3, we were heavily weighted, particularly in Europe, and we're still having very strong pricing, I think it's a pretty impressive result. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : So, one of the questions we've gotten a bunch this morning, and Frank, you've already talked a little bit about this, but it's the change in the '23 book position today versus kind of where you were back in May. And obviously, pricing has actually improved a good bit, but the level of bookings have potentially slowed a bit. And I would assume this is all going to stem from your go-to-market strategy, which you've already discussed a lot. So, I guess, the question here is, should we expect moving forward that pricing should continue to basically push north, but we, us, investors have to be prepared that the book position could get moved around more than what we've been accustomed to in the past? And then, the second part of this question also, if you guys could -- I don't know if you will give this or not, but give us a sense of where you think you'll turn the calendar year in terms of being booked for '23 versus where you would be historically. Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Steve, there was a lot there in your question, so I'll try to remember it all and remind me if I miss something. You can't be ahead significantly forever, because at some point, the time lines converge. So, we're very, very pleased where we are today for 2023 in terms of cumulative book position. As the calendar goes forward and we get closer to '23, I would expect us to stay more or less where we are today. Because if you recall, back in 2018, I think it was this very call in early August, where I said we had now reached the optimal balance between advanced bookings and pricing. If you book too fast, you leave money on the table. If you book too slow, you'll pay the price later by having to discount to fill, and we don't want to go there. So, we're very happy with the pace that we're at. We don't want to accelerate it much more than we have. We're instead focusing on price. We think that the tailwinds that I described so far this morning is going to help. But we don't want to be ahead any more than we are today because we had reached that point in '18 where we thought we were optimum, and we want to maintain it. It all had to do with the booking curve and different itineraries. So, I'm pleased where we are today. Not looking to push load factors, to accelerate load factors, although, again, I do believe that two or three tailwinds that we discussed this morning are going to have a natural tailwind to bookings. Did I miss one of your questions, Steve? Steve Wieczynski : No. That pretty much covers it all, Frank. And then the second question actually is going to be probably for Mark here, and it's going to be a liquidity question, which I'm sure you're tired of talking about. But Mark, I fully understand your comments you made in your prepared remarks, that we've seen some -- but at this point, we've seen some of your competitors say their liquidity profile was fine. And the next thing you know, we turn around and see them raise equity or do some kind of debt deal. So, I just -- I want to be clear here that -- and I know we can never say that -- that we shouldn't expect any type of dilutive raise over the near term given I think you said your cash flows at this point should be able to take care of pretty much all your near-term maturities. Mark Kempa : Hi, Steve. Yes. So look, based on everything we see today, and I'll repeat it again, we believe we can meet all of our liquidity needs organically. What you've seen from some of the competitors and more recently was really around refinancings of more near-term maturities. And specifically, what I called out in my prepared remarks is that was something we were focused on over the course of the pandemic. So, as you look at our maturity power and if you put aside the -- our normal operating facilities, our revolver and our term loan A, which we plan to amend and extend by the end of this year, we have a very clean path during our recovery. So, with that, we still have debt capacity should we need to go to the markets. We have no plans on raising liquidity via equity. We've said that before. We've diluted our shareholders enough through this pandemic. So, we feel good where we are, and we'll continue to watch that. But more importantly, we have a relatively clean path going forward. So, we feel good today. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist. Patrick Scholes : With your pricing strategy, and I completely understand the rationale for that, but I wonder how much does the current staffing market play into perhaps giving up some occupancy but holding pricing. And I relate this to some news that just came out with Diamond Princess canceling some itineraries due to not enough staffing. So again, how much does possible issues with staffing play into the strategy? And also maybe just some -- if you could give us just an update on the general staffing environment for you folks? Frank Del Rio : Yes. Patrick, this is Frank. Look, the internationally sourced crew that make up the abundance of our staffing on board, it's pretty back to normal. Quite frankly, I was surprised to see what you mentioned happen to another company. But we're not immune to it. We have challenges in that area that -- but it's not keeping us from filling the vessels, except for one, and that's Pride of America, which as you know is the only American flag vessel that requires us to have 75% of our crew to be American citizens. And we are having issues sourcing labor and crew for that vessel. And that vessel, which unfortunately is also our highest yielding vessel with the Norwegian brand, we've purposely kept the load factor since she's returned to service at 40%. So, would our overall load factors be higher in Q3 and Q4? Yes. And pricing would be higher. But we're purposely keeping it at that lower level because of labor shortages. We believe we have a road which, by year-end, we should see that vessel return to full occupancy. Certainly, the demand is there. It's disheartening every time we have to go and cancel and -- people who are booked and expect to go, and we have to keep that load factor in the 40% range. But that's around the edges. And like I said, we expect to be back at 100% occupancy on that vessel by year-end. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : I wanted to come at the cost perspective from maybe a different angle. Obviously, a lot of puts and takes here, with restart costs, maybe some pull forward of marketing, and you have elevated fuel prices to deal with as well. You go back pre-COVID, the business was pretty well dialed in, with EBITDA margins in the low-30s. And as you're thinking about the business longer term and planning for years ahead, and maybe you just assume that fuel prices at some point get back to what I'll call more normal range, is there any reason to think that margins don't get back to the neighborhood that they were before? I guess, another way of asking it is, has something changed in the relationship between operating costs and the pricing that you're seeing out in the market today? Mark Kempa : Good morning, Vince. So, the short answer to your question is no. While we are seeing some near-term headwinds with the cost pressures like every other business is seeing, longer term, we still believe that we have a very strong operating leverage. And the simplest example of that is it's almost a 2 for 1 relationship. Every point of yield is generally 2 times the point of cost in terms of monetary value. So, we still believe that to be intact as we look out into 2023. Obviously, it's very early to give any sort of concrete guidance around that. But apart from taking -- when we look at 2022, and internally, we try to normalize what the cost structure is, you have to remember that we have the full burden of cost today, yet we don't have the full complement of passengers on board. We're doing that purposely. So when you look at the metrics, like I said earlier, it's lumpy. But, as you look into '23 and then beyond, that operating leverage is fully intact, setting aside fuel, which we think we've mitigated reasonably with our hedge program. But we think there's a very, very real near-term path to getting back to historical margins. We just have to be able to operate consistently, operate our vessels at historical load factors, which we said we expect to be doing for second quarter of 2023. And I think you're going to start to see the normalcy appear very quickly. Vince Ciepiel : That's really helpful. And maybe separately, on the bookings commentary, it sounded really encouraging with sequential improvement, a record day yesterday, a strong morning, and just thinking about the occupancy guide for the third quarter. And I guess less short-term focus, but maybe more of an update on where the booking curve is at. Can you help us understand where close-in bookings are versus where they are historically and where the booking curve is at from a length perspective? Frank Del Rio : There's a lot there as well, Vince. Look, historically, the booking curve at the age level, knowing that each brand has a slightly different nuances, it's about 7 months. And today, it's slightly more elongated than that, I would say, closer to 9 months, primarily because of our focus on 2023 bookings versus 2022. If you gave me a choice of selling a cabin or a booking for a '22 departure versus a '23 departure, I'll take a '23 departure. So, our marketing is all geared towards 2023. We'll take '22 bookings, of course. But we're not pushing it. And certainly, we're not discounting to attract that kind of business. We believe investors are focused on '23 and beyond and not necessarily '22. So for us, '22 is a transition year. We're very pleased that we got the entire fleet operating. We're very pleased we took delivery of Prima. We're very pleased that we've now turned cash positive. But in terms of pedal to the metal focus, getting back to normal on margin, on yields, on EBITDA, on profitability, it's all about 2023 and beyond. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Most of my questions have been addressed already. Just one on -- so much of your maturities in the next 18 months look like they're ECA-related. And I wonder if you could talk about the potential there for those to be extended or pushed back in some way without you having to go to the capital markets and borrow for that. Thanks. Mark Kempa : Look, our ECA and all of our lenders have been phenomenal over the pandemic and really have been really flexible. But they too are commercial organizations, right? So, while we're going to work -- continue to work closely with them, first and foremost, as I've said, we believe that we can meet all of our needs -- liquidity needs organically. We have 20% more capacity coming on line next year, which is driving significant growth. But -- and so as we'll look -- as we look forward, if there are any near-term significant headwinds, we're going to look at all the options that are available out there. I would not want to point specifically to the ECAs or any other lender, but we're going to look at all options. And as we've seen in the past, I think there's a strong tailwind, so to speak, to make sure that the industry is thriving. So -- but more importantly, we don't think we need to do that. We don't think the industry needs to do that. And the industry is recovering. Let's keep in mind where we were this time last year. We were just starting to operate. And a year later, over the course of time, we are now turning positive cash flow. We're generating positive EBITDA. So, the machine has started and the flywheel is going. We just have to let it keep percolating, so to speak. So, we feel good. But look, we're going to look at all options, should the need ever arise. Robin Farley : Okay. No. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one clarification as a follow-up. You talked about onboard revenue being 30% higher, I think, it was compared to Q2 '19, which is a remarkable increase. Can you talk about how that's bundling? Do you have a higher percent of bundling in than you did in Q2, or kind of what adjustment is in there for the fact that -- some of that, I guess, is like in ticket price that you kind of allocate to onboard revenue for accounting purposes versus -- or is that 30% increase just purely what is spent once people get on board? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Well, it's certainly generating from what we're seeing on today's consumer, what they're spending on board. I will remind everybody on the call that we have been bundling now probably since late 2016, 2017. We started that in the industry. So, our numbers on a comparable basis are relatively clean. There's always some nuances between the two buckets. But we are not having any sort of any apples and oranges comparison in our '22 versus 2019 results. So, we raised -- as we've said, we've raised prices. In terms of all of our offerings on board, consumers are spending. We've gotten smarter in the pre-marketing of our products, creating that sense of urgency before the consumer steps on board. We talked about the consumer who -- those consumers who have a stronger propensity for presales, they also spend more, about 30% or 40% more once they're on board. So, it's a combination of all those. But the numbers are strong. We're seeing a strong consumer today, spending today's dollars. And we feel that bodes well for ourselves and the industry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Jaime Katz : I guess, my question primarily is around sourcing strategy and maybe how you guys have altered that given the weakness that we've been hearing in European consumers and how you're using that as a competitive advantage. And then just any details you have on marketing plans ahead of the wave season given the strong demand that you're seeing? Thanks. Frank Del Rio : Yes. We're not going to share with you our marketing plans for wave. I do believe that this coming Q1 will be the first true wave since 2020, which was cut short by the beginning of the pandemic. In terms of sourcing, look, we prefer an American consumer onboard all our vessels regardless of where the itinerary is operating. Americans book earlier, book a higher cabin category, and as Mark mentioned, spend more money on board. And that is still our basic go-to-market strategy. But for European sailings, partly because of the hesitancy by many Americans to travel to Europe until the mandate to test negative to come back to the U.S. is lifted, we leaned a little heavier on our European sourcing. Our European sales and marketing team did a fantastic job of accelerating demand from European marketplaces. But pricing suffered a bit. And in spite of that overall pricing suffering a bit, we still posted higher pricing in Q2, expect higher pricing in Q3 going forward. So, I think overall, the European consumer has improved a bit or we've done a better job of sourcing those high-quality consumers out of Europe like we do in the States. But make no mistake, we rely on the American consumer perhaps more so than others, because at the end of the day, we think they're the most resilient, certainly the wealthiest, understand our product best, and we'll continue to do that. Jaime Katz : Thank you. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. Frank Del Rio : Okay. Well, as always, thank you so much for your time this morning and for your support. The entire team here at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings will be available today to answer any of your questions. Have a great day, and stay safe, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You can now disconnect your lines. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Business Update and Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maria, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President, Investor Relations of ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltdcom/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release, the third quarter 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our IR website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we reached another significant achievement on our road to recovery this quarter, with a generation of positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time since the pandemic began. We have been clear about our intentional and methodical return to service strategy, consistently meeting or even exceeding the operational and financial milestones we have guided to. I am encouraged by our progress as each quarter has seen substantial sequential improvement in load factor with the shortfall gap continuing to narrow versus pre-pandemic levels, while our industry-leading pricing continues to hold strong. And while we are always looking for ways to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our recovery, I want to reiterate that our primary focus continues to be maximizing profitability for 2023 and beyond in a sustainable banner by prioritizing our long-term brand equity and protecting our industry-leading pricing. While the macroeconomic environment heading into 2023 remains more uncertain than usual, we see several tailwinds and catalysts to sustain our current positive trajectory as outlined on Slide 5. First, the public health regulatory COVID-related protocols continue to improve. In the past 30 to 45 days alone, key countries like Canada, Bermuda, Greece and all of South America have removed COVID testing requirements for entry and many countries in Asia have begun reopening the cruise. These developments have paved the way for us to relax our own COVID-19 protocols, allowing us to reach a wider cruising population as well as adding greater variety to high-yielding itineraries as more ports around the world become accessible to cruising. With the public health environment improving, in September, our 3 brands removed mandatory vaccination requirements. And just last month, Norwegian Cruise Line took another significant step forward with the elimination of all COVID-19-related guest protocols. That means no more vaccination, testing or masking requirements on any of the lines 18 ships, except in the very few areas around the world would still have specific COVID rules.  This is a long-awaited alignment of protocols to the rest of the travel lesion hospitality industries, which reduces friction, eliminates the #1 reason for not booking a cruise and meaningfully enhances the cruise experience for our guests. Our sales safe program was always designed to evolve and the improvement in the public health environment along with the near elimination of intrusive protocols to remain in place allow us to uphold our #1 priority of protecting the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and the communities we visit. Second, while there are heightened concerns surrounding an economic slowdown in the broader marketplace, the primary target cohort of our 3 brands, which is more upmarket and affluent than that of the cruise industry as a whole continues to demonstrate its willingness to spend on travel and experiences. In fact, you may have heard commentary from credit card issuers this earnings season about continued strong spend on travel and experiences, especially by those in higher-income categories, reinforcing the continued strength and resilience of demand for cruising, particularly among Americans.  Within the cruise industry, we believe our company is well positioned to outperform if indeed the macroeconomic environment weakens. First, and as Slide 6 illustrates our dominance in the upscale space, which we participate not only through our ocean and region brands, but also with our exclusive high-end ship-within-a-ship concept on Norwegian with the Haven is significant. And while this cohort is not totally immune to economic downturns, it has been very resilient historically. In addition, Slide 6 also demonstrates our favorable guest demographic mix which skews towards the higher end of the income spectrum as each of our brands operate at the top of their respective industry categories. The vast majority of our guests have a net worth of 250,000 plus. Again, a more resilient cohort in the event of an economic downturn particularly if the job market remains strong and the equity markets stabilize. With over 85% of our guest sourcing coming from North America, we will also benefit in the near term given our relatively low exposure to European sourcing, where the economic environment is already challenged. Long term, this bodes well for our business as North Americans have historically been the guests who booked the earliest, garner the highest ticket price and spend the most on board. Taken together, these factors contribute to our strong book position despite current microeconomic worries and a turbulent geopolitical environment. Last quarter, we spoke about the 2 indicators in our business that we typically monitor to evaluate the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel. The first being the booking window, which provides a peak into the consumer's psyche about the future; and the second being our onboard revenue generation, which is our best real-time now indicator. Both of these indicators continue to meet or exceed our expectations. In fact, our onboard revenue generation continues to break records as onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. In addition, our booking window in the third quarter was approximately 245 days, nearly 10% ahead of the same quarter in 2019. This is important because an elongated booking window is preferable as it provides better visibility, which allows us to increase prices sooner while moderating marketing expense. The last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading new build pipeline outlined on Slide 7, which we expect will enhance our brand\u2019s profile and product offerings and most importantly, drive significant revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 8. In August, we celebrated the christening of our newest ship, Norwegian Prima in Reykjavik, Iceland, the first major cruise ship christening in this historic seafaring locale. Prima has been incredibly well received with extremely positive feedback from the guests, travel partners, media and the investment community who have participated in the ship sailings so far. The addition of Prima in her upcoming 5 sister ships, along with Oceania Cruises\u2019 new generation Vista Class Ships and Regent Seven Seas Splendor will without a doubt, reinforce the positioning of our brands as the leaders in providing upscale experiences in each of the major cruise categories. Looking ahead to 2023, we have 3 new builds, 1 for each brand entering the fleet with over 5,000 additional births. These new ships are expected to attract new-to-brand guests, create excitement for our loyal pass guests and contribute significantly to top and bottom line financial results. With the relatively small size of our current 29 ship fleet, we are confident that we can absorb this capacity growth. Not only do we have many unserved and underserved markets around the world, but we also continue to believe that the cruise industry at large is vastly underpenetrated, especially when measured against other land-based vacation alternatives. To put this point into perspective, as you can see on Slide 9, which we provided at our investor event last month, the total number of state rooms aboard our 29 ships across our 3 brands is less than 1/4 the total number of hotel rooms in Orlando, Florida alone, just 1 city and 1 single country. And even if you look at the entire cruise industry, there are fewer state rooms in the global cruise fleet of over 250 ships than there are hotel rooms in the top 3 U.S. cities for hotel capacity, which is Orlando, Las Vegas and Chicago. So the opportunity to grow demand is significant. And when you couple that with the supply side of the equation where we have a high degree of visibility and a limited pipeline of new ships due to shipyard constraints, the industry and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in particular, have a strong foundation for continued growth. Shifting our discussions now to our bookings, demand and pricing trends. As you can see on Slide 10, in the third quarter, our load factor was approximately 82%, in line with our guidance and demonstrating continued and substantial improvement over the prior quarter of 65%. We expect load factors to continue improving sequentially to the mid- to high 80% range in the fourth quarter, despite the fourth quarter historically being a seasonally lower occupancy quarter than the third quarter. And looking at our quarterly load factor in terms of the gap with 2019, third quarter occupancy was approximately 30% below the comparable 2019 period and we expect continued sequential improvement in closing this gap to about 20% during the fourth quarter. The steady occupancy ramp-up is expected to continue until we reach historical 100% plus levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023. In terms of pricing, as you can see on Slide 11, our net per diem price growth in the third quarter of when compared to the third quarter of 2019 was up approximately 5%. This is particularly impressive when considering the hit pricing took with the absence of premium-priced Baltic itineraries in the quarter due to the Russia Ukraine conflict. These strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of holding firm on our core to go market strategy of market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill and maintaining price integrity by emphasizing high-value over low price, which you can see on Slide 12. I've said this before, and I will reiterate again today, given its high importance that we strongly believe that this strategy is the optimal path to continually deliver high-quality and sustainable profitability once we return to a fully normalized post-pandemic environment, which again, we expect will be in the early second quarter of 2023. Turning to Slide 13. As expected, our fourth quarter 2022 booked position remains below that of 2019. That said, pricing continues to be significantly higher when compared to 2019 even when taking into consideration the dilutive effect of future cruise credit. Dilution from future cruise credits will not carry forward into 2023 as the bonus or value-add portion of certificates issued during the pandemic will expire at year-end.  Focusing in on 2023, our full year book position is equal to 2019's record performance and our ongoing net booking pace is at the level needed to sail full beginning in the second quarter of 2023. We believe our cumulative book position is at the optimal level when balancing our desire to encourage guests to book early in order to be approximately 65% booked by year-end for the following year, while also maximizing our industry-leading pricing so as not to leave yield on the table.  This volume versus price dynamic is a delicate balance that we have fine-tuned over the years using historical itinerary specific data and our sophisticated revenue management system and is key to our success. Pricing is also significantly higher for 2023 versus the comparable 2019 period with strength seen across all 3 brands. As we have said previously, pricing naturally will level off as we fill out our book for 2023, but we continue to expect to achieve record pricing for full year 2023. As we look to the future, our entire team is mobilized, energized and ready to flawlessly execute, our eyes are wide open, and we are preparing for multiple scenarios given the current height uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and we are ready to adapt and pivot if needed. Our company and our industry has demonstrated its resilience time and again in the past. And I'm confident that if necessary, we will do so again. We are also encouraged by the relaxation of protocols in the regulatory and public health environment, which paved the way for us to return to normal operations, and we are excited to welcome the 8 additional ships to our fleet we have on order through 2027. We will continue to be disciplined and strategic as we work to set our company up for long-term success and to maximize value for all stakeholders. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our third quarter financial results and outlook and the progress we continue to make on our path to full recovery. Slide 14 outlines key metrics highlighting our third quarter results, all of which were at or above our previous guidance. During the quarter, our load factor improved 17 points over the prior quarter to 82%, in line with the guidance previously provided. This is consistent with our phased and methodical approach to ramping up occupancies while maintaining pricing discipline as we remain on track to reach historical load factor levels for the second quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter load factor is expected to be in the mid- to high 80% range, which, while on the surface appears only modestly higher than third quarter represents continued significant improvement when taking into account the seasonality of our operations. Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, up approximately 14% versus 2019 better than our expectation for a high single-digit increase. This is particularly impressive given the impact in 2022 of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced Baltic itineraries, which are heavily weighted to this quarter. In addition, crew-related capacity constraints on the high-yielding Pride of America were another headwind during the quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect this metric to increase by approximately 20% compared to 2019 levels. Slide 15 illustrates our advanced ticket sales build, which continues to indicate healthy consumer demand. Our total ATS balance stood at $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, flat versus the prior quarter's record high balance and versus the seasonal decline we typically see between the second and third quarter. On a gross basis, ATS build was $1.5 billion, consistent with the prior quarter, which was the highest level in 3 years. In addition, approximately $1.6 billion of the total ATF balance at quarter end is associated with bookings that are already within the final payment window and therefore, subject to cancellation penalties, which, by definition, results in stickier bookings and lower risk of churn. Turning to costs. We continue to feel the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints, which is pressuring margins in the near term. As seen on Slide 16, we have opportunistically added to our fuel hedge position during the quarter and are now approximately 44% hedged for the remainder of '22 and approximately 38% hedged for 2023. We continue to expect adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day to decrease approximately 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. Given our ongoing ramp up, second half costs are not representative of a go-forward run rate, in part due to the additional demand-generating marketing investments as we lay the foundation for 2023 which we expect will normalize closer to historical levels on a capacity adjusted basis beginning next year.In addition, we are starting to see some moderation of the hyperinflation we have seen in areas of late -- in areas such as food costs and related. Looking ahead to 2023, net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity, they will exceed 2019 levels as anticipated due to both normal and hyperinflation over the past 3 to 4 years. However, we are laser-focused on managing our cost base and our entire team is focused on mitigating this impact by increasing efficiencies and rightsizing the business all while still preserving the exceptional guest experience our brands are known for. To help with modeling, we have also provided additional guidance on key metrics like capacity days, revenue expectations, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures, all of which can be found on Slide 17 and in our earnings release. Shifting to our financial performance. Slide 18 demonstrates our continued momentum and consistency in achieving key milestones. Last quarter, we generated operating cash flow for the first full quarter since the beginning of the pandemic. And this quarter, we are pleased to report positive adjusted EBITDA of approximately $28 million. The next step forward is our expectation to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter. We have been clear throughout our return to service that this will not be an overnight lift the switch process, particularly given our intense focus on best positioning our company to maximize profitability once we return to a fully normalized operating environment. On our current trajectory, each of these building blocks are expected to lead to record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023. Moving to liquidity and our balance sheet on Slide 19. Our overall liquidity position remains strong totaling approximately $2.2 billion at quarter end, consisting of cash of approximately $1.2 billion and the undrawn $1 billion commitment. Keep in mind that during the third quarter, we took delivery of Norwegian Prima, which resulted in a cash outlay, partially offset by incremental ECA ship financing. Based on our current projections, and trajectory, we continue to believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs organically. Slide 20 demonstrates the result of our deliberate measures throughout the pandemic to optimize our debt maturity profile, which positions us well as we ramp up to a normal operating environment. For the remainder of 2022 and for the full year '23, we have approximately $300 million and $1 billion of debt payments coming due, respectively. The vast majority of which are related to our low-cost export credit agency-backed ship financing. We have previously disclosed that we are in the process of extending our operating credit facility, consisting of our revolver and term loan A which mature in early 2024, and we are on track to complete this by year-end. Upon completion, we expect to have a relatively smooth maturity profile over the course of the next few years. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments through 2027, we provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website. Our total debt portfolio is approximately 75% fixed rate today. And this is expected to increase to approximately 80% by year-end 2023, with the addition of 3 new builds next year, which positions us well in a rising rate environment. Turning to Slide 21. In addition to maximizing our current fleet, our expected future earnings growth from today's normalized levels will be fueled by the transformational growth profile we already have in the pipeline, representing a 50% growth in capacity versus 2019 levels. As Frank touched on, we welcome this new capacity given our company and more broadly, the cruise industry's under penetration within the larger leisure landscape. Our new ships have a very favorable and efficient financing structure locked in at the time of contract which results in an expected immediate boost to profitability once they enter service. For all new builds on order, our financing is committed at fixed rates averaging approximately 2.5% over the portfolio. Another important component of our newbuild pipeline is that well prior to a ship delivery, we are already receiving significant cash flows in the form of advanced ticket sales and presale of onboard revenue streams. This typically equates to roughly $100 million to $150 million of cash inflow from future bookings prior to a vessel's first revenue sailing essentially resulting in a cash infusion into the business that continues to build over time as final payments for future voyages also become due. Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while we are proud of the tremendous progress we have made to date, we are not taking our foot off the gas, and are relentlessly focused on executing our medium- and long-term financial strategy as laid out on Slide 22. We are keeping a close watch on the macroeconomic environment and are preparing to adapt to any potential scenario, but we are confident we are taking the right steps to set up our company for a successful future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which Slide 23 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we continue to advance our commitment to pursue net 0 greenhouse gas emissions. We successfully completed the testing of a biodiesel fuel blend on Regen\u2019s Seven Seas Splendor founder in October, and we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with MAN Energy Solutions to conduct a feasibility study and retrofitting an existing engine to operate with dual fuels, diesel and methanol. We will continue to evaluate a variety of alternative fuels and share learnings with other companies as we collectively try to find a viable long-term solution. In September, after Hurricane Ian had a devastating impact to our neighbors in Southwest Florida, we responded as quickly and as generously as we could and donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross to assist in emergency relief efforts. We also committed to matching donations from team members, business partners, travel agents and concerned guests and others in our network up to an additional $100,000. And before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 24. First, we believe we are very well positioned in the current economic environment given NCLH's unique drivers, which have allowed us to excel financially in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Second, we are hitting our targets and reaching key milestones in our path back to normalcy. We are focused on laying the foundation for long-term sustainable profitability for 2023 and beyond. Third, our target upmarket consumer continues to hold strong, which is reflected in our excellent book position and significantly higher pricing for '23 and as well as our impressive onboard revenue performance. And lastly, our cash generation engine has wrapped up, which, along with our new build pipeline provides a clear path for return to meaningful profitability and a deleveraging of our balance sheet in the coming years. We've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude right now with our commentary and open the call for your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Jessica John : Before we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address a top question from our new online shareholder Q&A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and up vote questions for management.  Several of the top questions we received this quarter were centered around the same key theme, which was our comfort around our current financial position and liquidity, particularly if we face an economic slowdown or recession. Mark, do you want to answer that one? Mark Kempa : Sure. Thanks, Jessica. And it's very exciting to have this new engagement platform being utilized by our broad shareholder base. So nice step forward. Look, we feel good about our liquidity position today, which is north of $2.2 billion. And as I said, that consisted of cash of $1.2 billion and the $1 billion undrawn commitment. As I said in my prepared remarks, based on our current projections and trajectory, we do believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs organically. So far, despite the heightened concerns around the economy, we have not seen any signs of a pullback from our target consumer. We continue to believe that we are better -- relatively better positioned in the event of an economic downturn given our brands skewed to the higher end of their respective market categories. And that results in a more upmarket consumer, which typically has been very resilient to weaker economic environments. So we'll continue to monitor the evolving landscape, and we're preparing for multiple scenarios. But overall, we feel confident that if faced with challenges, we will demonstrate our resilience as we have done so many times in the past. Operator : Our first question from the line comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : A couple of questions for you regarding commissions. Certainly been a lot of news about your changes in the -- and could you tell why is now the right time for that? And then related to that, it would seem that this is something your competitors could do and if they did it, maybe this -- it's sort of a net 0, if everybody is doing it. Why do you see a competitive advantage of doing that at this time? And then I'll have one more follow-up question. Frank Del Rio : Patrick, it's Frank. A couple of reasons. Number one, the travel agency community is not fully yet back to pre-pandemic levels, at least not for the cruise space. Because while we were out and remember, we were out nearly 500 days, travel agents had to continue making a living, and they made a living by selling more land resorts, more land vacations than they ever had before and they're still doing it. So we have to find a way to draw them back to the cruise industry and away from the land vacations, which is our #1 competitor anyway as opposed to other cruise brands. And we think this is a way to do it. We actually did an experiment over the summer using a relatively good-sized sample. And we found that travel agents who were paid commissions on these non-commissionable fares increased their business with us significantly such that the revenue that they generated over a long period of time, more than offset the increase in commission expense. So we think this is an ROI type of move.  In many ways, I hope the competition does match this because I think it will be great overall for the travel agency community, which we all rely on. And at the end of the day, it's not about so much about commission savings, it's all about generating additional revenue and filling the vessels that are coming online for us and for the rest of the industry. So I know if no company has ever made their mark by saving and saving and saving, you make your mark on the top line. And this is what this -- that's what this move is meant to do to generate more revenue. And your second question, Patrick? Patrick Scholes : Yes. That makes sense. Just taking a look actually at the 3Q results, and this was also for 2Q as well. Can you remind us why, again, and this was before you made your commission change. Why were commissions and onboard cost rates so much higher than comparable in 2019? Mark Kempa : Patrick, this is Mark. I touched on that last quarter. So if you recall, as part of our overall Free at Sea and part of our broader bundling package we introduced a significantly new air program. So we started to see some of the cost of that flowing through in the second quarter. And then, of course, if you look at the third quarter, that's where most of our ships are often the more premium and exotic itinerary. So you do see a higher cost of air component within that. That said, on a net-net basis, it does drive better overall net revenue per diems, and that's certainly evidenced by our performance in the last 2 to 3 quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. I wonder if you could sort of put a range for us around when you talk about price being up significantly for 2023 to get a sense of what range that may be? I know you had given a range with Q2 results and indicated that, that would come down as load moved up. But wondering if you'd sort of give a similar ballpark. Mark Kempa : Robin, it's Mark. So I'm going to hold Frank back off on that one because I think if you recall last quarter, we said it was going to be a onetime data point. So I have to be the bad guy in the room. Look, our pricing, as we said 30 days ago, is significantly up. We reiterated that today in our release. It's up. I cannot give you a range. We gave you the onetime data point. We did say that -- we would expect that to level off, but it's up significantly. And again, that is all part of our phased ramp-up strategy. We're protecting price. We want the consumer to pay more. Yes, are we -- is there an offset in the very short term that we are sacrificing a small amount of load factor. Yes, we've said that, but that is part of our strategy. We expect to be back at normalized load factors in the second -- for the second quarter of next year. So we are right on path. We are right on track with our intentional actions. And all I can tell you is that pricing is up, and that continues to show in both our actual results. And if you recall in my prepared remarks, I said that gross pricing is expected to be up 20% in Q4. So if you think about that, you can kind of get an idea of where we're trending. But all signs are looking good for next year. Robin Farley : That's great. And just as a follow-up, just to clarify on your comments about the expense -- the net cruise costs for 2023. You said it would normalize in 2023. Will that be as soon as Q1? In other words, is this extremely elevated cost here in -- is it just a Q4 thing or is it going to take you a couple of quarters to normalize? Just trying to clarify what sort of in 2020, is it by 2023 at some point during 2023? Mark Kempa : Yes, great question. So look, if we look at Q3, where our cost came in and if you do the math and you imply where Q4 is, it's coming down slightly. Look, it's going to be a tapering down. And what I would broadly guide you to is that when you look at FY '23, certainly not in the first quarter, but when you look at the year on a whole, you're probably looking at net cruise costs down at least mid-single digits from the prior year. And obviously, we expect to do better than that. But you have to really look at the composition of what's going in there. And if you look at the third and fourth quarter, we do still have some trailing COVID-related costs, whether it's testing, additional crew, that is tapering off in the quarter. So we did see some ramping down in Q4 related to that. In Q3, we had a significant launch of the new class of vessel, Prima. That's a drag on cost. But the other thing to keep in mind, too, is that starting next year or in '23, we no longer have quarantine cabins that are out of service. So while - and that's a double impact because if you think about that in '22 and especially in Q3 and Q4, from a unit cost standpoint, that impacts our denominator from a capacity day basis.  So by the mere fact that we have -- we are putting those cabins back into revenue sale mode, so to speak, for 2023, it will inherently reduce our unit cost but we're also going to get the benefit from additional revenue. So there's a lot of moving parts in 2022. It's just, as I said before, it's a bit of a noisy and bumpy year. But I'll go back to the expectation that at least we expect mid-single-digit decreases and we're going to do everything in our power to do much better than that. Robin Farley : Just to make sure I understand, when you're saying down mid-single digit, is that year-over-year, are you saying then sort of relative to '19 that the cost could still be up like 20% or 30%? I'm trying to do the math on the slide here, so maybe -- Mark Kempa : I won't let you do the math, but I did say in my prepared remarks that we expect cost to be up versus '19 and '23. Recall, we did not have the benefit of removing any older ships from the fleet nor did we have the benefit of selling any higher operating cost brands vis-a-vis some of the broader industry. So when I'm talking about at least what I -- my commentary on mid-single digits, that's off where we are in terms of run rate for Q3 and Q4 of this year, not the entire FY '22. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : So probably for you, Mark. But I want to start with the balance sheet. And we recently saw one of your peers lay out some longer, let's call it, longer-term financial targets in which they see a path back to investment grade over the next let's call it, a couple of years. Just wondering if you guys have thought about a similar path and maybe what the next couple of years might look like from a deleveraging perspective is I think I remember you guys had some massive deleveraging. I think that was post 2014 or 2015 in which you basically cut your leverage in half over, let's call it, a 3- or 4-year period. Also noticed, Mark, your CapEx forecast for 2024 dropped a good bit from last quarter, and I assume that's just your Prima class plus ship getting pushed back into early '25, but that's going to allow you guys to generate some significant free cash flow as well in '24, which potentially could help your deleveraging path. That all makes sense. Mark Kempa : Steve, that's a lot to unpack there, but I'll start with, first and foremost, yes, we think about it every day in terms of where this business is going and the opportunity and how do we get back to pre-pandemic levels. As we stated 30 days ago in our investor event, we are charting a path back to success. And first and foremost, that means rightsizing the business, getting the business back to full operating capacity, which is just around the corner. That's going to result in significant cash flow, and that results in delevering and derisking the balance sheet. So that is what the entire management team as well as our Board is focused on. I've said that before, I said that in 30 days ago, I'm telling you again today. We need to delever this company. We've done it before. We've taken the company down from 9, 10x levered to where we were in the end of '19 at low 3s going into the 2. So as we look forward, and if I have a crystal ball, as I said at the investor event is we want to turn -- we want to finish FY '23 with a 5-point X handle in leverage. And then our goal in 24 is a 4x handle and then 3x handle. So we obviously have a path of how we can do that. We need to continue to execute. We need a relatively stable environment, but signs are looking good. We're getting where we need to be. Our strategy is working. Will there be bumps in the road? Yes, there's going to be bumps in the road, but we've proven time and again that we can get past that. What was the last part of your question now? Steve Wieczynski : The CapEx. Mark Kempa : Yes. Sorry about that. Yes, you're absolutely right. So Look, as we said in our earnings release, we do have a slight delay with the LEO 3 and 4 class vessels. And that is strictly 100% as a result of shipyard delays from supply chain constraints. I think on average -- those ships are being delayed on average by about 4 to 5 months each vessel. So that just really just simply pushes some of your CapEx from '24 to '25 and so forth. So a little bit of an opportunity. Certainly, not a huge shift, but given where the world is today, we think that's okay. And that's going to further help us when we think about next year of having -- over the next couple of years, having slightly better lower CapEx that should provide more cash to the business. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Understood. And then if I could ask 1 more question. I know I asked a bunch to you, Mark, but maybe for Frank. Maybe just how you're thinking about the next 4 or 5 months from a booking perspective. And I guess what I'm getting at here is you obviously have had a lot of strong booking activity since all the COVID restrictions have been removed and whatnot. But maybe just how you're thinking wave season should start to gear up here over the next, call it, 4 or 5 weeks. How are you guys kind of thinking about the booking patterns over the next couple of months? Are you expecting kind of a normalized wave season from here? Frank Del Rio : No, I think it will be an extraordinary wave season. It's already started, 10 days doesn't make a trend necessarily. But the last 10 days, the Norwegian brand had its best 10-day streak ever, ever. And I think that's going to carry on throughout the fourth quarter and into wave. Wave is -- it is a consumer event, but travel agents get behind it. And travel agents haven't had a wave in 3 years, and they're excited. And when I see travel agent is excited, I can't help but join them. So I really think that the next 4 months, 5 months into the end of March, which is typically the end of the wave season are going to be exceptionally strong booking periods. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Dan Politzer : So Mark, I just wanted to follow up in terms of the spend cadence. I know you mentioned down mid-single digits versus that second half run rate for net cruise costs in 2022. But as we think about for 2023 and I guess the cadence over the course of the year, it sounds like it's going to be certainly front-end weighted. Is that mostly the elevated marketing cost? And then as you kind of exit 2023, how should we think about the net cruise costs? Mark Kempa : Yes. Look, I think when you look at the cadence, while it is still a bit early to give exact guidance on cadence, we're still going through all of our operating plans internally. I think it's fair to say that Q1 is going to be probably a bit higher than Q2 would be. And then naturally, I think we're going to start to see more scale in Q2 and Q3. So you're going to continue to see a downward trend. And as you're looking at your models, keep in mind, we do have 3 new ships that we're taking delivery of next year. So there will be some start-up costs related to those. So just keep that in mind. But it's going to be a downward slope next year. And you're going to -- we're already starting to see that take effect. Look, as we look into 2024, we're going to continue to garner scale benefit as we take on new capacity. We believe that throughout the course of 2023, we're going to find opportunities, and we're rightsizing the business from some of the cost creep that we've just seen over the last 2 to 3 years. We've had to take hard looks at ourselves and make sure we're doing all the right things.  Our first and foremost, we wanted to make sure we were getting back operating in a healthy and safe manner. We've done that. We're doing it. Now we're focusing on what does it take to deliver that product. So we are focused on it. we're attacking it from every angle. But you're going to -- it will be a slow downward trend, and -- But too early to comment on 2024, but just on the surface, we will see some scale benefit. Dan Politzer : Got it. And just for my follow-up. In terms of 2023, you gave your deployment mix, which I think was pretty helpful. So as we think about pricing and the top line, to what extent do you attribute that --the pricing tracking higher to this more attractive or optimized itinerary of mix with less Caribbean, more Europe, more Alaska and Asia Pac versus 2019? Or is this more your market to fill strategy and kind of just holding the line on pricing? Frank Del Rio : I think it's a little bit of both, Dan, especially the Norwegian brand has pivoted to longer, more exotic, higher-yielding itineraries that book earlier, there's no such thing as a good close in bookings, and that's one of the things that we're trying to get away from. It's part of the strategy over the paying NCF. By the way, I feel to mention that NCFs are only paid commission if the booking is more than 120 days from booking date. And there's a big demarcation of the quality, the pricing of a booking that is made early rather than close in. But yes, we've made no bones about that we hold price. We lead the industry by such a wide margin on price that it's almost untouchable and we continue to grow. You see what we've done in second quarter, third quarter of this year compared to our peers, what we're projecting for Q4. We're projecting for 2023. That is the central theme of our go-to-market strategy, and we accomplish it by marketing to fall by bundling and by having top line product on board. So that's going to continue. It is core to our strategy. it's price, price, price. And that's why, as Mark mentioned, we have taken a very disciplined approach to filling. We don't care if we're behind others by a quarter or 2 in terms of load factor, we simply won't sacrifice price because we've seen historically that those who drop prices to ridiculous levels in order to fill take years, if not decades, to recover, and we're simply not prepared to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company. Vince Ciepiel : A little bit longer term, curious, Frank, your perspective on kind of finding the balance of growing capacity with continuing to source the strongest guests, providing unique and interesting itineraries. I know you talked a little bit about the low penetration rates of crews. I imagine share gains is kind of part of it. But how are you thinking about kind of managing that build along with continuing to have poor capacity and interesting itineraries to meet that demand you're going after. Frank Del Rio : That's our secret sauce, Vince, if I tell you, everyone will do it. But I will tell you that there are just dozens, dozens of either underpenetrated or places that we simply don't go because we don't have enough vessels. Just in the U.S., there are cities in the U.S. that are historically very strong source markets that we don't have a vessel, either seasonally or at least -- or year round. And we think that with new vessels coming online, we'll be able to do that. Alaska, where we've made huge investments in land-based infrastructures and ports, we're still underpenetrated. The Norwegian brand, for example, only has 4 vessels there. Oceania and Regent only one each. Our competitors have multiples of that. And the reason for that is, is that we need to be in other places.  So we see Alaska, we see Europe as growth markets. We believe South America is becoming very, very interesting, greater demand for South American ports. Asia has taken a backseat over the last couple of years because of the COVID situation there. But I got to tell you, Japan is red hot for us. Australia is red hot. And so I'm excited about the possibility of going to new places with new ships and continuing to just feed the beast of high-yielding itineraries. You've heard me say before, Vince, itineraries is the #1 driver of yield. And we think that we do itineraries better than most, and we'll continue to do so. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And second for Mark, there's a little bit of confusion on the cost front, and I know you guys don't want to give specific guidance, so I maybe wanted to come at this from a different direction. When you talk about record EBITDA in 2023, which sounds like you guys still feel good about like getting there is some component of price and costs. But as you think about managing the business from a margin perspective, obviously, fuel is outside of your control. But as you just think about the next 1 to 2 years, those margins ex-fuel, aka the relationship between price and operating costs. Any reason to think that, that would be a departure from kind of where you've been historically? Mark Kempa : Vince, absolutely not. We've talked about this before. And I'm not going to sit here and tell you today that there is not near-term pressure on margins. We've said there is. We acknowledge that, I'd be a fool not to say that. But I think when you look out over the course of the next year or 2 and you look at where the business is going and where the costs will settle, right? This hyperinflationary environment cannot last forever. And we are taking actions internally as well to ensure that we're rightsizing all of the cost of the business. But more importantly, we believe the operating leverage of this industry and more particularly our company is intact. Is it going to be there in the next quarter or 2, I think that's going to be a challenge. But when you look over the next 1 to 2 years, certainly, we believe this industry gets back to pre-COVID margin levels and plus. But as I said in my remarks, it is not going to be an overnight flip of the switch. So it's going to take some time. But without a doubt, this industry, we believe, is intact from a margin perspective. Frank Del Rio : And Vince, that's why maintaining those high prices is so important because we can control that or at least we can greatly influence pricing and the relationship between marketing and sales and all our distribution channels, whereas do you acknowledge that we don't control the cost of fuel, but we don't really control the cost of beef or carrots or onions or a lot of other things that we consume. And unless you're prepared to slash and burn the product, which will in turn affect your pricing, the best way to control margins or influence margins positively is through pricing, which is what we do. Operator : Our next question comes from James Hardiman with Citi. James Hardiman : Some of this has been covered, but I just want to make sure we're able to sort of unpack the difference between gross pricing and net pricing, right? In the third quarter, I think gross was up 14% versus 2019. And net was up 5%. It sounds like the difference is some of the bundling of the airfare, I guess, as we move forward, some of the NCF stuff is going to be in there. So I guess, as we look to 2023, -- how should we think about the gap between those 2? Should we expect that to widen even further as we move forward? Or does some of that stuff sort of peel back? Mark Kempa : Vince, it's Mark. So you're absolutely right. When you look at the last 2 to 3 quarters, the differential between gross to net has been about anywhere from 8 to 9 points, I think, when you look at the second and third quarter. So if you look at where our implied guidance is for Q4 and you do the math, you're probably going to get to a spread of about 7 points. So our best view of everything we can see, given the bundling, getting back to normalized load factor levels and full ships, it's probably going to be somewhere in the zone of that 7 to 8-point differential on a run rate basis. Now could it be higher or lower in a particular quarter, it may be a point or 2. But I think generally speaking, we're looking at somewhere around that 7-point differential. James Hardiman : Got it. That's really helpful. And then Obviously, one of the things that shaped this year, maybe less so for you than some of your peers. But obviously, wave season was hijacked by Omicron and you had the Ukraine conflict, I know it's difficult. But is there any way to quantify or estimate what type of an impact that, that ultimately had on your business this year? And I'm assuming that it's primarily a pricing impact more so than occupancy, but maybe walk us through that. Ultimately, I'm just trying to think through or think about what this year would have looked like with a more normal wave season, which I think we're all hoping that, that is the case in 2023. Frank Del Rio : Yes, James, it would have looked a lot better. If you look back at all the major changes that took place starting in early June when the U.S. government no longer required people to test to get back into the country. That was a huge one. It was only 4 or 5 months ago, I think we all want to put COVID so far behind us that we forget some of these major milestones that occurred just very recently. Then of course, the CDC dropping their protocols and allowing us to do what we're doing now, that all has contributed to less friction with consumers, bringing travel agents back to the fold, so to speak. And so that's why I'm so excited about this upcoming wave period because it doesn't have all the burdens that the last 2 or 3 had. But specifically to your question about Q3 pricing and Ukraine, look, if you had asked me what is the single city in the world, port in the world that you cannot live without, I'd tell you it's St. Petersburg, and we lost it. Very, very high yields, incredible shore excursion sales. So onboard revenue was just higher than any other itineraries that I can think of, relatively long season. You can get to St. Pete in the Baltic in mid-May and you can leave in mid-September. So it's a real blow. It's a real blow. And so by -- we kept most of the ships there, although 1 vessel came out of the Baltic, and we send it to the Caribbean, which is about as extreme from one to the other that you can think of. So it did affect load factors and no question, it affected pricing. And the impact on EBITDA has to be in the tens of millions of dollars. Operator : Our next question is with Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. Paul Golding : I wanted to ask a bit of a follow-on question with Europe. Given the protracted geopolitical issues, I'm looking at the deployment mix for '23. It looks like Europe is up in terms of plan for '23 deployment mix versus '19. So I just wanted to get a sense of the demand picture for presumably the North American cruiser. Is that still strong for Europe despite the geopolitics. And is that a tailwind that we should see also given the 85% North American sourcing comment from prior? Frank Del Rio : Yes, I think it is a tailwind for several reasons. One, it was until midsummer that Americans were allowed back into the U.S. unless they had to test. And so this revenge travel or pent-up demand that we've been talking about for months is really alive and well for Americans going to Europe. And we want Americans going to Europe because they do sell the -- buy the highest cabin categories book early and also because of the strength of the dollar. I mean, going to Europe now, even though you do pay -- Americans do pay in dollars for our cruises here, they're going to spend a lot more money and enjoy themselves a lot more once they get to Europe. So we do believe that Europe is poised for an incredible 2023 season. That's why we increased our capacity there by 6 percentage points of occupancy at the expense of the Caribbean. And I'll take that trade all day long because the yields both on ticket and on onboard revenue are so dramatically better for European cruises that we'll take that trade. Paul Golding : And then maybe staying on the topic of Eastern Europe, I was wondering if there's been any change to the positive side in terms of cost with respect to your onboard labor costs due to the issues in Europe? Are you seeing any benefits there? And maybe more structurally short side, even though I know it's a smaller piece. Any change in the structural labor cost picture there in general? Frank Del Rio : No change at all. The vast majority of our onboard crew come from Asia, not from Eastern Europe. Things have changed. 20 years ago, it was Western Europeans, became Eastern Europeans. Now it's primarily Asian. So no positive question whatsover. We have an -- operator, question for 1 more -- time for one more question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress. Ivan Feinseth : Congratulations on another great quarter and the ongoing progress. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Ivan. Ivan Feinseth : The big gain in onboard spending, what are the key drivers of that? What are you seeing being most popular that cruisers are spending on? Frank Del Rio : We're seeing it in experiences. So our casino is doing really, really well. We're going to give Vegas a run for their money. People are enjoying the destinations. We have industry-leading itinerary. So show excursion business is up. Our cuisine is second to none, and people are enjoying cuisines. But even our spa, our spa is doing very, very well. And so I'm happy for the folks over at One World Spa. Ivan Feinseth : And then Mark had commented a couple of times about you seeing slight moderation in commodity, food commodity prices. Are you still seeing those trends? Or what's your outlook there? Mark Kempa : Yes, Ivan. We continue to see that. Certain categories are trending down and they're starting to get into their historical averages. We're not -- certainly not where we would like them to be or need them to be, but we are seeing continued momentum in there. But I wish it was quicker, but we're at the mercy of the rest of the world. But again, we're seeing positive momentum on that front. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We ran a little bit over time, but those were all great questions, and we were happy to have the opportunity to answer them. As always, our team will be standing by to answer any of your questions. Have a great day, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is John, and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Ms. John. Please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Harry Sommer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which, Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year like no other in our company's 56-year history. As we successfully concluded our great cruise come back, with the last vessel in our fleet reentering service midway through the year. Our team continually push forward to this challenging transition year, achieving several significant milestones on our road to recovery and preparing for the next chapter of our storied brands. With our full fleet back to the high seas, we significantly ramped up occupancy levels carrying nearly 1.7 million guests welcomed our newest ship, Norwegian Prima to our world-class fleet, reached several critical financial inflection points, maintained our industry-leading pricing and perhaps more telling, ended the year in a record booked position for 2023 and at record prices. These accomplishments are even more impressive when considering they were achieved against the backdrop of lingering COVID-19 impacts as well as ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. I want to take the opportunity to once again thank our entire team, both shore-side and shipboard for their hard work, dedication and tenacity, which has propelled us forward as we strive to be the vacation of choice for everyone around the world. I'm incredibly proud, honored and inspired to work alongside each and every one of you. And I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, value travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors and all of our stakeholders for their continued support and partnership. Shifting our attention to what is certainly a bright future for our company, let's turn to slide six, which outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we have on the horizon. First, we are encouraged to see that our target consumer, which tends to skew more upmarket in the broader cruise industry, continues to be financially healthy and resilient and is prioritizing consumption of experiences over the purchase of physical goods. We've talked previously about the two high-level indicators we carefully monitor to evaluate the willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel. The first being the length of the booking curve, which is a forward-looking indicator and the second one being onboard revenue, a real-time indicator of a consumer's actual spending, both of which continue to hold strong with no signs of fading. In fact, the booking window in the fourth quarter was well elongated compared to the same quarter in 2019. Onboard revenue also continues to be a bright spot with gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, approximately 25% higher than the comparable 2019 period. The bottom-line is our target consumer continues to be willing to spend on travel and experiences now and in the future. This gives us confidence that not only is the incredible value proposition for cruising resonating with consumers, but the unique and compelling offerings of our three brands are also appealing to their respective markets. Second, we are taking actions across our business to align with our strategic priorities and strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth. This includes a broad and ongoing initiative we began in the fourth quarter to improve operating efficiencies and to right-size our cost base so that we can rebuild and enhance our margins. You may ask why start this initiative now? While the past few years have been unlike anything we could have imagined. First, we were focused on taking the necessary measures to withstand a prolonged and unprecedented period of disruption by minimizing cash burn, raising capital, enhancing our health and safety programs to adapt to a rapidly evolving public health environment and advocating for the industry to restart cruise operations. We then shifted our focus to relaunching our operations while providing our discerning guests the same unparalleled vacation experience they expect from our leading brands. We also took this unique opportunity to raise the bar on pricing for the long-term. Now that our phased occupancy ramp is nearly complete, and our loyal guests know that cruising in our brands is back and even better than before, we are squarely focused on how to maximize profitability as we embark on a period of transformational growth. Every aspect of our business is being evaluated through the lens of how we can realize our full value potential for all stakeholders. We are exploring further opportunities, first and foremost, to reduce our cost profile and to maximize revenue generation. You've likely seen some of the actions we've already taken to improve our cost structure, including normalization of marketing spend, corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and thoughtful rationalization of product delivery. We will continue to leave no stone on turn as we identify and evaluate incremental opportunities. And of course, we will not lose sight of our guests, the very heart of our business, and we will continue to prioritize delivering an exceptional guest experience and superior service levels. The last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading newbuild pipeline. This year, for the first time in our history, we are gearing up to deliver one newbuild for each of our brands, as shown on slide seven, adding over 5,000 additional berths to our fleet including an over 20% increase in our upscale berths. On a capacity day basis, this will result in approximately 19% growth in 2023 compared to 2019. As you can see on slide eight, we have made some modifications to our newbuild pipeline primarily related to the last two shifts in the Prima Class. These ships have been lengthened in part to accommodate the future use of alternative fuels. We now expect gross tonnage for the third and fourth Prima Class to be approximately 10% larger and the fifth and sixth Pima Class ships to be approximately 20% larger than Norwegian, Prima and Viva. As a result, delivery days have shifted a bit, and we now expect one larger Prima Class ship to be delivered each year from 2025 to 2028. We remain confident in our ability to profitably absorb this capacity with continued consumer demand for travel, our expansion into the many unserved and underserved markets around the world that our brands have not yet tapped into, and on the broader industry's vast under-penetration particularly when compared to land-based vacation alternatives. Shifting our discussion now to our booking, demand and pricing trends. As you can see on slide nine, in the fourth quarter, our load factor reached 87%, in line with guidance. This is approximately 20% below the comparable 2019 quarter, yet demonstrates another sequential improvement in closing the occupancy gap versus 2019. This ramp is continuing through the first quarter of 2023 as we have already achieved 100% occupancy in the quarter, leading to a return to historical levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. In terms of pricing, slide 10, illustrates another strong result in the pricing front with our net per DM growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, up approximately 14% on an as reported basis and up 15% in constant currency over 2019. Turning to slide 11, at year end, our cumulative book position for 2023 was within our optimal range of approximately 60% to 65%. We continue to believe this is our sweet spot as it strikes the delicate balance of encouraging guests to book early while also optimizing pricing. Full year 2023 book position is now ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices. Since we last spoke in November, we have been pleased to see positive booking momentum continue, including a very strong wave season that likely started two months earlier than usual. In fact, November was a record-breaking month for Norwegian Cruise Line as they celebrate a record day, record week and record month of sales boosted by Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday push. Subsequently, in January, a strong start to traditional wave led the line of setting another record booking month. Our Regent brand also experienced a similar positive reception to it 2023 wave offer launch, which resulted in a record launch day with net booking volume nearly four times last year's wave launch and 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our current cumulative book position and the strong demand dynamics that we continue to experience across our brands gives us further confidence that we can achieve our 2023 guidance, which Mark will discuss shortly in more detail. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2022 financial results, 2023 guidance and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics is on a constant currency basis. Slide 12 outlines key metrics highlighting our fourth quarter results, nearly all of which met or exceeded guidance. Focusing on the top line, strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise in the quarter, up approximately 24% versus 2019, with net per diems increasing approximately 15%, continuing the strong pricing performance we have achieved since our re-launch. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, was in line with expectations, with the second half 2022 decreasing approximately 10% versus the first half as our operations continue to ramp up. As our 2023 guidance indicates, second half 2022 is not representative of a go-forward run rate. For the second half of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was nearly breakeven. We did, however, achieve another significant milestone in the fourth quarter, generating positive adjusted free cash flow for the first time in three years. This represents another stepping stone as we return to a normalized operating environment. Looking at expectations for the full year 2023 on slide 14. We are pleased to return to our normal cadence of providing annual and quarterly guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion with the high end of our targeted range, representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.70 at the midpoint of our guidance. Taking a closer look at the components of this outlook, net per diem growth is expected in the range of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019. This translates to net yield for the year expected to increase in the range of 5% to 6.5%. This stellar top line performance is reflective of our go-to-market strategy and emphasis on price discipline. Moving to costs, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $160 for the full year. This represents a nearly 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. The key drivers of this expected decrease includes the scaling back and normalization of marketing investments, which were elevated in the second half of 2022 as we focused on resetting expectations and raising the bar on pricing during our re-launch; moderation in hyperinflationary pressures in certain areas, including food and logistics; normalization of capacity days as a result of the elimination of previously acquired protocols; timing and optimization of scheduled drydocks; and finally, the results of our operating efficiency and cost minimization efforts as part of our broad and ongoing margin enhancement initiative that Frank touched on. Keep in mind that costs are expected to sequentially trend lower over the course of the year as occupancy increases and reduction initiatives are realized, which is expected to lead to a lower cost run rate as we exit 2023 as compared to our full year guidance. As we have consistently communicated, our costs will be elevated when compared to 2019 baseline, both due to normal and hyperinflation over the past three years to four years as well as a mixed headwind as we add higher operating cost capacity, which we do expect will gain a premium on the top-line. I want to reiterate that we are committed to right-sizing our cost base and are taking deliberate actions across our business to best position us for the future as a stronger and leaner organization. There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies, while continuing to deliver an exceptional guest experience. Our goal is not only to rebuild our margins, but over time, continue to enhance them, and we look forward to demonstrating this improvement over the coming quarters. Now, let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. Compared to 2019 levels, net per diem is expected to increase approximately 6.75% to 7.75%, while net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.25% to 2.25%, primarily as a result of our continued occupancy ramp and with pricing expected to be higher for the remaining quarters of 2023. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 12% below the second half of 2022. First quarter is expected to be the highest cost quarter due to lower occupancy and as actions taken in recent months to reduce costs will not yet be fully realized. When looking at our implied guidance for the remaining quarters of 2023, the expected decrease in cost is approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2022. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $195 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be a loss of approximately $0.45. Moving to our balance sheet. Slide 15 demonstrates the results of our deliberate and opportunistic measures to optimize our debt maturity profile. In 2023, we have approximately $1 billion of scheduled debt service, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. In recent months, we also addressed a large portion of our 2024 maturities. First, we completed an amendment of our operating credit facility and extended approximately $1.4 billion of this facility by one year to January 2025. Earlier this month, we took advantage of significant improvements in the bond markets to complete a refinancing transaction of the remaining non-extended term loans under the operating credit facility. We issued $600 million of new 8.375% [ph] senior secured notes due 2028 and use the proceeds to repay these term loans, allowing us to de-risk and replace near-term debt maturities with longer-dated debt at only a marginally higher cost. As you can see, with these actions, we have a manageable maturity profile over the course of the next few years. When you look at the totality of our debt, approximately 40% is ECA back debt. This is a unique differentiator of the cruise industry, which is part of a broader connected ecosystem, which includes, among others, the operators, the shipyards and the governments and export credit agencies, all of which rely on shipyards and suppliers for significant economic and employment related benefits. As all of our interests closely align, these partners are incredibly supportive, as demonstrated by the very efficient financing we are able to secure for our new-builds as well as the support they provided during the pandemic. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments, we also provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website. Turning to liquidity, our overall liquidity position remains strong. And just last night, we announced two transactions, which further enhance our liquidity and outlined on page -- on slide 16. First, we revised and extend our existing $1 billion undrawn backstop commitment, as part of the agreement to secure a second year extension option on the commitment, the company issued $250 million of 9.75% notes due 2028. At the same time, we revised the undrawn commitment to reduce the amount to $650 million, with the agreement now extending through February 2024, with the option at our sole election to extend through 2025. We do not currently intend to draw on this commitment. And in total, the combination of these two actions provides the company approximately $900 million of liquidity to the bottom-line. Second, we also entered into a new $300 million unsecured and undrawn backstop commitment. This facility will be available to draw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. Securing this facility provides a backstop for the remaining portion of the non-extending operating credit facility which matures in January 2024. Pro forma for these recent transactions, our liquidity position at year-end is approximately $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $650 million, under the available commitment. For housekeeping, this does not include the enhancement to future liquidity we obtained with the $300 million undrawn commitment as it is currently not available to draw. Before handing the call back -- handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate our relentless focus on executing on our medium- and long-term financial strategy, as laid out on slide 18. We will continue to be opportunistic and are committed to delivering value for all stakeholders. But most of all, we are excited to be back in full operation and once again delivering incredible vacation experiences on our three brands to all corners of the globe. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which slide 19 outlines, a few key highlights. Since we last spoke, we have made meaningful progress to advance our commitment to pursue net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We successfully completed the testing of biodiesel fuel blends on three additional ships in our fleet, a promising potential lever to help reduce emissions on our existing fleet. In addition, we recently modified our contracts to the final two PRIMA Class Ships for Norwegian Cruise Line scheduled for delivery in 2027 and 2028 to reconfigure these ships to accommodate green methanol and as an alternative fuel source in the future. While additional modifications will be needed in the future to fully enable the use of dual fuel, both methanol and diesel, this action reinforces our commitment to decarbonization and represents an important and exciting step forward in our pursuit of net zero. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on slide 20. First, we believe we are well positioned in the current economic environment and our target upmarket consumer remains resilient. This is especially true for the all-import North American consumer from we enjoy an outsized benefit, given our strategic sourcing mix and focus on global versus national brands. Second, booking momentum is positive, buoyed by a strong start to the year with wave season, and we are pleased with our book position and pricing for 2023. Third, we are focused on strengthening the foundation for sustained profitable growth, and we will continue to take strategic measures to best position the company for its next era. And lastly, our cash generation engine continues to rev up which, along with our transformational new build pipeline provides a path to meet our liquidity needs and to restore our balance sheet in the coming years. We've covered quite a bit today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Frank. [Operator Instructions] Jessica John : Before we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address a top question from our online shareholder Q&A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and upvote questions from management. The top question this quarter was what are our plans to bring in new customers and also reward brand loyalists to entice them to cruise. Frank, do you want to take that one? Frank Del Rio : Sure. I think both past guests and new guests are absolutely critical for our continued growth. We have a great base of loyal guests who love our product because each of our brands have incredibly high repeat rates running anywhere from 45% for the Norwegian brand to as high as 55% for region. And we're always looking for new ways to engage with them, including through our popular loyalty programs that each brand operates. We also have a robust new build pipeline as we just finished discussing. One new build being introduced for each brand this year alone and we all know new ships and above surrounding new ships have historically brought outsized attention to the brand. Just consider the buzz when Katy Perry performed as godmother of Norwegian Prima this past summer. And just recently, Giada De Laurentiis was named Godmother of Oceania upcoming Vista, which highlights the brand's focus on having the fun is to choosing it see. These announcements create excitement, not just among loyal guests, but also to new brand and even new to cruise guests. You've heard us say many times that the cruise industry as a whole is vastly underpenetrated, and we have significantly -- have a significant runway ahead to attract new to cruise guests, creating awareness, drawing buzz, partnering with a traveling community even having investors such as yourselves, deliver the message, of the value and unique experiences that cruises offer is a large part of what we do every single day, and we'll continue to do so to drive that message to as many possible guess as we possibly can. Operator : Thank you, Frank. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dan Politzer : Hi, good morning. Frank. Good morning, Mark. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to touch first on the balance sheet. Obviously, there's a lot of work that you guys have been doing there. How do you think about leverage this year, next year? And to what extent is your appetite to issue equity relative to debt? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Hi, good morning Dan. Well, first and foremost, the discussion of issuing equity is a Board decision. So, I will leave it there, but what I can tell you is that, that has not been in discussion in any of our Board meetings. We've said time and time and again, we do not believe that it is prudent to issue more equity to de-lever the company. As we look forward and we look at our balance sheet, we have said that our internal goal here is we want to turn the year with a 5x handle. And for clarification, that does include an adjustment for the newbuilds that we take delivery of in this year since we do not have the full earnings potential. But that's what the company has rallied around, and that's what we're focused on. We've said before, it's not an easy task, but we're rallying against that, and that's what we're using as our stake in the sand. So, there's a lot of opportunity ahead in the industry and especially for our company for the year. We are in a dynamic environment, all signs that we see are looking good, and that's evidenced by our pricing power and our Q4 results as well as our guidance for the year. But nevertheless, there is some unknowns out there. So, we're feeling pretty good right now. We continue on our path of hitting our guidance that we've just issued and we feel good about our overall liquidity and balance sheet position where it stands today, but there's a lot of work to do. Dan Politzer : Understood. And then just for a follow-up, bookings are obviously positive. You're putting through all these cost efficiencies. Do you have any expectation as bookings progress and you guys continue to recover when you can get back to that $100 EBITDA per APCD level? And also, along with that, if you could just maybe give a little bit more color on the cost efficiencies, total amount, the time that they're going to be achieved? And to what extent there could be further room in coming years? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Great, that's a lot to unpack there. So, let me start with the EBITDA per capacity day. Look, this is going to take time, right? If we look at where this industry was not so long ago, we -- it was only last May of 2022 where we started operating all of our vessels. So, we are progressing. We are hitting our milestones that we've laid out for several quarters now. It is a progression. Bookings are doing well. Onboard revenue spend is trending well, but it will take time. It's not an overnight process. And so, as we think about that, part of that is enhancing our revenue, enhancing margins, obviously, and right-sizing our cost base. We've said that our strategy coming out of the pandemic was we wanted to reset the bar on pricing. We believe we've done that, which we believe will be a longer term benefit for all our constituents and now we are squarely focused on right-sizing our cost base. As we look to the future, we're on a period of transformational growth. We have almost 50% growth between now and 2028, with our scheduled pipeline of deliveries. So, we have to do better, and we are going to do better on leveraging our scale, and that's what we're focused on. So, it's going to come from a lot of different places. But we focused on the topline. Now, we're squarely focused on the cost, and that's going to translate to improved margins, which again will then translate ultimately into achieving that pre-pandemic EBITDA per capacity day. Dan Politzer : Understood. Thanks so much for all the color. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Steve Wieczynski : Yes. Hey guys. Good morning. I want to ask, Frank, this is probably for you. I want to ask about how you guys think about cutting costs versus balancing the customer experience? And I guess, what I'm getting at is, we've read out there, you guys have taken some action on board, whether that's cutting things like entertainment or servicing cabins, things like that, which I assume is being done to reduce costs. But do you worry about the customer experience that starts to be impacted and you eventually start to hurt the long-term perception of your product? Just trying to figure out how you balance those two things. Frank Del Rio : Good morning, Steve. It is a balance. Obviously, you don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, which is the customer. We believe that the -- we're trying to balance what customers pay, what they actually pay for and what they receive. So, for example, we did not cut the turndown service that you mentioned across all brands or across all cabin categories. It's only in the lower cabin categories that equate to a lower per diem. So, look, it's management's responsibility to optimize revenue and minimize costs. That's economics 101, and that's what we're doing. Mark Kempa : Steve, I think, the other way to think about it is, we're simply aligning ourselves to what others in the hospitality sector have done as well. So, this is nothing new. I think customers in today's society are used to getting a different level of service. We're not degrading the product. We're squarely focused on making sure that the guest experience is wholly intact, but we're going to align ourselves to what is the new normal for the hospitality sector. I think, it's the right thing to do. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. That makes sense. And then, second question, Mark, this is probably going to be for you, and it's kind of a quasi-accounting question, which I'm not an expert in. But we've seen you guys also -- at least, I think, I've seen you guys kind of increase your service fees or acuities by a pretty decent amount. And I would assume that some portion of that has to -- does that hit your -- half of it hits your yields and then the other half hit cost? I'm just trying to figure out, if you guys could help us think about what that impact is on that yield side? And I guess what I'm trying to get at here is, I don't want to -- I'm hoping that expectations for yields don't get too ahead of themselves, if all that kind of makes sense. Mark Kempa : Well, Steve, you're taking a big chance asking me an accounting question, but I think I'm going to go for it. Look, absolutely, when we increase the service fees, it does get rolled up as part of our gross revenue, but there's also a cost to that. And there's obviously some direct cost to that, but there's also the employment costs, which go against that, which hit in our net cruise cost. So, service fees, again, the vast majority of that, all goes to our dedicated crew and employees who are working on the ship, but there is a revenue component to it and there is a cost component to it. But, again, that's something that's been consistent for us over the years. No change in the accounting or no change in the comparability. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you for the time. Just in terms of the cost initiatives that you're talking about, can you just frame up the buckets and where you're expecting the biggest improvement and maybe like a potential upside there? And then, maybe just unpack a little bit about when it's going to hit. I would assume that a lot of it is second half weighted, but if you could just give a little bit more detail, that would be helpful. Thank you. Mark Kempa : Yes, certainly. So, on the cost, as I said in my prepared remarks, Q1 will be the highest cost quarter. And then as we look forward sequentially, we expect those costs to decrease each quarter as some of our initiatives gain hold and take place. And I think the way to think about it is as you look toward the back half of 2023, that's going to be a little bit more representative of what our exit rate would be as well on a go-forward basis. There is one thing I want to remind you as well as we are taking on a more -- we have a more pronounced mix effect with the operating capacity that we're bringing online as well. As you guys know, we are bringing on an Oceania class vessel in May of this year and a Regent vessel at the tail end of the year. Those, by default, have a much higher operating cost than the NCLH average. So, there is some impact in that overall cost guidance as a result of the mix. So, keep that in mind. And then when you think about the overall buckets on the cost, it's everything you can think of. We've said before, we spent a lot on marketing in 2022 going after the customer, creating that demand, elevating pricing. We believe we've been successful there. So, we're going to scale start scaling that back. But it's everyday things -- everything we do on our corporate side, on our ship side, whether it's optimizing our supply chain initiatives, optimizing our itineraries so that we're getting the best fuel consumption. There is no silver bullet in this industry, but it's a lot of little things that can add up and that's what we're squarely focused on going forward. Conor Cunningham : Okay. And then to follow-up maybe on pricing. There's still some -- I mean, you guys still sound great on pricing, but there's still some concerns weakening consumer overall. So, I was just curious if you could unpack your current bookings a little bit. The only reason why I ask is deployments have shifted a little bit, and I don't know if there's been something on the margin that implies weakness somewhere. So, any help there would be helpful. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Yes, this is Frank. We simply don't see any weakness. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very strong record -- new record booking levels dating back to November. And it's our view that as long as consumers have a job and the labor markets remain strong, that they'll continue spending on the things they normally spend their money on, including vacations. So, we simply don't see a weakening consumer. If you look at our forward bookings, each quarter in 2023 is better booked than the comparable quarter in 2019. And even if you start looking into 2024, it's never too early to talk about next year. 2024 bookings are running ahead at higher prices than they were at the same time in 2019 for 2020, which before the pandemic. So, we simply haven't seen any indication that the consumer is shying away from taking cruise vacations, at least not with our three brands. Conor Cunningham : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Frank Del Rio : Good morning. Mark Kempa : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Going back to some comments from last -- I believe last summer and last fall, you had talked about expectations or you seem pretty confident in record EBITDA for this year. However, when I look at the range, certainly at the midpoint and below, if I'm comparing apples-to-apples would not imply a record EBITDA. And then additionally, it looks like if I'm getting this correctly, your expectation since last earnings for bookings are now ahead, I think previously it was in line. What's changed in how you think about hitting that record EBITDA target as it relates to the guided range? And I hope that makes sense, what I just asked. Mark Kempa : Yes, we think we got it. So, Patrick, nothing has changed. I think if there's anything we've learned as a management team and society over the last year or two is that the -- we're in a unique environment. On one hand, we have a very strong consumer. We have very strong wage growth and employment. And on the other hand, we have economists telling us that we're -- there's a high chance of recession. So, you take your pick. We're -- I like into this is we're in uncharted territory in the world. So, nothing has changed. But we think by being -- we want to be conservative. We want to make sure we're hitting putting out reasonable targets, but nothing should be implied from that. We're confident of where we are, but we think a range is the most appropriate way to go at this point, given all the factors that are in front of the world as a whole. Patrick Scholes : Okay. I just have a couple of, hopefully, quick follow-up questions. Can you just explain again why you dipped into the Apollo financing? It sounded like last summer or last fall, that would not have been the intention at that time, but that's changed. Can you just review with us the rationale there? Mark Kempa : Certainly. So first and foremost, it was $250 million, which when you look at our overall debt structure, it's really minimal. But the most important reason we did that is we wanted flexibility on the facility. And as you recall and if you look in the past, we were getting -- we had six months options. We had eight-month options, 12-month options. We wanted a two-year option. And the price to do that was our counterparty wanted a small draw on the overall facility. So, when you look at the totality of that draw, which is relatively minor in the broader scope of our debt, versus having a two-year flexible backstop, we thought that was the prudent course of action to take at a relatively reasonable cost on the overall facility. Patrick Scholes : Okay. And then last one, this question actually might save Mark, you and Jessica a number of callbacks later. Just I do see your share count is going up for the full year to $460 million. Is -- I assume that's from the convert or exchangeable notes converting sometime in the year. Can you just remind us, which -- I think it's the May 2024 and August 2025 and how many if that's correct? And what -- how many shares are added from each of those, if those are the correct ones and roughly at what quarter might you expect that to occur? Mark Kempa : Yes, Patrick, I think we'll take some of those details offline on our post call. But what I can tell you is that we've been telegraphing that we expect our average fully diluted share count to be approximately about $470 million, which I think believe we have in our slide deck for a couple of calls now. And that assumes that the 2027 convertibles are converted in cash, which we've been saying from the get-go. But it really is just a reflection of where the convertibles, the 2024 and 2025 convertibles, which will be equitized. We do not have a choice there, but that is really just the accounting for it. So, on average, I would use about $460 million for the fully diluted share count for the year. Patrick Scholes : Thank you. I'll check out the slide deck on that. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Fred Wightman : Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Can you just touch on the plans or changes to the premium class? It sounds like those are going to be a little bit bigger than the first few iterations. I know that you guys were excited about offering a smaller ship size initially when that was introduced. So, what exactly changed? Was it the cost, the guest experience, something else? Harry Sommer : Yes. This is Harry Sommer. Listen, we were really excited about the performance of Prima. She's come out of the gate is our best book ship, great yields, great onboard revenue, and most importantly, great -- I guess, experience, excuse me, great satisfaction scores. When we looked at the platform now that it's in operation, we think we can take that great guest experience, great financial performance and get slightly better economies of scale by driving the ships a little bit bigger, hence, the slight increase for Prima 3 and 4, which will be delivered in 2025 and 2026. The last two is really a combination, as Mark mentioned in the prepared comments, making them methanol ready, which we think is very important for our decarbonization goals over time. We're very excited about the technology. We work with a lot of different experts in the field to hold in on ethanol being the future for ships being built in the later part of the 2020s.  But in addition to having to ship larger at the house, the methanol tanks, we're able to get more scale on those as well, more passenger counts. So again, the key is to deliver a fantastic guest experience and see what we can do to leverage scale and become more decarbonized along the way. Fred Wightman : Makes sense. And then just on the marketing spend that you guys had talked about for a while in the back half 2022, could you maybe give some qualitative feedback on whether that met your expectations? Did you get the pricing benefit that you had expected? Was the consumer feedback in line with sort of what you were hoping for when you earmark that spend or not? Frank Del Rio : Our basic go-to-market philosophy as we market to fill, we don't discount to fill throughout the pandemic period and coming out of the pandemic period. Being able to keep our industry-leading net per diems and yields was of utmost importance. We've seen what happened to others when the discounting goes too far, it takes years, if not decades to be able to climb back up that slippery hill. So, if marketing was the cost of maintaining our industry-leading yields and it was well worth it. And we turned the year in our best book position ever. Mean to be able to say that at the end of 2022, we were better booked than at any time in our history, given what this industry has just gone through, where the full fleet was not in operation until the mid-year is an incredible statement to make and at higher prices. So, yes, unquestionably, it was the right strategic decision to make for our company. Now, we believe that we've got momentum back. We had to create momentum. The industry was on its knees. We hadn't operated the full fleet in two years, zero revenue for 500 days. So, we had to stimulate the market. And you can do it one of two ways in my estimation, you can discount and you can give away the product or you can market and we choose to market. And now that we've done so and have regained momentum and bookings continue to be strong and we're better booked today than we were a year ago over 2019 at the same period. We think we can now start paring back on that marketing spend. Now at the same time, we're adding three new ships and those have to be filled. So, on a per capacity day basis, I think marketing costs will come down. On a gross basis, I'm not sure the exact number, maybe Mark knows that number. But on a PCD basis, marketing costs will come down as a result of the dynamics that just laid out. Harry Sommer : And this is Harry again. It's not just a theoretical comment. When we look at in the metric that Frank described, marketing costs divided by capacity days sold, which I think is the right metric for marketing, we've seen decreases, material decreases in Q4 versus Q3. So, we're already starting to realize that. But as Frank mentioned, we have more capacity days to sell with three new ships coming across the brands this year. Harry Sommer : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. James Hardiman : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So, I just wanted to make sure I understand sort of the trajectory on per diem. Really strong rebound here in the fourth quarter. I think we went from on a net basis from plus 5% to that 14% to 15% growth range versus 2019. I guess, as I think about the first quarter, it's going to be up 6.5% and for the year in that 9.5% range. I guess, why the detail, I'm assuming there's some mix involved here, but I know that you're launching an Oceania ship and a region ship, which I would think would be accretive to per diem. So maybe just walk us through sort of the undulations of that per diem number? Mark Kempa : James, it's Mark. So, look, I wouldn't classify anything as a deceleration. And I think when you look at our yield growth for the full year, you were spot on 9% to 10.5% pretty strong number given the value proposition of where the cruise industry vis-\u00e0-vis the broader vacation market. But when you look at Q1, you go from Q4 to Q1, it's really a mix impact of where our fleet is operating. We have a much higher weighting of exotic itineraries in Q1, which were slightly impacted on the slower restart or the slower opening of the world. So, whether it was cruises in Japan or Australia or that area of the world, there was a little bit more hurdles than we anticipated getting those back to operation, and there was a little more hesitation on the consumer. So Q1 was really just impacted by that. I would characterize it as the last normalization quarter, so to speak. But when you look beyond that and you look at our implied guidance for the remaining three quarters, I think you're seeing very strong growth there of 9% to 10% based on our guidance. So, we're feeling good where the pricing is today. James Hardiman : Okay. And just maybe a point of clarification, you talked for the fourth quarter, you talked about how revenues and net cruise costs ex-fuel or in line with your expectations with EBITDA was a bit short. What sort of was the hang up there sort of seems to point to fuel, but I thought fuel generally -- at least the spot prices seem to get better since October. So, what led to that unless on the EBITDA line? Mark Kempa : Yes, it was very slight, James. And it was really just truing up some of our year-end accruals and making sure that going into the year, we were fully stock, so to speak, to ensure that we had no lagging issues affecting our 2023 performance. So, nothing material. It was just all items on the margin. James Hardiman : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Golding with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Paul Golding : Thanks so much. My first question is around just a comment. I think Mark, you just made around the exotic destination. So, could you give us any qualitative background on how the destination mix right now compares to last year given the geopolitical disruptions last year? In other words, from just a Baltics and Eastern Med disruption last year, how the timing of these more exotic higher-yielding destinations line up to fill that gap on a year-over-year basis? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yes, certainly. So, I think when we look at the year overall, we do have more -- we are leading to a more exotic deployment mix. But that's not really concerning to us, because as we cycle through Q1 and we look toward the latter part of third quarter and fourth quarter, we see accelerating demand for those products. We do have more European capacity this year. We have slightly less Caribbean capacity and more Alaska capacity. So overall, we are trending to a, again, a bit more exotic or longer itinerary based deployments, but that's shaping up well for us, absent this what we would call a one-time Q1 anomaly with the overall restart. Paul Golding : Great. Frank Del Rio : Okay. We have time for one more question, operator. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And the final question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. I have two expense questions. One is you talked about how the exit rate by Q4 for expense would look a little bit more normalized. With the full year kind of up 18% and Q1 up 22%, does that imply the exit rate sort of going forward would still be in kind of the low to mid-teens increase versus 2019? Is that kind of what we should think of as sort of a normalized run rate for you? And then my other expense question is on the $1.3 billion in higher newbuild CapEx. And I know you talked about upsizing a number of the Prima ships and adding some alternative fuel to two of them. It seems like maybe there are some other things contributing to that $1.3 billion than just those additional bursts and alternative fuel just based on the numbers, it seems like there may be other things in the higher new build CapEx number? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Hi, Robin, I'll take that. I think there was two questions in there. So, I'll start with the last one because that's the one I can remember. Regarding newbuild, look, the -- we're increasing the size of four vessels pretty significantly by, I think, it's more than 10% on three and four and almost more than 20%. So, there is a cost to that. There's -- it's not just adding cabins, it's lengthening the vessels, widening the vessels, but also more importantly, on five and six, we are getting them -- those vessels to be methanol ready. I always say, going green is not free. There is a cost to it, but we think this is a good cost. We think it's the right cost. I would hesitate or caution you to just simply take the additional burst and look at it as costing $1.2 billion, because there is a lot of technical aspects behind that in relation to making the vessels bigger. So, I would just caution you on that note. And I think the -- your first part of the question was on the exit rate of our costs. I think you're thinking about it correctly, somewhere in the low teens is probably where we would look vis-\u00e0-vis 2019, but again, we are squarely focused on. We have to do a better job of leveraging our scale. And I think as we continue to prove that quarter-after-quarter this year, you're going to see improvements on that front. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks very much. Frank Del Rio : As always, thank you, everyone, for your time and support today. We will be available to answer any of your questions throughout the day and we wish you a good day, and please stay safe. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Paul and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions for the session will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Harry Sommer, President and CEO-Elect of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2023 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank? Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today marks a significant milestone for me as it is my 34th and final earnings call as President and CEO of this incredible company before my upcoming retirement, which was announced just over a month ago. In 2015, I was given the opportunity to lead Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings into its next chapter, one where we brought together three of the industry's leading brands : Norwegian Cruise Lines, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises to form the best cruise operator in the industry. After eight incredible years, it is now time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders who are ready and energized to take this company onto greater heights. Before getting to the crux of the call, I want to take a moment to thank all of Norwegian's team members around the globe, shipboard and shoreside, who are the backbone of this company and who are the main driver of its success. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our loyal guests, value travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors, analysts and all of our stakeholders for your continued support and partnership over the years. I'm incredibly proud of what we have been able to collectively achieve, especially over the past few extremely challenging years, but I know that the best days for this company still lie ahead and I look forward to seeing what you all accomplish together. With Harry Sommer at the helm, I leave this company in the most capable of hands. As Slide 5 shows, Harry has a broad range and depth of experience that makes him one of the premier executives in the industry. I have worked with Harry in various capacities over the course of three decades, and I can assure you that he is a strategic and innovative leader who has the right talent, skill set and energy to lead the company at this typical time in his history. As a longstanding cruise industry and company veteran, he brings both continuity and a fresh perspective to this seat. We have been working together along with our Board of Directors and the rest of the senior management team for some time now to ensure a seamless transition and I am confident that NCLH will not skip a beat as we continue to push forward and capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing today. Now there are times when fate meets circumstances, and this happens to be one of those times, as my departure coincides not only with the 20th anniversary of the founding of Oceania Cruises, but also the delivery of the seventh ship in the Oceania fleet, the incomparable Vista, which you can see details about on Slide 6. With great pride, we took delivery of this amazing ship just last week, bringing NCLH's total fleet to 30 vessels with over 60,000 berths. We are heading over to Europe this week where Vista will be christened in Malta by her godmother, Emmy Award-winning food personality Giada De Laurentiis. At 1,200 guests, Vista is the first of two Allura Class ships for the line, with the second ship named Allura expected in 2025. These ships will further elevate and cement Oceania Cruises' leading position in the upper premium cruise space. I have to thank our partners at Fincantieri once again, who are bringing our vision to life and delivering a truly magnificent ship. What is even more exciting is that Vista is just a first of three newbuilds that we have in the pipeline this year with Norwegian Viva and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur joining the fleet later this year. New hardware introductions generate excitement from those new-to-cruise and new-to-brand as well as with our loyal past guests, so three ships in one year will mean that much more of a halo effect for our company to leverage. Given their very efficient financing structure, it's made possible through the unique nature of the industry's interconnected financing ecosystem, new ships are able to contribute immediately and are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. So now I'll turn the call over to Harry, who will be tasked with delivering on the significant potential upside we see ahead, to provide an update on the current environment and the key catalysts we have on the horizon. Harry? Harry Sommer : Thank you, Frank. And before I get started, I have to say that I'm honored and grateful to be given the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Growing up with immigrant working-class parents in the Bronx, I could never have dreamed to be at the helm of such a storied brand. But Frank, you took me under your wings early in my career and had taught me so much over the last three decades. I know I speak on behalf of the entire NCLH team when I say, thank you Frank for your countless contributions not only to our company but also to the broader cruise industry. I look forward to building on this remarkable legacy and I am committed to doing everything I can to best position this company for continued success. Over the next few months, I'll be speaking with travel partners, team members, destination representatives, the investment community, and a whole host of constituents, while working closely with our executive team to finetune our plan and vision for the future, and I look forward to sharing details with you. Shifting our attention to the backdrop that makes me so optimistic for what lies ahead. Slide 7 outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we see now and on the horizon. We covered our leadership transition already, which could not have gone smoother, so I will skip ahead to what continues to be a healthy demand environment. Our target consumer remains resilient with a persistent desire for travel and experiences. Our booking window, which is our best forward-looking indicator, remains strong. In fact, we were encouraged to see that even with the banking sector-driven financial market volatility in March, we did not experience any unusual booking or cancellation activity across any of our brands. Our onboard revenue generation, which is our best real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially, is also performing exceptionally well, and we are even more pleased with the depth and breadth of the strength across revenue streams, ships and regions. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was nearly 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. This is driven in part by our focus on attracting the best guests and enhancing our market-leading bundled offering. We are also increasing quality touchpoints with our guests, starting with the time of booking, to capture even more revenue and pre-payment prior to cruise. Our pre-sold revenue on a per passenger day basis for the first quarter of 2023 is approximately double the level in 2019, an important contributor to our onboard revenue strength, as guests who make pre-cruise purchases tend to spend significantly more than guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. Turning to our next catalyst. We continue to take strategic actions across our business to improve operating efficiencies and right-size our cost base to rebuild and enhance margins. The results of this initiative are already beginning to bear fruit as demonstrated by our first quarter adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day which was not only 14% below the run rate in the second half of 2022, but also outperformed our guidance by $4, as certain savings were realized earlier than anticipated. We expect this metric to continue to show modest sequential improvement each quarter for the remainder of 2023, as seen on Slide 8. I want to stress that we recognize and acknowledge, while this is a great start, we still have more work to do. This initiative is very much ongoing and will continue to be a top priority under my leadership. We are committed to identifying and evaluating incremental opportunities across every area of the business, help accelerate our margin recovery. This does not mean, however, that we will not continue to invest in our product or service offering to enhance our guest experience, but rather that we will be even more strategic and data-driven when making these decisions to ensure we are investing where we see the highest returns and most impact. A good example of this is our recent announcement regarding the rollout of the Starlink low-latency broadband internet system in a phased manner across our fleet. This is a strategic and cost-effective initiative to help address the consistent pain point we hear from guests regarding the reliability and speed of Internet connectivity at sea. This is one example of our focus on finding the right balance, which is critical to keeping our brands' value propositions intact, maintain our incredibly loyal past guest base, and continually attract new cruisers to sail on our world-class fleet from what we believe is the best vacation experience in the world. The last catalyst to highlight is our industry-leading newbuild pipeline shown on Slide 9, which Frank already touched on briefly. Capacity growth in 2023 is expected to be just shy of 20% compared to 2019 as we add over 5,000 berths to our world-class fleet. And as we look out over the next five years, this increases to approximately 50% growth versus 2019. All three of our brands are well-poised to profitably absorb this elevated capacity growth given our relative size and under-penetration in many markets around the world. We are focused on better leveraging our scale as we embark on this period of transformational growth and translating this capacity growth into outside benefit to both the top- and bottom-line. This makes for an attractive entry point for investors as the newbuild pipeline adds significant potential future earnings power compared to today's levels. When combined with our ongoing efforts to maximize profitability on our existing fleet, including by delivering consistent year-over-year moderate yield growth, we view this as a winning formula. Shifting our discussion now to our booking demand and pricing trends. You can see on Slide 10, we reached load factors of 101.5% in the first quarter, exceeding our guidance and breaking triple-digit levels for the first time in three years with some voyages exceeding occupancy above 115%. With this significant achievement, we have also nearly closed the occupancy gap versus 2019 levels. In the second quarter, we expect to average 105% occupancy, a return to normalized levels with cabins fully sold. This average is slightly below 2019 levels as a result of our strategic shift to longer, more immersive itinerary at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand, naturally resulting in less thirds and fourths, which is what historically pushes passenger occupancy above the 100% mark, all while enhancing margin over time. Turning to Slide 11. After a very strong wave season, our cumulative book position for the balance of 2023 remains ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices. Demand and pricing continues to be strong, not only for 2023, but also as we look further out the sailings in 2024 and beyond. To give you an example, bookings for Regent's 2026 World Cruise were nearly 70% higher than its 2022 World Cruise, which was the last World Cruise launched pre-pandemic, and at an average price point of over $230,000 per suite. Another strong indicator that our product continues to resonate with our guests is the performance of NCL's CruiseNext program, an onboard program in which we sell non-refundable future cruise certificates. In the first quarter, CruiseNext achieved its highest quarterly result in the program's history, surpassing the previous record. As we look through the remainder of the year, our substantial book position coupled with the continued healthy demand metrics we are experiencing gives us confidence in achieving our 2023 net per diem, a net yield guidance, which Mark will touch on in more detail momentarily. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to provide an update on our decarbonization efforts as part of our global sustainability program Sail & Sustain, something that I'm very passionate about and committed to advancing. As shown on Slide 12, coinciding with Earth Day last week, we announced new short- and near-term greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction targets to help guide us on our pursuit of net zero by 2050. We are targeting a 10% reduction in GHG intensity by 2026 and 25% by 2030. The scope of these targets cover our direct emission as well as the full well-to-wake impact of our fuel consumption. As we execute on this plan, we expect to see a dual benefit of not only initial reductions, but also cost savings from reduced fuel consumption. We also revamped our climate action strategy, which is now centered on three key pillars : efficiency, innovation and collaboration. We are implementing solutions for efficiency today, innovating for future solutions, including with our investments in modifying two of our future newbuilds to create Methanol-Ready configurations, and are committed to collaborating with our stakeholders and partners along the way. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financial results and outlook, I want to also thank Frank for all that he has done to propel this company forward as well as his outstanding leadership. I look forward to continuing to partner with Harry in his new role as we work to capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing in order to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. My commentary today will focus on our first quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics is on a constant currency basis. Slide 13 highlights our first quarter results, in which we are pleased to report that we met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top-line, total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter was up approximately 18% versus 2019. Net per diems increased approximately 7.7%, achieving the high end of guidance, while net yield of 3.6% with a healthy beat versus our expectations, as load factor of 101.5% came in well ahead of projections. With significantly higher participation as a result of enhancements to our bundled offerings today when compared to '19, the accounting allocation between ticket and onboard revenue has also changed, which can skew the comparison. Therefore, we focus on total net per diem and net yield as a better holistic representation of our pricing power. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day averaged $161 in the quarter, better than expected and approximately 14% lower than the run rate in the second half of 2022. This reflects the rapid execution of cost saving initiatives identified and implemented last year, some of which were realized earlier than anticipated. This includes improvements in areas such as supply chain initiatives, back office optimization, as well as crew costs and travel expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $40 million higher than our guidance and approximately $234 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS loss of $0.30, also beat our guidance. Shifting our attention to guidance. Our outlook for the second quarter can be found on Slide 14. As we have stated previously, the second quarter will complete our occupancy ramp up. In addition, comparisons to 2019 includes certain premium-priced Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year, which we did not operate in 2023. As a result, growth is in line with our expectations with net per diem increasing approximately 5.50% to 6.25% and net yield expected to increase approximately 2.50% to 3.25%. Pricing and yield are both expected to increase in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter exhibiting the strongest growth versus 2019. This is driven by our organic pricing power and, in part, by a favorable comp as the second half of 2019 included various headwinds like the rapid exit from Cuba and the close and resale of those sailings. Fourth quarter is also expected to benefit from our strategic shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and European seasons this year, as well as a mix shift with more capacity operating for our Regent and Oceania brands. Given our robust book position for the second half of 2023, which is ahead of 2019, we have good visibility into the balance of the year, which gives us confidence that we can achieve the sequential improvement and year-over-year growth. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $159 in the second quarter, a further improvement versus the prior quarter, as additional savings initiatives are realized. We continue to expect modest sequential improvement each quarter in 2023, as occupancy increases and as a result of initiatives which have already been identified and implemented. This should result in a lower run rate cost level exiting 2023 than our full year reported results. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $485 million, which is roughly the same level as EBITDA in the same quarter of 2019, another stepping stone to closing the gap versus pre-pandemic levels. I'm also pleased to report that we expect to achieve another significant milestone in the quarter with adjusted EPS turning positive for the first time since the pandemic at approximately $0.25 per share. Now shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion, with the high end of our targeted range representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.75 or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the first quarter outperformance, partially offset by higher anticipated fuel costs and FX for the remainder of the year. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, net per diem growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019, and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance. Moving on to costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year, slightly better than our prior guidance and reflecting lower-than-expected costs in the first quarter. This represents a 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. As Harry noted, we continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies, and are taking deliberate actions to improve our margins, while maintaining the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels our brands are known for. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate this improvement over the coming quarters. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Slide 15 provides our debt maturity profile, which includes approximately $800 million of scheduled debt service for the remainder of the year, the vast majority of which is related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. We've talked previously about the actions taken earlier this year to address a large portion of our 2024 maturities, so I won't go into further details today, but a summary is provided on Slide 16 for your reference. Since we last spoke, we also signed agreements to increase our ECA-backed commitments by approximately \u20ac1.7 billion. This was primarily to finance improvements and modifications to newbuilds currently on order across our three brands. This includes the previously communicated changes to the last four Prima Class ships to make them up to 20% larger than the first-generation ships, as well as the addition of the Methanol-Ready configuration to the last two ships to increase optionality and help future-proof these long-life assets and reach our decarbonization goals. The financing also covers owner supplies associated with preparing certain newbuild center service as well as related financing premiums. While we originally plan to fund this with our organic cash flow generation when the ships were originally ordered, given the very efficient and supportive financing we received from export credit agencies and the continued uncertainty in the macro and financial markets, we felt financing this was a prudent action to minimize cash outflows for the next few years. Turning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remained strong at approximately $1.9 billion, as outlined on Slide 17. This consists of approximately $700 million of cash and cash equivalents, nearly $600 million of availability under our revolver and our $650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate $300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity but is not currently available to drop. I want to reiterate our commitment and relentless focus on delivering value for all of our key stakeholders. We will continually evaluate options to accelerate our recovery, while maintaining adequate financial flexibility to adapt to different macroeconomic backdrops. Overall, we feel optimistic about the direction of our business and we believe we are taking the right steps today to create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments. Frank Del Rio : Thank you, Mark. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 18. First, we continue to see healthy and resilient demand from our target markets who remain willing and eager to spend on cruise vacation travel. Our brands continue to resonate with consumers as demonstrated by our book position and pricing for the remainder of '23. Our record book position also gives us high visibility into the back half of the year and beyond. Second, we are already starting to see the benefits of our margin enhancement efforts, and we'll continue to take strategic measures to best position the company for its next chapter, while ensuring that we keep the secret sauce that makes our brand so special fully intact. Third, we are excited to deliver on our industry-leading growth profile, which we are confident we can profitably absorb providing a meaningful boost to our future earnings power. And lastly, we feel comfortable with our liquidity position and are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet in the coming years. We've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Frank. [Operator Instructions] Jessica John : Before we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address a top question from our online shareholder Q&A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and upload questions for management. The top voted question we received this quarter was, what are the three main action points the company will take to ensure growth in the year ahead? Harry, do you want to take that one? Harry Sommer : Sure, yes. Happy to, and that's a great question. We touched on this already in our prepared remarks, but we are laser focused on delivering our '23 guidance and financial goals. One of the drivers of growth this year is going to be our robust newbuild platform with us taking delivery of three new and I might be biased, but I'm going to add absolutely magnificent ships this year, including the incredible Vista, which start sailing tomorrow. Those ships along with some of our other recent additions translate to a nearly 20% growth in capacity when compared to 2019. So that's expected to provide a meaningful boost to our current and future earnings power. We're also hard at work at our ongoing margin enhancement initiative and our continuing to identify new and innovative ways to get more efficient while also delivering best-in-class product and service offerings for our guests. We're pleased with the results so far, but we're not stopping there and we'll continue to leave no stone unturned. And lastly, we're going to continue to capitalize on the robust consumer demand we're experiencing, which is translating into our record book position and strong pricing, including very robust onboard revenue generation. So, we feel good about our position over the next year and we're going to do everything in our power to deliver on all our goals. Jessica John : Hey, operator, we can take the questions from the line now. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dan Politzer : Hey, good morning, everyone. And Frank, congrats on a storied career and wish you all the best luck in your future endeavors. Harry, congrats on the new role and look forward to getting to know you better. First question on the second quarter, the yields. I mean, I think they were a little bit lower than we were expecting. So just any more detail there between maybe the gross and the net, was there any noise in the quarter on the Free at Sea program, also I guess that would relate to the first quarter? But just trying to zoom in a little bit on first quarter versus second quarter and the change there? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yes, good morning, Dan. This is Mark. So, first and foremost, there is no change. Q2 -- both Q2 pricing and yields are exactly in line with where we thought they were going to be. Of course, as your occupancy ramps up, you do see a little bit less of pricing power on your [lower meta] (ph) i.e., inside cabins. But overall our NPDs remain very healthy and strong. And then secondly, I think the other piece to look at is when you do the comparison versus a very strong second quarter 2019, we're comping over some difficult comps with Cuba that we had back in 2019 as well as the full benefit of Baltic itinerary. So, while on the surface, it may appear that there is -- it is a bit softer than Q1, I assure you it is exactly where we expect it to be. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the second half of 2023 is expected and continue -- and we continue to expect very strong pricing and yield growth. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then, on the cost side, the cost guidance, obviously, the first quarter was better. I guess to what extent should we expect that to continue to step down throughout the year? And how much is your guidance reflecting some conservatism there? I know that was a big part of the commentary last quarter just on the uncertain macro. Mark Kempa : Yes, sure. So, let's address the cost side first. So, we did overachieve in Q1. And as I had communicated, we had communicated on our last call, we were steadfastly going into a lot of our onboard -- our margin enhancement initiatives. And we simply executed some of those initiatives quicker than we had anticipated. So, while we did get a benefit in Q1, it doesn't necessarily translate to a benefit in the outer quarters simply because we already had that baked into our guidance. That said, we have not stopped, and we continue to look at opportunities to improve our cost structure. So -- but it's a bit early for us to give additional color on that. All I can tell you is that we are razor focused on that. And I think we will continue to have a sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter, and I think I'm very confident. I think quite a bit of you were nervous last quarter whether or not we could achieve our cost savings, and I think we've demonstrated that in Q1. We've demonstrated that in our full year updated guidance, and we will continue to push hard on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, guys, good morning. Harry, welcome. Frank, thank you for your service. Good luck in retirement. Hope you take up some golf now. So, I'm going to kind of ask Dan's question maybe a little bit differently. But if -- Mark, if we look at Slide 13, I mean look you basically destroyed every guidance target that you laid out back in February for the first quarter. So, we think about that beat and the fact that you didn't really flow that through, that full beat through to your full year EBITDA guidance And look, I understand there's a fuel headwind there, but I guess what I'm just getting at here is if your customer base stays pretty much status quo from here, it would seem to us it would be tough not to get to the high end of your full year guidance and maybe even exceed that top end of your guidance. So, what am I missing there, Mark? Mark Kempa : Well, Steve, first of all, I appreciate the adjective you used of destroyed our guidance. But I would like to say we healthily beat our guidance. Look, Steve, I think first and foremost, we have to look at the underlying fundamentals of the business. Our NPD and yields continue to be strong, continue to be in line with our expectations The consumer is still strong. The consumer is buying cruise tickets. The consumer is spending more on board. The consumer is pre buying more before they get on board. And we're very pleased with that. So -- but if you just took Q1 in isolation and you said, okay, we beat the quarter by $0.15, and you look at the rest of the year, almost half of that is being eroded by fuel and FX headwinds. So, the remainder of it, we are carrying through. So, while we're not ready to necessarily change the rest of our guidance metrics, I think we're trending well and we're trending healthy. And I think our guidance reflects that. So, we said last quarter that we wanted to be prudent in terms of our guidance. We want to deliver and hopefully beat. We'll continue down that path. But things are looking very, very healthy from our perspective in terms of the overall consumer demand for cruise. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, got you. Thanks for that, Mark. And then, Mark, probably for you as well. If we go back to your initial guidance back in February, you noted that you turned the year. I think it was around 62% booked, which was in your historical range. And now as we've eventually exited wave, can you maybe help us think about where you are booked now for '23 and then maybe also kind of give us a look at '24? And if you don't want to give exact numbers, I understand that, but maybe some qualitative commentary would be helpful there. Harry Sommer : Sure, I'll take that one. And Steve, I thank you for the kind words at the initial start of your question. We've stated before that our goal is to be between 60% and 65% booked at year-end for the following 12 months. I think that range applies to the end of wave as well that we like to be between 60% to 65% booked for the following 12 months at the end of wave. And I can say that we are hardly within that range, pretty much exactly where we want to be. So, we were very happy with the way wave turned out and our book position both on a basis of itself and compared to 2019 is doing very well. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Harry. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Frank. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig a little bit more into the regional setup. Can you discuss what you're seeing? I think first half of the year you weighed a little heavier at Caribbean. How pricing and close-in demand is looking for the region? And now that you've kind of moved through waves and have more of Alaska and Europe for this summer filled out, kind of talk about how you're feeling about pricing for the summer? Harry Sommer : Sure, Vince. I'll -- it's Harry. I'll take that one too. Listen, we were very pleased with the results in Q1. We're trying with our new premium itineraries to be us booked a little further in advance so that close-in bookings does not represent a -- such as larger percentage of our overall business as it used to. That being said, we were very pleasantly surprised with close-in demand for Caribbean in Q1. Of course, Caribbean doesn't matter all that much for us in Q2 and beyond as we shift our deployment to Europe and Alaska. So, a little less close-in demand there as we are booked further in advance, but we're happy with both occupancy and price, especially for the key summer period. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. And any color just on the cadence of bookings that you've seen year-to-date maybe relative to pre-COVID levels? I think that there was kind of the wave of pent-up demand following some change in COVID restrictions at the mid to late part of last year. Obviously, it sounds like wave has been healthy. But would you say things are stable, accelerating or decelerating kind of on a core basis when you adjust for those factors? Harry Sommer : Look, we have about a 20% increase in capacity for 2023 versus 2019. So of course, our bookings need to be 20% higher. And we've absolutely seen or exceeded those levels during Q1 booking period compared to Q1 of 2019. So, I think the best indicator for us is our advanced passenger ticket sale revenue. Our balance sheet is up I think 60% compared to the end of Q1 2019, which I think gives you a very robust indicator of how our book position looks. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandt Montour : Hey, good morning, everybody, and congratulations to both Frank and Harry. So, first question is on the cost side. Mark, you sort of gave us a quick update and sort of sequential improvement on a dollar basis throughout the year. And I'm just trying to -- and obviously, if we try and back into what's implied for the full year, it would seem like it's very modest improvement, almost flattish from a pretty high level. And I'm just trying to reconcile that with the seasonality that we used to see in your business with the 3Q costs usually being pretty elevated given more exotic itineraries. Can you kind of help us understand why that's different now? Mark Kempa : Yes, Brandt, good morning. So, I think what you have to think about is looking at our newbuild deliveries that we're taking this year as well. So, we are taking deliveries of ships obviously now in the second quarter. We'll be taking delivery of a ship in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And what's unique about that in the third and fourth quarter obviously we're taking -- we have a higher -- we have the higher operating cost brands of Oceania and Regent. So that does somewhat elevate your unit cost although we do receive benefit on both the top- and bottom-lines from that. So, I wouldn't skew too much that the premium itineraries are going to be a big driver of costs. Overall, our cost levels tend to remain the same. It's really around our promotions and advertising variable costs that would have any sort of influence. So look, I think bottom-line, we continue to sequentially improve our cost structure. I said last quarter, we need to do a better job of leveraging our scale. We're on that journey. We've hopefully demonstrated confidence to the market that we've achieve step one of that, and we'll continue to optimize around that. And hopefully, over the next few quarters, we can continue to prove that and further build confidence that we're leveraging our scale to the best of our ability. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up. Great to hear that you guys are happy with your book for the all important sort of summer in the Mediterranean. I'm just curious if flight prices broadly is acting as a headwind, and if you think about your book or your strategy this year for the summer, is it bundle -- is flight prices being bundled in for the consumer? Is that sort of more -- is that more of a factor now than it was in '19? And how should we think about that? Mark Kempa : Yes, Brandt, I think you've hit it, right? We've all experienced whether it's traveling for business or consumers traveling, flight prices are elevated. And of course, with our bundling strategy that we've embarked on over the last few years and that's really taking full throttle in 2023, that does have some headwinds to our overall net yield. And that's simply as a matter of when we sell the ticket to the consumer, we sell the air at what we believe are going to be the best projected prices. And our consumers are booking very far out in advance, which is a good thing. So there's always going to be some puts and takes until when you actually purchase the flight where you may have some variability in there. But overall, we believe that our air strategy is the right thing to do given our strategic itinerary deployment. And there's always going to be some variability in there, but nothing that overly concerns us. Harry Sommer : I just want to add to Mark's comment that our guests have to fly to get to a cruise. And there's two choices, they either make their own air arrangements or they make their air arrangements through us. And of course, as we buy air tickets for over 1 million guests a year, we have some really good systems and efficiencies to leverage the best prices out there. We use all types of tools in terms of automation, even AI to predict when the best time to book a flight is. And with those tools, we think bundling actually provides us in this uncertain future environment, a competitive advantage. So something that absolutely it impacts us. But if we do it right, we can turn it to our benefit. Brandt Montour : That's great color. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you for the time. Congrats, Frank and Harry. Just on the second half, net per diem, it's implied a decent step up in the second half. Just trying to get comfortable with how you get there. So are you basically booked above that right now? And then as you get closer in, the trends kind of soften a little bit? And just any color on how you're expecting onboard trends in the second half would be helpful. Thank you. Mark Kempa : Yes. So, regarding our second half NPDs, yes, I think we labeled that on our slide, we're expecting roughly 11% or 12%, if I recall correctly. And number one, that's on the back of very strong just good old-fashioned core growth. It's also on the back of bringing on some of our premium brand vessels. But more importantly, when you look at the comparisons in the back half of 2019, we're rolling over much easier comparisons, the inverse of what's happening in the first half versus 2019. Again, we had to rapidly exit Cuba in, I believe, June or July of 2019. And we had to sell those voyages close in for very efficient pricing. And then, of course, as you look at the brand mix, that's also a tailwind. But also in Q4, where we expect quite a substantial amount of our pricing power, we are actually in the Alaska season longer this year as well as in the European season longer this year. And I think it's somewhere in the neighborhood of we have 3% more deployment in Q4 of Alaska and I believe 7% deployment -- more deployment in Europe for Q4. So, when you combine all those factors together, that's what gives good -- great confidence in where our pricing is. And I think the tail end of your question was whether or not we're booked there currently, look, we're -- our book position, Harry touched on it earlier, we're exactly where we need to be to hit our goals and our guidance. So, I won't give too much color on that, but other than we're exactly in a position we need -- where we need to be. Conor Cunningham : Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the shift to longer cruises and more immersive cruise, the 3 point gap in overall occupancy, is that basically reflective of that change in the second quarter? And then, I'm just trying to figure out the limits to rebuild an occupancy in the 2024 assuming no change to your footprint overall? Thank you. Harry Sommer : So, in terms of 2024, I'll take the second part of your question first, listen, I think there's still a little rebuilding that can be done in Q1. So, I think Q2 to Q4 basically represents what we're going to see in future periods as well. But Q1 finished up at 101.5%, we can do better than that going forward when we have the more advanced lead time we need to book some of our exotic itineraries and also have the fully overhang of the difficult years that we've talked about beforehand. In terms of this gap of 3%, does that reflect what we're going forward? Pretty much close to that after the Q1 commentary I gave you already. We think this shift to premium itineraries, primarily Europe and Alaska, but a little bit in Asia as well, allows us to get the type of customer that we need to get to support our revenue goals and our revenue growth for the future. Conor Cunningham : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Grambling : Good morning. Thanks. Harry, congrats on the new role and Frank, best wishes in retirement. I have a sneaking suspicion you have contributed to the stellar booking and pricing coming around the world sailing. Following up on the strategic shift to longer, more immersive itineraries, should we be thinking about any other financial ramifications of this shift other than the occupancy? I mean, is there any net cruise, cost changes or net yield changes that we should be thinking through? Thanks. Harry Sommer : I just want to comment that when Frank goes on cruises in retirement, he doesn't pay, so he won't be activity to that world cruise number you saw earlier. So, I'll turn it over to Mark to talk about financial ramifications. Mark Kempa : Hi, Steve. So, I would actually rephrase that as financial benefits. Obviously, while there is a slight impact to load factor, the whole reason we're going to more longer-premium itinerary intensive destinations is number one, to get a better guest, to get higher pricing and to maximize the value that we're getting out of each of our assets. So while there's always a -- both sides of the coin, overall, the economics on going to those itineraries obviously favors the company or we would not be doing that. But so I wouldn't get caught up too much on the slight impact to occupancy. Stephen Grambling : Got it. That's helpful. And then changing gears a little bit, can you just remind us of how much of your new ship spend is already financed and locked in as we think about rates? And have you seen any impact to export credit rates given the broader credit crunch? Mark Kempa : So, all of our new build orders, I'll remind everybody that we do not execute any newbuild orders without committed financing. That is just a complete no-no in our organization. So, we have very efficient fixed rate financing for all of our newbuilds that are on schedule to delivery through 2028 at an average rate of anywhere from 2% to 2.5%. There is no opportunity for the export credit agencies to change those rates. As I said those are fixed. So we have very efficient financing going forward, and I see no risk around that because there's just simply not an opportunity for the institutions to do that. Stephen Grambling : That's great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. And congratulations to Frank and Harry to both of you with the changes. I had a question. If we could circle back just for a moment to the occupancy in Q2. A quarter ago you talked about it returning to historic occupancy levels. And you're talking today about some of the shoulder period itineraries are being expanded. And so, was the change since reported was it just sort of a decision to say, \"Hey, we're happy with the pricing that we're getting and so we're going to -- occupancy may not be coming in exactly what we thought, but it makes more sense to hold price for those,\" or just trying to think about -- because I think the itineraries themselves didn't change since you last reported. So just kind of wondering if it was -- what it was in the yield management that approach had changed. And then my other question is just on the \u20ac1.7 billion in additional ECA financing, I know the \u20ac1.2 billion are for those ships that are a couple of years out. Is the additional \u20ac500 million, is that for 2023 specifically or is that spread out over different years? Harry Sommer : So, Robin, this is Harry. I'll take the first half, and I'll let Mark discuss the ECA financing. Listen, in Q2 -- in all future quarters, our focus now is in having our cabins as close to 100% full as palpable. So, I can definitively say that in Q2, we will be at or ahead of our Q2 cabin load occupancy across the entire fleet to get the passenger load occupancy as a function of, what we talked before, having less third and fourth guests on board. But as Mark just discussed, we believe, over time, this actually is going to be EBITDA and margin accretive. So, we're very happy with that strategy. Mark Kempa : Yes. And Robin, just to add to that, we did try to communicate last quarter and over the course of many investor meetings that when we said historical occupancies, we didn't say that they were going to be exactly the same. We said we expected them to be within a couple of points, especially on the overall year run rate. So, I just want to point out that that's not necessarily a change from last quarter. In terms of the export credit agency financing, yes, so we obtained financing for \u20ac1.7 billion. And in our last earnings release, we had called out that we had increased our contractual commitments by \u20ac1.2 billion. And the differential simply is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've now included certain things, financing for owner supply and other related items that are required as part of the ship delivery. And the thought process there was it is very efficient and very extremely beneficial financing. So, in order to preserve cash for the long term at very -- and given the very efficient rates, we simply decided to finance more. So does not represent a further \u20ac0.5 billion increase in the overall ship cost, it is simply a different mechanism for financing some of the existing costs that were already expected. And I think that's why when you look at our capital commitments on our newbuilds for the next three years, it's actually decreased overall in terms of cash out of the system. Robin Farley : I know it's definitely favorable terms and the fact that they're willing to finance the -- that additional \u20ac500 million absolutely a positive. I was just wondering if that \u20ac500 million was for 2023 or is that for the later deliveries that the \u20ac1.2 billion applies to, or is it spread out over a number of deliveries between them? Mark Kempa : It's really spread out over the course of the next three to five -- it's spread out I don't want to say ratably, but relatively ratably across all of the remaining newbuilds, excluding Norwegian Viva and Vista, which we just took delivery of, of course. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Paul, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Scholes : Great. Thank you. Frank, well, congratulations on absolutely an amazing career. And Harry, welcome to the hot seat, as they say. My questions are for Mark. The last time we spoke regarding the debt maturity, the intention was to use cash flow from operations this year to pay off the ECA -- the existing ECA loans. And then secondly, if I have my notes correctly for the $1.4 billion loan, it's going to be either pushed out or amend and extended. Is that still the intention? And did I get that correct? Thank you. Mark Kempa : Hi, Patrick. Good morning. Yes. So, definitely we are planning -- we are funding all of our existing debt maturities this year from cash on hand and organic cash flow. So, you're spot on there. And then, the $1.4 billion of term loan and revolver that was extended to January 2025, we will address that -- start addressing that later this year. And whether or not we refinanced that on a more holistic approach or we do another amend and extend. Obviously, we'll look at what the markets are doing, what the environment looks like. But we'll do the most -- obviously, the most economically feasible option out there. So that's something that you'll see us out in the marketplace in the latter part of this year. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. And then just a related follow-up question. Mark, over the past year, you've given some longer-term net debt to EBITDA target ratios for various years. Are you still -- do you see yourself still on track to hit those targets? Thank you. Mark Kempa : Yes, Patrick. We're firing on all cylinders. As I've said internally, our target is to turn 2023 with a very five -- high five handle on a pro forma run rate leverage basis. Now that's not a necessarily easy task, but that's one of the things we're marching to as the management team and, of course, with our Board of Directors. And that's going to come on the back of again strong pricing and yield growth, which we've talked about, as well as rightsizing our cost base and leveraging our scale. So, we are marching towards that. There's never a guarantee, but that is what we're rallying around. And we hope to deliver on that and we're feeling good with what the outlook looks like today. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Great. Thank you. Frank Del Rio : Well, ladies and gentlemen, once again, I want to thank everyone on this call. Whether you're a travel partner, a vendor, a lender or an analyst, you've supported us, you've challenged us, but most of all, you've made us better. Personally, I couldn't have asked for a more fulfilling and more successful career in this incredible industry and everyone here contributed to that. Now for one last time, thank you for your interest and your support. I have full confidence in the management team and their ability to take this company onto its next chapter. Harry, Mark and Jessica and the team will be available to answer any questions you may have once this call is over. Have a great day, stay safe, and all the best. Thank you once again. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maria, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, all participants of this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2023 Earnings and Business Update Call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.  Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2023 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry? Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us here today. So today marks exactly 1 month since I began my new role as President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. I'm humbled and honored to have been trusted to lead this incredible company, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities I see at. The responsibility they have to our best network of stakeholders, including our 40,000 team members worldwide, our guests our travel adviser partners, suppliers, lenders, shipyards, the over 700 communities we visit and all of you in the investment community is not something I take likely. Rest assured, my leadership team, the Board of Directors and I are committed to best positioning Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings for success. My focus now is squarely on the future and how we can refine and enhance our strategy to optimize our existing fleet of high-quality assets, further differentiate our business model, build resiliency, advance our efforts to drive a positive impact on society in the environment and ultimately drive more value to our shareholders and broader stakeholders.  With new leadership not only in my seat, but in all 3 of our award-winning brands and most recently for our vessel operation function, there is a possible feeling of reinvigoration and excitement about the future across the entire company. We are approaching every decision with fresh perspective and new energy, challenging the status quo at every level and encouraging our entire team to think outside of the box and come to the table with new ideas, however big or small. Along with these changes, you can see for yourself on Slide 5 that while many of the senior leaders are new to their roles, there is still continuity and extensive experience among all of the leaders allowing for smooth transition without skipping a beat. Our executive team has an average of over 20 years in the cruise industry and nearly all has been with NCLH for a decade plus. I have the unlost confidence that this team is the right one to take the company to even greater heights. As we are fine-tuning our longer-term strategic vision and priorities, we are also focused on execution today, and Slide 6 outlines my near-term priorities.  First, we are focused on capitalizing on the healthy demand environment for cruise, which I will talk about in more detail a little later in my commentary. At a high level, this means remaining within a booked position of approximately 60% to 65% on a 12-month forward basis while increasing pricing and maximizing onboard revenue generation. After years of experience, we believe this level will be the sweet spot based on our current deployment mix, and I am pleased to say we are comfortably in this range today. Our revenue management process is dynamic and we carefully monitor on a granular level how each ship itineranvoyage is tracking against its optimal booking curve and adjust marketing spend, promotional construct and pricing as needed depending on the market environment to maximize each voyage's contribution to the bottom line.  The next priority is rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives. Mark will dive into more detail on the great progress we've already made on this critical effort but I want to emphasize that we have many additional opportunities in the pipeline to do even more, and we are not shying away from this challenge. The reality is we are operating against the different backdrop today than we were in 2019 requiring an even keener focus on balancing the top line with the cost structure that supports our unique business model and allows us to accelerate our margin recovery and help build resilience to vary external and macroeconomic environments. We are undertaking this effort with a strategic and data-driven approach that allows us to identify additional opportunities for efficiencies, sets, monitor and maintain accountability against concrete KPIs and increased agility to adapt quickly as market or consumer preferences evolve. I'm pleased to report that we're already seeing a change in the core culture of the company at every level of the organization to emphasize efficiency, cost mindfulness and results without impacting the guest experience. We built significant momentum in recent months with this initiative, and we look forward to demonstrating continued improvement in the coming quarters.  This does tells nicely into our next priority, which is to make strategic and intentional modifications to enhance our offerings and better align them to our guests' needs and wants. There is no question that investment in our product and service offerings are critical to keeping our brand value propositions intact. However, we are refocusing the business on making smart investments in areas that generate the highest return and maximize guest satisfaction over the course of their entire cruise journey starting from the time they book.  For example, we are deep in the development of a streamlined booking process at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand which uses generative AI technology to personalize the experience for guests, while also simplifying and reducing the number of considerations required to book by orders of magnitude. This, along with several other initiatives underway, should translate to more satisfied guests who spend more on board and return to sale with us more frequently, resulting in a win-win of higher yields and stronger loyalty.  Turning to the fourth priority on the list. The entire team is hard at work preparing for the delivery of Norwegian Viva on Thursday as well as Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November, which you can see on Slide 7. I just came back from Italy where I visited the shipyards to check on their progress and I left even more excited than I was previously to welcome these new additions to our already guest and class slate. Both are sister ships to existing vessels that have been elevated even first so we have a high degree of confidence that there will be an overwhelmingly positive reception the ships from our guests and travel partners, which we are already seeing in their incredible advanced booked position. I'm also pleased that both are on schedule and on time for delivery despite supply chain and other challenges, a testament to our great working relationship we have developed with our partners at Fincantieri. In June, we announced that global Munich sensation in Aladdin music icon, Louis Fonsi, will serve as Godfather to Norwegian Viva. The announcement alone generated a reach of over 200 million globally, including new audiences in the targeted Spanish-language demographic. The ship will be christened in Miami later this year and home port in San Juan, Puerto Rico starting in December for a season of Caribbean itineraries. We also recently announced Seven Seas Grandeur Godmother Sarah Faberge, the great grand order of Peter Carl Faberge, the legendary artist jeweler and created an entrepreneurial genius to find a world renowned company that bears his name. This is a natural choice and celebration of Regions partnership with Faberge.  The disciplined addition of new build is a key component to our strategy, and we have said consistently in the past, we welcome new hardware introductions as they not only generate excitement and bring more attention and awareness to our brand but they are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. As the smallest of the 3 large public cruise operators, we continue to believe that we have outsized opportunity to grow our footprint and meaningfully drive the bottom line. Our new build pipeline, which you can see on Slide 8, represents approximately 50% capacity growth by 2028 versus 2019, a CAGR of approximately 5%. After the delivery of 3 newbuilds in 2023, a record for the company, we have no additional ship delivery scheduled until spring of '25. In the interim, we expect to benefit from both organic growth as well as the annualization of the 2023 new build next year.  And lastly, the final priority on the list, but arguably the most important is starting the path to reduce leverage and derisk the balance sheet. Given the necessary actions we took to navigate the past few challenging years, our leverage ratios are currently not at optimal levels. Our goal remains to evaluate all options available and then clearly define a multiyear pathway to return to an investment-grade like financial position. This only happened overnight, but as you can see on Slide 9, the company has successfully reduced leverage in the past, and I am confident we will do so again.  In the interim term, our expected cash flow generation boosted by our robust new build pipeline, along with normal course debt installment payments are expected to result in significant organic improvement in our net leverage. Over the next several months, we are focused on the successful execution of our near-term priorities while fine-tuning the future vision and strategy for the company with 3 strong brands, a world-class C and destiny industry, we are starting from a strong foundation and a position of strength. And I can say without a doubt that we have a bright future ahead with significant potential to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders. Shifting our discussion now to our current bookings demand and pricing trends. We achieved rental revenue of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2019. We have been able to tap into strong consumer demand environment, achieving the right balance of underlying revenue growth with net per diems up 6%, while at the same time materially growing our fleet with capacity of 19% for the quarter. We also kept our ships full, reaching a load factor of 105% in the second quarter, in line with guidance and a long awaited milestone as we return to normalized levels, which you can see on Slide 10.  As previously mentioned and as illustrated on Slide 11, several years ago, we strategically shifted our deployment to longer, more immersive itineraries at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand and increased our concentration of premium destinations while reducing our Caribbean deployment. This was designed to attract a higher quality guest and maximize our competitive position. A natural bright product of this new deployment mix is left third and fourth passengers in the cabin, which is what historically pushed passenger occupancy above the 100% mark. As a result, we expect full year occupancy going forward to be roughly 200 basis points lower than 2019 levels. This shift also resulted in an elongation of our booking window which was 255 days in the second quarter, an increase of 51 days or 20% compared to the same quarter in 2019 and meaningfully enhancing our future visibility and reducing our exposure to volatile and less predictable cost in bookings.  Thinking together, we believe this strategy will drive higher yields, higher guest satisfaction and higher guest repeat rates with longer runway to optimize our pricing and marketing strategy as macro environment evolved over time. Turning to Slide 12. Our cumulative book position for the second half of 2023 remains ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices another indication of continued healthy demand environment and the resilience of our target consumer. This strength continues past this year to sailings in 2024 and beyond, which at this point in the booking curve is our primary focus. In fact, over the past 90 days, over 70% of our ticket sales were for 2024 and '25 sailings, considerably higher than in 2019. Onboard revenue generation, our best real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially today also continues to perform exceptionally well. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue for passive Cruise Day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. Our efforts to enhance our market-leading bundled offerings and increase quality touch points with our guests starting from the time of booking and continuing throughout their cruise journey are clearly bearing fruit.  In fact, presold revenue on a per passenger day basis for the second quarter of 2023 was over 75% higher than in 2019. An important contributor to our onboard revenue strength as these guests tend to spend more overall throughout their journey than guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, in which Slide 14 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we published our annual Sail & Sustain report and disclosure on World Environmental Day in June. The report provides transparency in our progress and initiatives on top ESG priorities. Some of the highlights this year for more detail on our new climate action strategy and enhanced data and disclosures on community impact, human capital and greenhouse gas emission reported. In addition, we demonstrated progress against several of our environmental goals, including targets to equip our ships with short power capabilities and reduced bunkering of freshwater. I encourage all of you to take some time to explore the report and welcome -- I'm sorry, to explore the report and visit our website for more information. I'm also proud to share that just last week, we announced the winners of our annual Giving Joy recognition program that has been celebrating teachers across North America since 2019 for their hard work and relentless dedication. Each of the 20 winning educators want a free 7-day voyage for 2 and the top 3 grand prize winners were invited to attend the exclusive cresting voyage for Norwegian Depot. This year's content drew support from over 3,400 teachers across the U.S. and Canada and garnered hundreds of thousands of lots. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our second quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019.  Slide 15 highlights our second quarter results in which we are very pleased to report that we've met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, results were strong with revenue per up 33% and net per diems increasing approximately 6.5%, surpassing the high end of guidance, while net yield was in line with guidance at 2.9%. Keep in mind that comparisons to 2019 includes certain premium-priced Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year, which did not operate in 2023.  Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, came in below in the quarter, demonstrating further improvement from the prior quarter and the high watermarks seen in the second half of 2022. The reduction in cost this quarter was primarily driven by lower food costs and crew optimization efforts as we continue to realize the benefits of cost savings initiatives identified and implemented during the first phase of this initiative. I will note that across all 3 brands, our guest satisfaction scores remain strong, reflecting our continued focus on cost rationalization without impacting the guest experience. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $30 million higher than our guidance at approximately $515 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS of $0.30 also beat our projection by $0.05, and was the first time we generated positive EPS since 2019 as well as the first time that our quarterly adjusted EBITDA exceeded the same quarter in 2019. Shifting our attention to guidance. Our out for the third quarter can be found on Slide 16. We are projecting net per diem growth of approximately 7% to 8% and net yield growth of approximately 2.25% to 3.25%. Similar to the second quarter, the loss of certain premium priced Baltic itineraries will continue to impact the comparison versus 2019. In the fourth quarter, pricing and yield are both expected to exhibit mid-teens growth compared to 2019. There are several other factors contributing to the exceptionally strong growth we are expecting for the fourth quarter which include more luxury and upper premium capacity operating with the new region and Oceania ships as well as a favorable comp from the rapid exit from Cuba in 2019 and the close in resale of those sailings. Adjusting for these factors, net per diem growth is still expected to be up approximately 10%, which reflects our organic pricing power and strong consumer demand that Harry referred to as well as the benefit of our shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and Europe seasons this year.  Given that we have already -- we already have a substantial booked position and our pace of bookings is on track with our optimal booking curves. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this top line outlook for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $152 in the third quarter which includes approximately $3 of certain nonrecurring benefits realized in the quarter.  Looking ahead, there are also onetime expenses associated with new capacity additions in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these items, this metric is expected to slightly decrease quarter-over-quarter, which is noted on Slide 17. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter is expected to be approximately $730 million, and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.70 on a projected diluted share count of approximately 510 million shares. Keep in mind that we have our 4 outstanding exchangeable notes, which will cause variability in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate EPS when we follow the if-converted method. It is also important to note that despite our ability to settle our 2 2027 exchangeable notes in cash rather than its shares, these notes would still be included in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for GAAP reporting purposes, if they are dilutive in the quarter. We've included an additional slide in our earnings deck, Page -- Slide 24, with more information to help with modeling.  Now shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023, we are raising the floor of our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion despite approximately $30 million of headwinds for our interest and fuel expense in the back half of the year. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.80 or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the second quarter outperformance. As you can see on Slide 18, since we first guided for the year in February, we have increased our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 or 14% on strong results in the underlying business which overcame headwinds from higher fuel FX and interest rates. Excluding these headwinds, adjusted EPS growth versus initial guidance would have been approximately 20 percentage points higher.  Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, our healthy net per diem growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019 and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance with capacity up 18%.  Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel first capacity date is expected to average approximately $156 for the full year better than the prior guidance of $159, reflecting lower-than-expected costs in the second quarter. As we have previously mentioned, when comparing this metric to 2019, please note that we do not have the benefit from the disposal of older, less efficient tonnage that some of our peers have. And we have also added capacity at our high-end Oceania Regent brands, which while accretive to margins do have higher operating costs.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the timing of expenses such as dry docks can cause variability in these metrics when comparing different periods. For example, in 2023, we have limited dry docks as we took the opportunity during the pandemic to optimize the schedule while ships were already out of service. As Harry noted earlier, this improvement is the result of the deliberate actions we have taken to enhance margins and rightsize our cost base. To further supplement our internal efforts, which have been in full force since we kicked off this initiative last fall. We have also more recently engaged a third-party consultant to benchmark best practices across sectors and identify incremental areas of opportunity.  Our entire team is working around the clock to find ways to accelerate our margin recovery, and we are leaving no stone unturned in the process. To date, the savings we have identified in the broad-based have been broad-based, touching every aspect of the business with the largest buckets consisting of fuel, food and consumables and marketing, as shown on Slide 19.  To give you an example of one of the initiatives we are undertaking, we are optimizing crew movements and reducing ship crew transfers, which we expect to result in multimillion dollars savings. To put this into context, each year, we have approximately 90,000 crew movements including 6,000 or so between ships. This is just one example, but it demonstrates how incremental changes can add up to a larger impact on the bottom line. We recognize that we still have more work to do, and we are committed to doing so in a way that preserves the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels that our target higher-end guests expect from our brands all while setting us up well for continued margin improvement in the next few years.  Turning our attention to the balance sheet and our debt maturity profile on Slide 20. In the first half of the year, we generated over $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations, including over $1 billion in the second quarter. This allowed us to repay approximately $1.4 billion of debt including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving credit facility. In addition, we have approximately $475 million of scheduled debt payments for the back half of the year, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing.  As we have previously stated, we intend to refinance our operating credit facility in the normal course of business before year-end. As mentioned earlier, we expect our net leverage to improve significantly, driven by our organic cash flow generation and payment of scheduled debt installments. Excluding debt associated with ships on order for future delivery, trailing 12 months net leverage is expected to meaningfully reduce versus current elevated levels dropping below 6x over the course of the first half of 2024. This does not adjust for ships that were delivered in 2023 which would have the full debt load in the numerator without a full year of contribution included in adjusted EBITDA.  Turning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong at approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end, as outlined on Slide 21. This consists of approximately $900 million of cash and cash equivalents, $875 million under our revolver and a $650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate $300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity, but is not currently available to draw. During the quarter, we received approximately $500 million of cash collateral back from a credit card processor. This collateral release not only provided a meaningful increase to liquidity but was also a very strong signal that our external partners have increased confidence in our financial position and future outlook.  Overall, I feel the same optimism about the direction of our business. I want to echo Harry's comments that our entire management team is reinvigorated and focused on delivering on our business and strategic goals while also pursuing all opportunities to maximize value creation and create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing comments. Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Mark. So before turning it over to Q&A, I'd love to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can also see on Slide 22. First, we are focused on execution of the near-term priorities outlined today, including the delivery of 2 new builds in the coming months, while simultaneously fine-tuning our vision of the future. With new leadership in many functions, including my own, we are approaching this exercise of open minds and a fresh perspective as we work to best position the company for success.  Second, our target higher-end demographic continues to be healthy and resilient with strong demand for travel and experiences. This is demonstrated by our strong revenue performance, a record up 33% in the quarter with our strong book position, which when looking over the next 12 months is within our sweet spot range of approximately 60% to 65% booked and at higher prices and advanced customer deposits of $3.5 billion, 52% over Q2 2019. Third, we are demonstrating the results of our margin enhancement initiatives, including through our efforts to maximize revenue, improve efficiencies and right size costs. We now have 2 straight quarters of sequential improvement in our key cost metrics and we'll continue to identify and implement additional measures to accelerate our margin recovery while still delivering the exceptional product and service offerings that our guests desire.  Lastly, our liquidity position is solid and we are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet and reducing leverage in the coming years. We've covered a lot today. So I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Jessica John : Before we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address the top questions from our online shareholder Q&A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and upvote questions for management. One of the top voted questions we received this quarter was, what do you consider the biggest challenge for growth over the next 18 to 24 months? And how do you plan to attack that challenge? Harry, do you want to take that one? Harry Sommer : Sure, Jessica. I'm happy to, and that's really a great question. I wouldn't say there are big challenges for growth. If anything, what we have is a huge opportunity. While we're always keeping a keen eye on growing revenue on our existing fleet while tempering costs, growth in the cruise industry is mainly predicated on capacity. And this year, we had 3 vessels entering the fleet, one for each of our award-winning brands, which is the first for our company. This growth allows us to take more guests to more destinations and offer them more varied experiences while contributing to the top and bottom line right off the bat. In addition, with no scheduled shift deliveries in 2024, we have ample opportunity to divest its capacity at high sizes while preparing for new capacity entering our fleet in 2025. So to me, it's not about challenges of growth. It's optimizing the opportunity we have for our new capacity and doing what we have consistently done in the past, which has translated that to outsized impact to our bottom line. Jessica John : Operator, we can take the first question from the line now. Operator : Our first question from the line comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company. Vince Ciepiel : I wanted to talk about kind of the path for organic price growth. I think that was really helpful the way you broke out 4Q, obviously, anticipated to step up a lot. But even comparisons and new hardware, net per diems up 10% points to sequential acceleration through the course of this year. So curious kind of how you're thinking about that into next year? I know you get a lift from full year contribution of the 2023 deliveries. But how are you feeling on organic price today versus 90 days ago? Harry Sommer : Sure. I'm happy to take that one. Thanks for the question. I think I can sort of break this up into 3 periods, Q4, 2024 and 2025 and beyond. Q4 still has some comparable distinctions between this year and the past but we are super excited that we're going to see an 18% net per diem growth in '23 versus '19, sort of fully hitting our strides there, and we're pretty well booked for Q4. So we have great confidence in that number. You turn to 2024, we get to a more normalized environment, but we still had some tailwinds on when we compare '24 to '23 because in Q1 of 2023, we were 100% back up in service. So I think we can expect some outsized growth in '24 relative to '23. On a more long-term basis, return back to norm. We've consistently talked about having low to mid-single-digit yield increases year-over-year with moderate and disciplined capacity growth, strong cost control while maintaining high guest satisfaction all leading to the type of oversight dividend earnings growth you saw during our run from '14 to '19. So I think once we get back to '25, that's exactly the path we'll be on again. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And then maybe on the cost side, obviously, a lot of effort that is visible based on the guide that looks like net cruise revenue is going to be up $2.5 billion plus this year whereas costs certainly up about $100 million. So it's clear that you guys have been focused. Curious, you mentioned guest satisfaction score remaining strong, kind of along this flex down path. But curious maybe what you're seeing within rebooking behavior as more of that 2024 business is coming on the books? How you're feeling about the guests coming back to you? Harry Sommer : So it's a great question. I think there were 2 parts, so I'll try to address both of them. On the cost side, we are really excited about the efforts that we make and you continue to see the sequential modest improvements in costs, Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and Q4 despite the fact that inflation is still out there for the fact that we continue to reduce our cost structure each quarter, it's not just a reduction in the base but also fighting against inflation. So we're really excited when you can see that number come down. But Mark also alluded to, we're just maybe in the fourth inning of this cost reduction strategy, if I was to use a baseball analogy. And we still believe there are more efforts ahead. We have not baked in anything that we haven't found yet. Our guidance numbers only include what we've identified and what we firmly are able to implement, but we hope to be able to deliver a little bit more in the future.  In terms of the guest rebooking behavior, we're simply put, we're at record levels. Across all 3 of our brands, we are seeing -- the one measure that's most relevant internally is we take a look at first-time guests and how -- and when and how much or what percentage of them, I should say, rebooked within the first year or 2 coming back, and the guests coming off the ships in '23 are relooking at record levels compared to '18, '19 and the further back period. So, so far, the formula seems to be working quite well. Mark Kempa : And Vince, just to highlight that. I think last quarter, we had mentioned record sales of our Cruise -- next certificates. And again, not just another anecdotal point that consumers on board our ships are enjoying their vacation. They're satisfied with the product. Everything we're doing on the cost reduction front is under the lens of protecting the guest experience and the product. So we monitor that closely. And so far, we are seeing positive reception to everything we're doing. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Two questions. One is on the yield side, that 14% growth in Q4. I know you have some shift in your premium luxury brands contributing to that. Can you kind of give us a sense of what the increase would be for saving Norwegian brand? Or just to think about the increase that's embedded in that guidance that outside of those new ship additions, and then my other question is on expense. And I'm sorry if I missed if you said what was the nonrecurring benefit in Q3 there? And then just thinking about Q4. It looks like your footnote is sort of saying you're excluding the cost of new ships in that. And I just wanted to clarify, I feel like you hadn't done that before. I just want to think about comparability to expenses in 2019. So is that new that, that guide excludes the cost of new ships? Mark Kempa : Thanks for the question. So in Q4, when we talk about our pricing or yield, pricing is expected to be up approximately 18%. And as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, if you adjust for the new capacity as well as the favorable year-over-year comps, that 18% would translate to about 10% of your organic fleet. So very, very strong growth consistent with what we've seen over the last 2 to 3 quarters. So we're very, very pleased with that. In terms of Q3, the onetime nonrecurring benefit, we highlighted that because we didn't want to take artificial credit so to speak, for our cost-reduction initiatives. And that was simply a benefit that we received as a result of some port volume commitments accruals that we had during the course of COVID. We were able to negotiate with the various ports around the world to reduce that. So we didn't want to take credit for that because it's a onetime nonrecurring, so we called that out. And then in Q4, again, trying to be ultra-transparent on the surface, it would appear that our net cruise cost ticks up slightly by $1. But if you really look at that and you exclude the onetime start-up operating costs for both Viva and Granger, which come on in the fourth quarter, and you really rightsize that to a normal run rate that is actually reduced by $1 or $2. So again, what we're trying to do is show that we have sequential improvement in our core fundamental operating costs, and you're seeing that over the course of all 4 quarters in the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Charles Scholes : First question concerns the onboard and other line item. How much as we think about for next year and perhaps 2025, you've certainly seen outside growth in this line item. How much do you think of that is really sustainable and how much might be from revenge travel and maybe some of the growth also might be from bundling or accounting changes. So how should we think about sustainability of that going forward? Harry Sommer : Patrick, it's a good question. I believe it's fully sustainable. We don't necessarily see this huge revenge travel being a huge club nor the levels that we are going at today, diminishing. My best proxy is the Norwegian Cruise Line brand because it's our largest brand and when we look at bookings for this year, every month, it's been a record month in terms of new booking volume. January was the best January in the history of a company, February to February, cleared through July, which just ended yesterday, which was the best dividend in the history of the company. And in fact, our second best booking month of the year, which is a little bit odd because usually July and August is a little bit slower due to action, and the like. Onboard pet similarly, every month continues to be good. We're not seeing any weakness. We're not seeing any denigration of trends. There's nothing super unusual that we're doing in bundling today compared to '19. We continue to refine our processes and make the marketing and product proposition a little bit better each quarter than the quarter before. But I don't anticipate any huge changes for '24 either. I think the numbers you see today are the numbers that we would expect to improve ongoing into '24. Mark Kempa : And Patrick to further highlight on that is we've talked about we have more touch points with the consumer well prior to the consumer ever stepping on board ship, onboard the vessel. So we're getting more share of the wallet from the consumer ahead of that. And I think one of our stats that we talked about, our prebooked revenue was up by almost 70% versus 2019. So again, it's a longer elongated sales cycle that just helps build that overall onboard revenue product. So we are not seeing any signs of any consumer deterioration. In fact, we continue to see strength on that and we're very happy with that. We continue to see -- expect that to be strong. Charles Scholes : Okay. Just a quick follow-up question, Mark, you had noted in the earnings release about $500 million released from the credit card reserves. Is there any money left still to go with that? Or was that $500 million the last slug of that? Mark Kempa : Yes. So we're very happy with that. So with that, that essentially we have 0 collateral with any of our reserve holders as of the quarter end. So that was not only a significant boost to our liquidity profile long term. But more importantly, as I said in my prepared remarks is that it demonstrates confidence in the business from a completely external partner who has no stake in the game other than their inherent risk on advanced ticket sales. So again, we see that as a big demonstration of confidence in the business and where the trajectory of the business is going. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So if we think about your load factors moving forward, which Mark, you mentioned will be about 200 basis points lower than where 2019 levels were that's you guys are long itineraries and whatnot. Just wondering how these lower load factors impact or potentially impacts your cost structure moving forward. And add on to that, Mark, as we think about you guys exiting the year in that low, let's call it, 150 range in terms of cost per APCD, is there any way to help us kind of think about it as well, where you might be able to get that number to over time? Mark Kempa : Steve, it's a good question. I don't look at this as a huge material change in our cost structure. It will be a modest tailwinds having 2% less guests on the ship and the 2% less guests that we have are primarily young children, which aren't particularly expensive. This really isn't about our cost structure. This is really about yield and EBITDA where we believe being in more premium itineraries that are booked further in vans, giving us a much longer booking curve and a more stable and predictable demand profile, which allows us to manage demand, manage our marketing a little bit more effectively and not rely so much on close-in, unstable and unpredictable demand is really a key to our success. I think both Mark and I commented on the higher rebooking rates, the higher BNS ticket sales, the higher revenue, the higher booking window, all of these positives which seem to endorse our strategy, which I think we'll see the full benefit of in 2024 as we then will have gone through a full year cost structure. So I mean, listen, bottom line is we're committed to getting back to the EBITDA margins that we saw back in '19 over time. It's going to take us a little time to get there, but we're looking at the trends, and we see a path towards that and we think this premium deployment, which we already started shifting to in '18, '19 will be a vehicle that will allow us to continue on that path. And I'll remind you, we have always had industry-leading yields and we continue to have industry-leading yields far above the competitive set, and we believe that this deployment strategy will allow us to continue with that. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And Mark, I just want to kind of add the question I was going to ask before to you. Again, as you kind of think about you guys being in that low 150 range in terms of cost. Just is there any way to kind of help us think about where you could get that number over time. I'm not looking for guidance or anything, but just trying to understand where that number potentially could go? Mark Kempa : Yes. Look, Steve, obviously, as we're looking to 2024, we're still early in the -- we're in the planning process. And as I said, I think we're probably halfway through the baseball game, so to speak, in terms of initiatives. So we fully anticipate that we're going to improve on that. One note, as I did say in my prepared remarks is we have to keep in mind that there is going to be some dry dock pressure in 2024 when you compare that to '23. But excluding that, I would venture to say that we're going to continue to see improvement in our core fundamental cost structure. So we're working hard. Hopefully, we've demonstrated and given you confidence that quarter-over-quarter, we sequentially continue to improve. We think there's more -- we think there's more to go after, and we're going after it. We're going to do it in a methodical manner, but protecting that guest experience. So stay tuned for the next few quarters to come, and I think we'll continue to show improvement. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : So I'm just curious if you could comment on the last 3 months of just fundamental demand strength on the booking side. We've heard from peers that demand has accelerated over those last 3 months. Harry, you just called out in May, June, July being each successively record booking months. But yield guidance for the year was left unchanged. And so I guess the question is, is that a function of guidance 3 months ago just already sort of betting on that acceleration coming? Or did slight flight prices in Europe take a bite out of 3Q? I think we talked about that last quarter or anything else that you might want to highlight? Harry Sommer : Thanks, Brian. Great question. I think with our deployment strategy, most of the demand that we're seeing today and over the last quarter, is primarily focused on 2024. I think we mentioned in our commentary, but if we did, and I'll mention it now, that over the last 13 weeks, over 70% of our new booked revenue was for '24 and '25 departures. So in that respect, this acceleration in demand, the record booking levels that I discussed really are increasing our optimism about 2024. Obviously, in prior guidance, we did assume some bookings, right, for the back half of the year, and they're coming to fruition just as we expected, but these records are really helping to firm up the '24 book position. I mean this record booking window of 255 days, which is 51 days ahead of where we are in '19 is a huge number for the company and again, really gives us confidence for 2024 and beyond. Mark Kempa : So Brandt, I would not take it as any sort of sign of deceleration in demand. It's just simply a function of our itineraries, we're more fully booked than we ever have been, and there's just not a lot left to sell, so which is a good thing. That gives us more stability and predictability over our numbers. So if anything, that said, there's always -- as we talked about, the consumer is strong onboard revenue trends continue to do well. So I think if there's going to be any room for upside, it's going to be on continued strength of the consumer spend on board. Brandt Montour : That's really helpful. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that. I remember pre-COVID, Mark, specifically, you guys could get really great returns on incremental marketing dollars, and that was part of the strategy back then. And so -- now in a world where you guys are, I think, trying to be a little bit, I guess, smarter, you call it, on your marketing dollar spend and Harry, what you think about this. Just as you tinker with that, sort of algorithm or equation with marketing spend. What are you learning about that process? Are you happy with sort of the pricing retention that you're getting as you sort of tinker with the marketing dollars? Or any commentary on that would be helpful. Mark Kempa : I think, Brandt, this is really the first quarter or the second quarter where marketing spend was sort of normal, where we were able to judge each of the individual projects that we do in marketing and see normal ROI, normal returns, normal gets demand. But of course, we weren't just waiting through the last couple of quarters to refine our marketing machine. We've gone all in with marketing analytics. We've done some work with AI, machine learning, all those terms to really refine our individual marketing efforts and what we spend in each individual channel.  The best example I can give you on the NCL brand, our spend today on a booking basis, it's similar to what we were doing in '19, but we're generating nearly double the lease right, which is sort of a customer that raises their hand. We think that's fantastic. Conversion rates continue well, which is one of the things that's leading to these record bookings. And as long as we continue refining our analytics around marketing, we're happy with the spend levels. Operator : Our next question comes from James Hardiman with Citi. James Hardiman : So on the net per diem side, good performance in the second quarter, maybe a little surprised that, that didn't flow through to the full year guide. And I can certainly appreciate more often than not, if it's onboard spend that's driving that for diem, it's hard to sort of assume -- you have less visibility as we think about the back half of the year. Is that ultimately what happened in Q2 or how should we think about sort of the lack of flow through to the full year? Mark Kempa : Well, James, I think our pricing continues to be very strong. And I think out of the gate, we set very high levels. So again, I wouldn't read into anything whether or not that's -- if there's any deceleration, there is flow through. And the fact that we're still guiding, reiterating 9% to 10.5% growth. So very strong -- we don't have a lot of inventory left to sell, which is by design. So I think it's really going to be on the back of what does the onboard spend level do. And as we've touched on here and several times before, it continues to be very strong. But while we have good visibility on that, there is always some variability on that. So it remains to be seen. And -- but everything we're seeing is we're seeing strength and demand across all sectors of the industry. James Hardiman : Got it. That's helpful. And then a separate question. I mean, we started to see refinancing activity pick up, maybe a more full corporate debt environment. What are you seeing there? Is there an opportunity for you guys to do some transaction whether it be a focus on lowering interest rates, extending maturities. I guess if so, what instruments are sort of low-hanging fruit for you guys? I guess, more broadly, I mean, as you think about deleveraging, it seems like the messaging has been more about increasing EBITDA than actually reducing debt. This current environment maybe changed any of that calculation? Mark Kempa : Well, we're -- James, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize our debt structure. And I think we were very fortunate in 2022 to get rid of some of our higher cost debt that was incurred during the pandemic. So we don't have any double-digit notes that are out there. As I did say, we will be out in the market later this year in normal course to refinance or amend and extend our operating facilities, which is our term loan A and our revolver. Beyond that, our next big slug of debt as it comes due in December of 2024. We have notes that are out there. And we'll look over the course of the next 12 months, what to do with that. But as the cash machine continues to ramp up, as advanced ticket sales continue to ramp up, as EBITDA and margin continues to improve, that is the number one thing we're focused on is delevering to -- in order to help derisk the stock.  So we're going to -- we're focused on that. We've done this before. It's going to take a little bit of time. But I think there's more to see over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Harry Sommer : And James, I'll just take this opportunity to reiterate a comment that Mark made in his prepared remarks that we have paid down $1.4 billion of debt in the first half of the year which we're super excited about. James Hardiman : Got it. That's really helpful. And Harry, congratulations on the new role and good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : Just one for me. Harry, in the prepared remarks, you made a comment around just culture change that's underway at the company. Can you just provide a little context to that comment? Is it -- why do you need it now? And what's the most -- what's the biggest pressing that you want to achieve with it -- or is that more of a comment just around just the refreshing? Harry Sommer : Well, I think Conor, it's a little bit of both, right? With new leadership team, we have to set a culture that's going to work for us in the mid- to long term. And I'm really excited that the entire leadership group, both the new members and the existing ones are embracing. But if I was to sum it up in one sentence, we're looking to build a culture where we're firmly focused on margin enhancements that we discussed while at the same time delivering exceptional guest experience. And it's really a fine line to walk -- I mean you can cut costs and have a worse guest experience. That's not what we're looking to do. Maybe in the past, we were a little bit overly focused on the guest experience without the cost side of it. The question is, how do we balance both of it. And I have to say, I'm excited. Mark and I have both talked about the reduction, the sequential improvement in our underlying core plus over all 4 quarters of this year, while at the same time our guest satisfaction continues to do very well. Our first guest repeat rate is at record levels, really good guest satisfaction scores, advanced bookings through the root. So this formula seems to be working well. To do this right, it has to take more than one quarter because we're not looking to do anything drastic. We're looking to do this a little bit at a time and make sure that we monitor it closely, and that's what we're going to continue to do.  Thank you, Conor. So with that, Maria, we have time for one last question. So please call it out. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : Just a quick question, Harry. It feels like there's been a tangible shift more to focus on the cost side than the yield side. Maybe that's just reflected in current numbers versus how you're looking at things. But I guess as you think about 2024, 2025 and as you think about also long-term targets, is this an accurate depiction? And could we maybe get long-term targets from you as you kind of settle into the role later this year or possibly early 2024? Harry Sommer : So Dan, great question. So first off, we are absolutely focused on yield and cost, right? Because ultimately, margin is a combination of those 2 numbers. I think I discussed in one of the earlier questions that we think we can do an outsized job in 2024 in yield growth somewhat because of the tailwinds we saw in Q4 and '23 when we weren't fully back up to operations, but also because of all the healthy consumer demand metrics that we're seeing over the last few months that we believe will continue into the future. And on a long-term basis, we are committed to a low to mid-single-digit yield increases with moderate and disciplined capacity growth as we had in 2014 to 2019.  So that absolutely will continue. In terms of long-term target, we think about it a lot, but I've been on the job now for 30 days. So a little bit early for me to go all in. I've been spending a lot of time with our -- on our ships, with our operations folks, with our employees, with our travel agency community, with our customers, spending some time with the investment community as well. And we believe by early '24, we'll be in the position to provide not only guidance for '24, of course, but also long-term metrics on how we view the future EBITDA margin, yield and cost components of the business going forward.  Okay. So once again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around to answer any questions you may have. Have a great day. Stay safe and all the best. Bye now.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John. Mrs. John, thank you, please proceed. Jessica John : Thank you, John and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings and business update call. I\u2019m joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company\u2019s Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today\u2019s call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2023 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry? Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Jessica and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we get into prepared remarks, if you haven't already heard the good news, I'd like to congratulate Jessica on her recent appointment to Chief Strategy Officer for Regent Seven Sea Cruises. I'd also like to welcome Sarah Inman, who recently joined the company, last week, as our new Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. We are very pleased to have Sarah on the team, and I'm sure many of you will have the chance to meet her in the weeks and months ahead. As she ramps up on the company, Jessica will continue to be available in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. Congratulations to Jessica and congratulations to Sarah. Now, in turning to results, I'm pleased to share with you this morning that we achieved strong third quarter results generating record revenue and a meeting or exceeding guidance on all key metrics. I have to attribute this success to the hard work and dedication of our incredible team members both on our ships and our offices worldwide. We also continue to make good progress on both defining our longer term strategic vision and executing on the near-term priorities I shared last quarter, which are shown on Slide 5. First, our team is focused on capitalizing on the strong demand environment for cruise to ensure we stay on our optimal booking curve, while maximizing pricing and onboard revenue generation. On a 12-month forward basis, our book position continues to be at record levels within our optimal ranges and at higher prices. While we are very pleased with our progress so far in building our book for 2024 and beyond, we are also keeping a close eye on the evolving macroeconomics and geopolitical landscape and are ready enable to adapt if needed. The next priority is rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives. Since we kicked off this initiative last year, we have seen sustained momentum with three consecutive quarters of improvement in our operating cost metrics. And what's even more encouraging is that we have done this without impacting the guest experience, as evidenced by our continued strong guest satisfaction level, continued strong onboard future cruise sales and guest repeat rates and continued high onboard spend. These results have been driven by a palpable change in culture, with team members across the globe, shipboard and shoreside embracing the challenge to find new and innovative ways to accelerate our margin recovery, while still preserving our long-term brand equity. To give you just one example. Last month, we took the time to tour Norwegian Jewel ahead of the scheduled 2025 dry dock. We walked through each planned project while on board, stopping to get real-time guest feedback to help identify the highest value opportunities. The result of this more methodical approach resulted in not just lower cost, but also shortened the expected length of the dry docking self by nine days, which will allow us to return the shift to revenue generating service that much faster. All in all, the changes we made to the dry dock plan are expected to result in over 20% CapEx savings and a few million dollars of incremental revenue versus our original plan. It was a day well spent. While we have less of the lowest hanging fruit still available at this point, several opportunities like this remain untapped. I want to reassure you that we are committed to keeping the same relentless focus, vigilant and balanced approach to identifying, evaluating and executing on opportunities in a methodical manner. This is not a one-off exercise to us, but rather something we are embedding in the DNA of our entire organization. This leads us to our next priority, which is to make strategic and intentional enhancements to our offerings and guest experience. With the continued keen focus on costs, we are still making smart, high-return generating modification and investments in products and service offerings. For example, in the fourth quarter, we are launching Air Choice for Norwegian Cruise Line. This will allow guests to upgrade from our current bundled air offering in which guests are signed flight at the lines discretion and allow them to choose their specific preferred flights for a fee. This is expected to have a dual benefit of improving both guest satisfaction and generating incremental revenue. We are also making disciplined investments in technology for better websites and mobile apps to Universal Starlink High-Speed Internet across our entire fleet by the end of 2024. Our high-value targeted efforts to provide an excellent guest experience have not gone unnoticed. In fact, Norwegian Cruise Line was just named the top net megaship cruise line by Conde Nast Traveler in their 2023 Reader's Choice Awards. Readers voted for their top choices based on several categories, including service, food, accommodations and sustainability and Norwegian Cruise Line 1. So it's clear that our product continues to resonate strongly with our guests. Turning to the fourth priority on the list. After welcoming Oceania Vista in May, in August, we took delivery of the incredible Norwegian Viva, the second ship in the game-changing prima class and we're not done yet. This year is the first year in our history in which we are introducing one ship for each brand, all of which were built with our incredible partners at Fincantieri in Italy. In just a few weeks, I will be heading back to Italy to take delivery of Regent Seven Sea Grandeur, which you can see on Slide 6. Grandeur rounds out the highly successful Explorer class for Regent, taking luxury cruising to another level. The reception for these ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board, whether it's from our valued travel agents, our loyal pass guests or guests trying one of our award-winning brands for the very first time. The disciplined addition of new builds continues to be a key cornerstone of our strategy as they are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. Our New built pipeline, which you can see on slide 7, represents a 5% capacity growth CAGR from 2019 to 2028, and we are confident in our ability to absorb this growth profitably. We remain in talks with our shipbuilding partners to embark on a new vision for all three of our brands and plan to continue to add new ships across our brands at the right time and at the right interval. But for now, after the delivery of Grandeur this month, we have no additional ship delivery scheduled until spring of 2025 and in the interim, we expect to benefit from both organic growth as well as the annualization of the 2023 newbuilds next year. The final priority on the list, shown on slide 8, is charting a path to reduce leverage and derisk the balance sheet. While the return to investment grade like financial position will be a multiyear process, we continue to expect a significant organic improvement in our net leverage in the intermediate term, driven by our expected cash flow generation and normal course debt amortization payments. With new leadership and perspectives across our organization, we have embarked on a review of our entire business, taking a fresh look at all aspects of our strategy. We are embracing change while preserving what makes it special, and we are committed to take back a leadership position not just in cruise, but in the broader travel, leisure and hospitality sector. In our view, no idea is too big or too small. We have a full vision for what the future holds for Norwegian, so we're taking the time to be thoughtful and thorough as we identify opportunities to ultimately drive more value for our shareholders. Our goal is to share this plan with all of you sometime in spring of next year, along with associated multiyear financial targets. Now, turning to slide 9. As we focus on closing out the year strong, successfully executing on our near-term priorities and defining our long-term strategic plan and vision for the future, our team is more united to energize now more than ever. In fact, earlier this month, we held our global conference in Miami, the first time in several years that we have brought together leaders across all three of our amazing brands in person. This year's the next gen was all about the future and how we can reach further individually and collectively, to accelerate momentum as we move into 2024 and beyond. It was an opportunity to read the team together to spur innovation and collaboration and ensure that across the organization, we are overline and marching towards the same goals as we strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth. This served to further cement my confidence that we are taking the right steps today to best position the company for the future. Now, shifting our discussions to current bookings, demand and pricing trends shown on slide 10. We achieved record revenue of $2.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2019. The strong consumer demand environment resulted in load factors of 106% in the third quarter, while growing net per diems by nearly 8%, all while absorbing a 20% growth in capacity. Before we get into operational details, in recent months, we have seen the devastation caused by both the wildfires and Mali and the escalating conflict in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by these tragic events. Our priority remains the safety, security and well-being of our guests, team members and the communities we visit, and we have mobilized to modify impacted itineraries and help support relief efforts in both regions. Starting with Hawaii, we were uniquely impacted compared to our food peers given our unique year-round inter-island Hawaii offering, the only one in the industry with our US flagged vessel Pride of America. When the wildfires began in August, we quickly modified certain itineraries to avoid straining local resources with the guidance and encouragement of a responsible return from both the Hawaiian Governor Josh Green and the Hawaii Tourism Authority, we resumed our scheduled calls to Kahului, Maui in early September. As it occurred in the past with events of this nature, which received significant attention and media coverage, we did experience a temporary slowdown in close-in bookings for Hawaii ceilings. This impacted not only Pride of America, but also certain sailings on Norwegian Spirit also based in the region for much of the fall, which in total represent approximately 6% of our capacity in the fourth quarter. Demand has steadily improved in recent weeks and while not quite fully recovered yet, it's on the right trajectory and now approaching normalized levels. While we expect some lingering impact in the first quarter, Hawaii only accounts for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, as well as for the full year as Norwegian Spirit repositions outside of the region in December. Turning to Israel. Once the conflict began to escalate, we canceled all calls to Israel for the remainder of the year. We recently made the preemptive decision to cancel calls in Israel in 2024 as well, and our brands are currently working diligently to modify itinerary and communicate these changes to guests. One of the benefits of our industry is that cruise ships are easily movable assets, so we can pivot as needed and still offer incredible itineraries for our guests to enjoy. However, we are seeing both elevated cancellation activity and lower new bookings for this region, primarily for close-in sailings as the conflict is ongoing and still front and center in the consumer psyche. Prior to the conflict, approximately 7% of capacity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4% of capacity for the full year 2024 had visits to the broader Middle East region. Breaking 2024 down a bit further, very little capacity is in this region early in the year, only about 1% of capacity in Q1. That said, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024 and beyond, which on a 12-month forward basis remains in a record position at our optimal levels and at robust pricing levels. Onboard revenue generation, which we view as our single best real-time indicator of consumer confidence also continues to knock it out of the park. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue for Passenger Cruise Day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. This is driven not only by strong demand but also through our multiyear effort to enhance our bundled offerings and pull forward and pre-sell more revenue before a guest ever step foot on the ship, effectively expanding the sales cycle and getting more of the consumers bottle over time. For the third quarter, pre-sold revenue on a per passenger day basis was up over 80% higher than in 2019 with nearly all of our guests purchasing something pre-crews on their own or through our bundled offering. Not only does this lead to higher spend by guests over the course of their entire journey, but it also pulls forward cash inflows for the company. This is one of the reasons why, as you can see on slide 11, our advanced ticket sales balance increased nearly 60% in the third quarter versus 2019, far outstripping capacity growth of 20%. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain in which slide 12 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we partnered with the Global Maritime Forum to advance our shared mission of driving a positive change for the industry, environment and society. We also joined its flagship initiative, the Getting to Zero Coalition, a powerful alliance with more than 200 organizations within the maritime, energy, infrastructure, and finance sectors committed to supporting the maritime industry in its journey towards full decarbonization by 2050. I'm also proud to share that we were recently recognized by Forbes in its World's Best Employers list for 2023. Our team members are, by far, our most important resource, and we are committed to their continued development and well-being. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial results and outlook. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Harry and good morning everyone. My commentary today will focus on our third quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance, and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield, and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019. Slide 13 highlights our third quarter results in which we are very pleased to report that we met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing nearly 8% and net yield increasing approximately 3%, both coming in at the high end of guidance. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $152 in the quarter, demonstrating our third consecutive quarter of improvement since we began our cost reduction efforts in earnest late last year. As expected, this also included approximately $2 of certain non-recurring benefits realized in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $22 million higher than our guidance at approximately $752 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS of $0.76 also meet our projection by $0.06. Overall, we were very pleased with the strong results we generated in the third quarter. Shifting our attention to guidance, our outlook for the fourth quarter can be found on Slide 14. We are projecting very strong net per diem growth of approximately 15% to 16% and net yield growth of approximately 7.75% to 8.75%. Keep in mind, as we laid out last quarter, there are several factors contributing to the exceptionally strong pricing growth we are expecting in the fourth quarter, as a result of more luxury and upper premium capacity operating with our new Regent in Oceania ships as well as the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019. While this is still a strong result on a core basis, we have tempered revenue expectations since we last spoke, primarily on the back of lower occupancy. As Harry touched on earlier, we are experiencing impacts during the quarter from exogenous events in Hawaii and Israel, the latter of which also had implication for parts of the broader Middle East in the form of elevated cancellations and lower booking volumes. In addition, as Norwegian Cruise Line continues to fine-tune its differentiated strategy of longer, more premium itineraries, certain voyages in the late season Eastern Mediterranean and parts of Asia performed slightly below expectations. While this resulted in a disconnect in the fourth quarter of 2023, our booking curves, guest sourcing and marketing plans have already been recalibrated for similar sailings next year, resulting in a book position that is significantly better for the same period in 2024, compared to the same time last year. Shifting to operating costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $151 in the fourth quarter. This also includes certain non-recurring benefits that partially shifted from Q3 and that we do not expect to occur in 2024, and are also partially offset by costs related to inaugural activities. On a normalized basis, unit costs would have been approximately $153 in the quarter. Taking all this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $360 million and adjusted EPS loss is expected to be approximately $0.15 on a projected diluted share count of approximately $425 million. Keep in mind that we have four outstanding exchangeable notes, which will cause variability in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate EPS following the if-converted method. Slide 22, in our earnings deck has more information to help you with modeling. Now shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.86 billion within the previous range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, despite the headwinds expected in the fourth quarter. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.73 compared to prior guidance of $0.80. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, our healthy net per diem growth of approximately 9.25% to 9.75% is slightly narrowed versus previous guidance. Net yield growth is now expected to be 4.25% to 4.75% with capacity up 18%. Moving on to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $155 for the full year, better than our prior guidance of $156. This improvement is the result of the team's round-the-clock efforts to methodically rightsize our cost base. The savings we have identified have been broad-based and touching every aspect of the business, which you can see on Slide 16. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish so far this year in the area of food costs. Since the fourth quarter of 2022, we have reduced these costs per passenger day by nearly 30%, significantly outpacing the easing and food inflation seen in the broader market. These are just a few of the many examples where we have been able to drive significant savings while still preserving the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels that our guests value. As we look ahead to 2024, while we are not ready to give guidance yet, there are a few moving pieces to keep in mind. For example, the timing of expenses like dry docks, will cause variability in the NCC ex fuel metric when comparing periods. In 2023, we have limited dry docks as we took the opportunity during the pandemic to optimize the schedule while the ships were already out of service. In 2024, we expect roughly 170 dry dock days, which will impact NCCs by approximately 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $4 on a unit cost basis including both the impact of the dry dock expenses as well as the impact from reduced capacity days. Turning our attention to the balance sheet and our debt maturity profile on slide 17. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated over $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We've repaid $130 million debt in the quarter and approximately $1.5 billion of debt over the first nine months of the year. For the remainder of the year, we have approximately $330 million of scheduled debt payments, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency back to ship financing. In October, we successfully completed the refinancing of our operating credit facility, extending our debt maturity profile and providing incremental liquidity. Our revolving credit facility was upsized to $1.2 billion from $875 million with a three-year term maturing in October 2026. In addition, the company issued $790 million of 8.125% senior secured notes through 2029. The net proceeds, together with the cash on hand were used to fully repay the approximately $800 million on our Term Loan A, which was to mature in January of 2025. We were particularly pleased with the demand we saw for the new notes issuance. In addition to being significantly oversubscribed, we also saw substantial interest from new investors, reflecting increased confidence from the markets in our financial position and outlook. Turning to net leverage. We continue to expect significant improvement driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled payment of debt installments. Excluding debt associated with our ships on order for future delivery, trailing 12-month net leverage is expected to be meaningfully reduced versus current elevated levels. This does not adjust for ships that are delivered in 2023, which would have the full debt load in the numerator without a full year of contribution included in adjusted EBITDA. Our liquidity position outlined on slide 18 remains strong and would have been approximately $2.5 billion at quarter end, if adjusted for the upsizing of our revolver in October. We continue to believe that our strong liquidity position, coupled with our ongoing cash generation and attractive growth profile, provide a path to meet our near-term liquidity needs, including scheduled debt amortization payments and capital expenditures. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for his closing comments. Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Mark. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways that you can find on slide 19. First, we are focused on execution of the near-term priorities outlined today. Second, we are committed to defining our vision for the future with the comprehensive strategic review we are currently undertaking. Third, consumer demand for travel and experiences continues to be strong. Despite temporary regional disruptions, we continue to maintain a very strong record 12-month forward book position and at higher prices. Our advanced customer deposits also stand at $3.1 billion, 59% higher than Q3 2019. Fourth, we have seen a fundamental shift in culture at our company as a result of our margin enhancement initiatives. We now have three straight quarters of sequential improvement in our key cost metrics and we will continue to identify and implement additional measures to accelerate our margin recovery, while still delivering the exceptional products and service offerings that our guests desire. Lastly, our liquidity position is very strong, and we are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet and reducing leverage in the coming years. We've covered a lot today. So I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Harry. [Operator Instructions] Jessica John : Before we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address a top question from our online shareholder Q&A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and up-vote questions for management. One of the top-voted questions we received this quarter was how are you navigating heightened geopolitical instability. Harry, do you want to take that one? Harry Sommer : Sure. Thank you, Jessica. Appreciate the question. You know one of the main strengths and differentiators in our industry is our ability to reposition our assets, which is what we've done with the heightened tensions in the Middle East. The safety and well-being of our guests and crew members are, without a doubt, our number one priority. And when the unrest in the region began in early October, we immediately modified itineraries starting first with sailings turning or cooling in Israel in the ensuing weeks and expanding modifications to include all sailings through 2024. I want to add that, I'm extremely proud of how our marine commercial and brand teams came together quickly to make these modifications and proactively work on confirming alternative port and communicating them to our guests. We will continue to closely monitor and evaluate future sailings and adjust as needed. We know that making changes such as these on short notice is never easy, that our organization has risen to this latest challenge in a way that demonstrates once again while we're the best team in the industry. Operator, open for questions. Operator : Thank you, Harry. And our first question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dan Politzer : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I mean, I think that the key question and topic that I think us and investors are focused on this morning is your outlook for 2024, unsurprisingly. So I mean, I think you gave a couple of different data points on costs as it relates to dry docks. But I guess, as we think about the ongoing cost savings, how do you think about the next year's adjusted cruise costs outside of the dry docks and then similarly, in terms of the demand picture, which is obviously pretty -- it's a little bit TBD right now in terms of the Eastern Mediterranean and the tensions there. But how would you think about the impact from Israel on yields? Just obviously, it's probably a higher-yielding type itinerary? Thanks. Harry Sommer : Dan, thanks for the question. Good morning. So listen, I'll take the yield demand question, and I'll let Mark comment on cost guidance for next year. Listen, of course, this is a tragic event hearts go out to the victims in that part of the world. But we're hopeful that this will be a reasonably short-term event. So while we've seen obviously some impact on Q4, we have very little of our inventory there in Q1. In fact, we don't meaningfully get back to the region until Q4 of next year. So far, absent a handful of sailings we have in Q1 and Q2, and it's a very, very small percentage of our overall inventory, or we continue to be very, very well booked. In fact, I was looking at the report this morning. And every month, every individual month next year is looked at a higher rate than the same month was at this time last year for 2023. So we're not going to provide guidance today. We've talked about that a little bit in the script, but demand for next year continues to look well. Mark Kempa : And Dan, I'll take the question on the cost. As we have stated, we have been razor-focused on our cost base, trying to right-size it. And I think we've been very successful at demonstrating that with three sequential quarters of decreased unit cost. As we translate to 2024, there is going to be some pressures. We talked about the dry-dock impact, both from the actual dry-dock cost itself as well as the reduced capacity days. That's going to add about 300 basis points or about $4 to the unit cost. So, if you think of where our exit rate at 2023 is somewhere in the zone of $1.53 to $1.54 on a normalized basis and you add about $4 to that, then the piece we're looking at is where does inflation come into play. I can tell you we have a lot of programs underway as part of our margin enhancement initiative and we're going to keep clawing back at all of our cost base. Too early to say how much of the inflationary pressures we can mitigate. But again, I think our demonstration of what we've been able to do over the last three quarters specifically from the back half of 2022, I think presents some very solid data points to start thinking about from a modeling standpoint. Dan Politzer : Got it. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, Harry, your predecessor was pretty adamant about maintaining pricing discipline and avoiding discounting. I mean I guess as you think about next year and all the moving pieces and what seems like a pretty fluid environment and you just added three new ships and you're entering wave season. Is there any change in your approach to pricing? And as you think about the trade-off between loading yields there? Harry Sommer : No, I too am a firm believer of maintaining pricing discipline. Obviously, that's the key to long-term yield growth. It's really hard to come back from significant price discounting because your guests come to expect it. That being said, we're in a fortunate position to be so well booked for next year, record level, the commentary we've given previously on the call and in the script that we really don't need to turn in that direction even if I wasn't a believer, but to be clear, I am. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Steve Wieczynski : Yes, hey guys. Good morning. So, I want to stay on the cost side, if I could, and maybe ask about your margin opportunity moving forward. And maybe just how you balance that margin opportunity versus trying to protect the customer experience on board. And then I guess to follow-up on that, I mean, if you were in to encounter some type of slowdown from a booking or onboard perspective. How do you guys think about the flow through? And maybe what that would look like under a more distressed topline environment? Harry Sommer : Sure. So, let me take the part about balancing cost against customer experience, and I'll let Mark talk about margin opportunities and what may happen in the slowdown environment. Listen, we have great data points. At any given point in time, we have 60,000 or 70,000 guests on some part of their vacation experience. So, we get real-time immediate impact as we make changes. In fact, we talk to guests and study changes before we make them to begin with and I think with this robust view towards guest satisfaction scores, onboard bookings, repeat rate, and onboard revenue generation, we know right away whether it's something that we've done is positive or negative. Now, Steve, I'm not going to say we always get it right. But because we have such a methodical approach to making these changes, we get it right much, much more often than we get it wrong. And that's why despite the fact that inflation continues in the world, we've now had three straight quarters of cost reduction. I share my passion. We're not done. Now, I can't promise that we're going to continue to have cost reductions. Mark talked about a few of the headwinds related to dry-docks for next year and inflation is real. But I can promise that we have a continued focus. This is not a short-term initiative, where we're not halfway there. This is a permanent sea change in the way we view the business that we are constantly going to be attacking every single cost in the business to make sure that it's rightsized and balance against giving guests great experiences. Listen, across our fleet at any given time, something like half of our guests are past guests, we would be foolish to do something that would take away from that. That being said, we're still optimistic about the opportunities out there. Mark Kempa : Steve, and related to the margin improvement and flow-through, let me highlight what Harry just said on the cost side. We really are changing the DNA of the company. This is not a one-time opportunity. This is a continued culture change. So we want to stress that, and we are committed to it. I think one of the things that sets us apart on in terms of whether if there's a slowdown, what are the opportunities to try and mitigate that. Look, I think, first and foremost, we have perfected -- almost perfected the bundling strategy. And I think that's been a very good tailwind for us. In addition to that, when you think about the onboard spend, we continue to get smarter and we continue to get better at getting more of the customers' wallet over time from the point they enter our ecosystem. And we talked about in our prepared remarks that our pre-cruise revenue sales were up over 80% versus same time in 2019. So I think that is a strategy that we'll continue to fine-tune. We never get it exactly right. but I think that provides us some additional protection, again, to get that wall over a longer period of time. We are very focused on margin improvement. We've said this will be -- in our case, this will be a multiyear effort. We don't see anything structurally in the business that would preclude us from getting back to 2019 margins and better. But given our fleet and our deployment mix, I think it's going to take us a little bit longer on our path to do that, but we are ultra committed to do so. Steve Wieczynski : That's great color. I appreciate that, Mark and Harry. And then second question is maybe if you could give some more color around how 2024 is really kind of shaping up from a booking perspective. And look, I fully understand you guys talked about in the release that you're booked in an optimal position. But wondering if you could maybe give some more color around the brands themselves, meaning are you seeing any material differences between, let's say, the Norwegian brand and the two luxury brands into next year? Harry Sommer : We don't, Steve, typically comment on a brand-specific basis. I can just reiterate some of the color we gave already. We are in a record booked position for the next 12 months. We're in a record book position for 2024. If you just want to look at that time period and pricing is higher. So I think past that, we're going to take some time over the next few months to develop this long-term strategy, which will impact everything from our choices on deployment, investments, CapEx onboard product. And at the end of the process, we'll be in a good position to give not just guidance for 2024, but clear the clear financial guideposts, if you will, for 2025, 2026 and beyond. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. So within the updated 4Q yield guide, it seems like pricing is probably more in line with what you were thinking 90 days ago, while more of the change has been in occupancy. Curious, how much of that is related to Israel, Hawaii? And then as you think into 2024, I believe there previously was a view of maybe one to two points structural headwind from changes in the fleet since pre-COVID times, is that still a good way to think about the occupancy recovery path into next year? Mark Kempa : Yeah. Hi, Vince, I think when you think about the occupancy, I think that is still a good way to think about it on a normal annualized basis that it will be down somewhere 200 to 300 points about in the zone of 105 to 106. When you think about Q4, it really is all about occupancy. If you look at our metrics, we were guiding or expecting somewhere about 101 to 102 for the fourth quarter. And right now, we're forecasting roughly 98 and that really is the vast majority related to Israel and the broader Middle East region. We have seen, as we said, an elevated number of cancellations, as well as a lower volume for the close-in sailings, which essentially top off the ship. As well as, as we talked about, we did see some minor hiccups in our late season Asia itineraries, which we believe we fixed from a structural standpoint. But on the pricing side, look, Q4 pricing was strong. We're still expecting to deliver 15% to 16% pricing. So when you think about the change in Q4 revenue, it really is the vast majority on the back of the load, which results in about somewhere in the zone of $40 million to $50 million as a result of these isolated conflicts. Harry Sommer : Yes. And Vince, the only thing I'd add and just to sort of tie this in for a question earlier today, this reinforces our commitment to price integrity, because we didn't chase trying to fill these close-in cancels with low-yielding business. It makes no sense for us to divert our attention away from 2024 to chase another 100 basis points of occupancy of guests who won't necessarily be high yielding guests and won't likely come back. We prefer to keep our focus on 2024, which as we've now repeatedly said is shaping up quite well with a record booked position on those forward 12-month basis and for 2024 on a stand-alone basis. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks and best of luck. Harry Sommer : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed. Harry Sommer : Hi, Robin. Robin Farley : Hi. How are you? I wonder if you could give a little more color. You mentioned some of the product outside of the Middle East and Hawaii having sort of softer close in? You mentioned Asia and maybe other exotics as well. Can you talk a little bit about what you think may be happening there? Because clearly well-understood what's happening with Hawaii and the Middle East, but just a little less clear on what you think may be happening in some of those other destinations? Harry Sommer : I would say that Hawaii and Middle East was widespread. The other area was more what would I say on \u2013 what\u2019s the word I'm looking for. It was just partial, it was not as widespread. So, for example, we've seen a couple of cruises that go through Turkey. When we talk about Eastern Med that have had a few more than normal closing cancels not so much a suppression of demand for next year, more on the closing cancel. And similarly, we've had some cruises as an example, that go from Dubai to India or in those type of regions, which has also seen slightly more closing cancels. But clearly, Hawaii, Middle East are the ones that were widespread across all three brands and most of our Q4 departures, those are the ones for more sporadic. Robin Farley : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just if I have a follow-up, if I can. Just circling back to the expense question. Just looking at your exit rate in Q4 expenses being up about 19% versus 2019 levels. And I think your fleet mix is pretty similar to 2019. Are there sort of big expense increases relative to 2019 that are still kind of holding on there? And is there any opportunity to get rid of any of those costs that driving that 19% increase like that would bring the base down outside of sort of normal inflation there? It seems like there may still be some unusual things in that 19% increase. Thanks. Mark Kempa : Hi. Good morning, Rob. When you look at 2019, Q4 versus 2019, the 2019 for a myriad of the different reasons was a bit lower than our usual run rate even when you look at all the quarters in 2019. Yes, this is a seasonal business. But generally speaking, our costs are not really exposed to seasonal issues. There was just a lot of noise going on in 2019. I think the more important metric to look at is if you look at the run rate and the consistency over the course of 2023 versus 2022, we continue to move downward. And your comment about the fleet mix, I would like to clarify that a bit because I think when we look where we are today, we absolutely have a higher mix of luxury and ultra luxury product from Oceania and Regent that we didn't have back in 2019. So that is playing a part, but I would not focus so much on the absolute number in 4Q 2019, because I think it just was not a representative run rate going forward. Robin Farley : Okay. Thanks a lot. I'm at the fleet next time on a full year basis. But, yeah, Q4 certainly, yeah higher luxury. Okay. Thank you. Thanks very much. Mark Kempa : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please proceed. Brandt Montour : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to follow-up on Robin's first question and talk about those 4Q close-in hiccups that you mentioned. And I want to differentiate between Turkey, which could be construed as indirect impact from what's going on in Israel and that of what's going on in Asia, which sounds like it's more specific to the strategy, the longer-term strategy of moving things to more exotic and -- longer-dated itinerary. So I guess, on that latter stuff, that seems like something that was put in place a while back that we've been talking about for many quarters now. And so I guess the question is, is that something that was 4Q specific based on the destinations and won't roll into the 1Q? Or could there be sort of some leakage into next year on that situation? Thanks. Harry Sommer : So I think the 4Q situation and -- first, let me start off by saying good morning, Brandt. The 4Q situation was really limited to Q4 and related to the fact that we didn't quite get the booking curve right. I mean ,we do lots of things right. We didn't get this one quite right. But when I look at Q4 of next year and comparing it to Q4 this year, we are significantly booked ahead for Q4 of next year, both for Asia itinerary specifically and in general, across the fleet. And that gives us confidence that this short-term dislocation, as Mark mentioned, has been solved for next year. I'm not as concerned about Q1, because if you remember, our Q1 comp will now be back against 2023. And in 2023, we had all types of issues in Q1 in Asia because of COVID restrictions and the like. So that is one of the meaningful tailwinds going into next year. Brandt Montour : Okay. That's helpful. Sorry, everyone else got two questions, so I'm going to take a shot here. The hedge book at 36% -- I mean, the hedge book at 36% is a little -- still a bit below where you would have been. I think at this time in 2019 for 2020, we're at something like 55% or 56%. So, I guess, just update us on the strategy as the way you see it for fuel heading into next year. Mark Kempa : Yes, Brent, there is no change in the strategy. Yes, when you look at 2024, we are 36% hedged. And like we've always said, our goal is we'd like to be about 50% hedged going into a year. And we are just very opportunistic on that front. So, when there's dips in the marketplace, we take advantage of that. There was a little bit of a dip yesterday, and we took advantage of some position. So, no fundamental change in strategy just really timing of the market and when we feel there's a good opportunity to place some additional positions on the books. Brandt Montour : Makes sense. Thanks everyone. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Citi. Please proceed. James Hardiman : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just want to make sure I understand how you guys are thinking about the impact from the Middle East beyond the closing impact for the fourth quarter. I guess, A, as you talk about removing Israel from the itineraries in 2024, obviously, you're replacing that with something. Do you think that's impacted your outlook in any meaningful way for 2024? And then you talked about 4% of your visits being to the Middle East next year. How do we think about how that business is impacted? I think you said, Harry, that you're hopeful and obviously, it's difficult right now, obviously. And our hearts go out to all the people that are affected in the region but that you're hopeful that this will be a short-term event or a reasonably short-term event. Is that with regards to, hopefully, the conflict itself is short-lived and then your business can go back to normal or even in sort of a state of elevated tensions in the region just based on history bookings beyond that epicenter ultimately return to normal. Just want to make sure I understand how to compartmentalize all of that? Harry Sommer : So, James, let me try to deconstruct because you sort of touched upon a couple of points. I'll start out by saying that this 4% that we talk about for next year is mostly skewed to Q4. So, it's 1% of our capacity in Q1, 1% Q3, 3% in Q2, and 10% in Q4. And because it is skewed so far in the future, we're optimistic that the alternative itineraries that we're going to put in place that would go to other places instead of Israel have a reasonable time to book at normal levels. And just -- there was sort of a half push in their US assets if it's correct to assume that any time we remove this role, we'll replace it with something else. The answer to that question is yes. We are not planning to fully cancel or lay out any of our ships because of this disruption. I think when we think about this a little bit longer term, I think it will be a while before people are comfortable going back to Israel which is why we are canceling all Israel calls in 2024, even if the complex was and we hope it does, a reasonably short amount of time, we are more bullish about the ability to return to places like Egypt and other places in the Middle East. And quite frankly, we don't go to that many places in the Middle East, as part of our \u2013 our normal cruise, that it's just normally part of our transitions when ships come and leave Europe at the beginning and end of each season. So that being said, while obviously, it's a little early to tell, and this is somewhat dependent on how long the conflict goes, we're relatively optimistic that the scope and nature of this will not in any way meaningfully impact our 2024 targets. James Hardiman : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Obviously, its difficult but that\u2019s really good color. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just back to costs for a quick second, sorry about that. Just you have a lack of new deliveries in 2024, and you've talked about your strong book position. It just curious on how that might change your marketing spend into next year? It just seems like there will be a natural step down. And then just like the lack of overall deliveries is really what sticks out to me relative to some of your peers in 2024. So just curious on how you're thinking about that specific plan on it. Thank you. Mark Kempa : Thanks, Conor. Yes, you're absolutely right. We don't take after recent grant during December, we don't take our next delivery until spring time of 2025. So we do have a little bit of opportunity there. But I think when you think about the cost and specifically, your question around marketing, there will be -- we do expect a reduction in that area. I would not classify it as a significant reduction because obviously, you are still selling for new capacity that's coming on in 2025, and you sell that well in advance of the delivery date. But of course, we would expect to find some efficiencies on that front simply as a result of that timing between deliveries. Harry Sommer : Yes. Keep in mind, just as a follow-up, that we do have two ships coming in the fleet in 2025, one for Oceania and one for in Seattle, both in the first half of the year. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Harry Sommer : I think we have time for one more question, John? Operator : Thank you. And the final question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please proceed. Patrick Scholes : Great. Thank you. Good morning, Harry and Mark. Certainly, there's some new luxury higher-end capacity with Ritz-Carlton brand for seasons coming in the market next year in 2025. Are you seeing any impact from that new competitive supply on your two higher-end brands? Harry Sommer : Patrick, they are mostly smaller ships, and it's not a meaningful increase in capacity in the overall scheme of things. So the short answer to that question is no, Patrick. We've not seen any change in the trajectory of bookings for either region for Oceania. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up question here. In the press release, you used the word optimal book position. I want to focus on the word optimal. Harry, what exactly is optimal in your mind? What does that mean in this case? Harry Sommer : At a high level, we have defined optimal as being booked 60% to 65% for voyages departing in the next 12 months. It's not a hard and fast rule. We've also said that we're at a record level you can put those $0.02 together and make whatever extrapolation you like. But it's really much more than that, we like to look at every single voyage where they are in the booking curve. Make sure that we're not managing demand pricing, marking the expense in a way that maximizes our bottom line margins. And that's what we mean by optimal. So there's a macro concept and a granular concept on a voyage basis. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. Harry Sommer : Thank you, Patrick. So, once again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around to answer any questions and you get both Jessica and Sarah today, two for one. So with that, I'd love to wish you a good day. Stay safe and all the best. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Donna, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inman. Ms. Inman please proceed. Sarah Inman : Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.  Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2020 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.  Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.  With that, I'd like to call -- turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry? Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I want to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call.  It's such a great time to be in the cruise industry with wonderful new products available across all 3 of our award-winning brands. The demand for cruise vacations is certainly as robust as we have ever seen it. And the continued innovation on board is leading to outstanding financial performance and exceptional guest satisfaction scores and guest repeat rates. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our key milestones in 2023, our progress on our near-term priorities, recent booking trends and our outlook for 2024. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our 2023 performance and guidance for 2024.  Now 2023 can best be described as a landmark year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We started the year on the heels of the last of the impact from COVID and the last of the cruise ports reopening in the Asia Pacific region throughout Q1. But as you can see on Slide 5, consumer demand was quick to rebound in full and we were pleased to return to full ships and full year profitability. It is so incredibly rewarding for our staff and crew to be able to operate full ships and deliver vacation experiences of a lifetime to our happy guests.  While that in and of itself would have made for a spectacular 2023, we were further going by the introduction of 3 new world-class ships into our fleet, one for each of our 3 award-winning brands. This was an unprecedented achievement and a first in the 57-year history of our company. We welcomed Oceania Cruises Vista in May, Norwegian Viva in August, and most recently, the highly anticipated Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November.  The successful launch of 3 vessels in 1 year would not have been possible without the hard work and unwavering commitment of crew and team members across the globe. Thanks to their dedication and passion for providing an unmatched guest experience, the reception for these new ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board.  This reception, combined with the strong demand environment, we continue to experience across all 3 of our brands, has enabled us to successfully absorb an 18% increase in capacity in 2023 versus 2019 levels at record pricing levels. As a result, we have driven revenue per passenger cruise day up 17%, allowing us to finish the year with year-end advanced ticket sales of $3.2 billion up an incredible 56% compared to 2019.  At the same time, we continue to maximize onboard revenue generation, as shown by growth onboard revenue per passenger cruise day, which is up 27% over 2019. A main driver of this large improvement is through enhanced presold onboard revenue, so our guests come on board with a fresh wallet. But none of this is new news. As we have been and continue to be the industry leader in net yields. We are proud of the work our teams do day in and day out to drive the highest yields in the industry. But today, I also want to emphasize that we are equally passionate about the cost side of the business.  Our relentless focus on cost optimization has produced 4 sequential quarters of year-over-year adjusted new -- of year-over-year adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day reduction with full year 2023 coming in 21% lower than the prior year. We achieved this by focusing our efforts on optimizing spend and investments across all areas of the business, from fuel to food and consumables and marketing. We are committed to continuing to optimize our margins by balancing products, revenue and cost considerations through better leveraging data and analytics to drive decision-making and accountability.  The net result of these healthy revenue and cost metrics allowed us to get back to driving results. As we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, allowing us to generate the adjusted free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet with the repayment of nearly $2 billion in debt.  On the product front, we are strategically enhancing the guest experience by identifying smart ROI-driven investments and decisions to profitably maximize guest satisfaction. Our recent success has been the rollout of Starlink high-speed Internet. We moved quickly and have been able to roll out this cutting-edge technology across half of our fleet since the spring of 2023 and expect to finish the full fleet by year-end this year.  In addition, to significantly elevating the guest experience aboard our ships, we've been focusing on improving the pre-cruise guest experience and better leveraging digital tools across all 3 of our brands. For example, we've been making improvements to our pre-cruise planning functionality at Norwegian to allow guests to book even more before they leave their homes, and we rolled out a flexible air program at Oceania, sharing an innovation which began at Norwegian earlier in the year. This innovation gives guests the few day window to deviate their air at the beginning and end of their cruise so they can have more time to explore and enjoy destinations before and after they sail with us, while at the same time, allowing us to spread air demand over multiple days and save costs, a true win-win for us and our guests. On the digital side, we recently launched the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur, and we continue to see strong adoption of the NCL mobile app, which reached record high guest usage in January. These improvements are not only resonating with our guests, giving them a better and more frictionless experience before, during and after their cruise, but are also generating positive returns.  Finally, we announced important interim sustainability commitments, announcing our target to reduce greenhouse gas intensity on a capacity a day basis by 10% by 2026 and by 25% by 2030 versus 2019 levels. The company is truly firing on all cylinders. These solid operational and financial results have laid the foundation for a strong 2024 and position us to deliver sustained profitable growth in the future and incredible vacation experiences to the millions of guests who sail with us every year. In addition to these priorities, a key cornerstone of our long-term strategy is delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial results. Our new build pipeline of 5 ships, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a capacity growth of 28% from 2023 to 2028 with a 5% CAGR over the period. Historically, capacity growth has led to outsized revenue and EBITDA growth and we expect this capacity growth to be no different and deliver meaningful top and bottom line growth.  We believe that these measured capacity additions will enable us to further enhance our long-term profitability and continue to significantly strengthen our balance sheet while providing guests new and innovative experiences.  Shifting our discussion to the current booking environment shown on Slide 8. We continue to experience strong and resilient customer demand across all 3 of our brands. The strong momentum we saw in 2023 has continued into 2024 with an all-time high book position and pricing buoyed by strong wave season demand. This has led to some of the best booking weeks in the company history, which began with successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions.  In general, we continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands and products. Let me walk you through some recent trends. First, close-in demand for Caribbean sailing is particularly strong prompting the redeployment of Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway from offering shoulder season full 2024 voyages in the med to offering Caribbean sailings from Port Canaveral and New Orleans, respectively, beginning in October.  As a result, our Caribbean capacity for the NCL brand is expected to increase by approximately 300 basis points in 2024 versus the prior year.  Our industry's advantage lies in our ability to redeploy our ships and adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. These changes demonstrate our team's responsiveness to our guests' preferences.  We have also seen demand return for sailings in Hawaii. While only accounting for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, these sailings are performing exceptionally well in 2024.  Next, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand continues to see exceptionally strong demand and our book position and pricing are higher than last year for all 4 quarters of 2024.  Oceania, Regent also continued to see strong demand across all geographies with the exception of redeployed voyages due to cancellations in the Middle East and Red Sea.  Turning to the Middle East. Last quarter, we made the preemptive decision to cancel all calls to Israel in 2024. And recently, we have announced the rerouting of our cruises sailing through the Red Sea for the rest of the year. As a reminder, just 1% and 4% of our capacity in Q1 and full year '24, respectively, was expected to dip in the broader Middle East region.  However, the Middle East represents a larger percentage of our capacity for our Oceania and Regent brands making up 12% and 8%, respectively.  We now have no calls in the region in 2024 and all replacement cruises have been or are in the process of being put on sale.  Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year. We expect healthy full year net yield growth of approximately 5.4% this year on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by improved occupancy and pricing strength. Onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with strength seen across the board, an encouraging indicator that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We are continuing to see strong demand for pre-cruise purchases which typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest cruise journey.  And while we have talked about our strong cost focus during 2023, we want to emphasize that this was not just a 1-year exercise for our team. Rather, it is a cultural shift in the way our entire company looks at cost to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible while delivering experiences our guests truly value. This company-wide focus should allow us to not only continue to reduce costs but even more importantly, create operating leverage to enhance profitability, which will be foundational for our long-term success.  Our recently established transformation office is allowing us to monitor and track these changes holding each area accountable for their initiatives. We believe this is apparent in our guidance where we expect our core cost to be flat in 2024 versus 2023.  In conclusion, our strong top line growth, combined with our continued focus on cost and margin enhancements are expected to drive 2024 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to grow by 18% and 76%, respectively, over last year. We are very excited about the future, and we plan to discuss our multiyear targets with the investment community in mid-May. We look forward to meeting with you all then.  With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2023 financial results, 2024 guidance, and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2023 and 2024 net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019 and 2023, respectively.  Let's begin with our fourth quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 11. Starting with the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing approximately 14.5% and net yield increasing approximately 8.6%. As discussed last quarter, Several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong growth we saw, including the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019 as well as a very strong close-in demand for Caribbean sailings.  Looking at costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $151 in the quarter marking our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement on this important metric. As expected, this included approximately $1 of certain nonrecurring net benefits realized in the quarter.  We have made significant progress streamlining our cost base during 2023, demonstrating our focus and commitment to our margin enhancement initiatives, and expect to continue this focus in 2024 and beyond.  Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $360 million, in line with guidance, while adjusted EPS was a loss of negative $0.18 slightly below guidance due to a $0.06 impact from FX below the line.  Overall, we were very pleased with the results we generated in the fourth quarter and full year. Strong top line growth combined with continued progress on reducing costs, enabled us to generate full year adjusted EBITDA just short of $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70. All of which drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion.  I am confident that our improved financial performance in 2023 has set the foundation for a solid 2024 and beyond. Moving on to expectations for '24. Our outlook for the first quarter and full year can be found on Slide 12. Starting with the full year, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, an 18% improvement versus 2023 with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to improve by almost 250 basis points.  Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $635 million with adjusted EPS expected at approximately $1.23, a 76% increase versus 2023.  Before I get into our top line expectations, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind for your models. First, given our strong expected net income growth for the year, shares related to our exchangeable notes are expected to be dilutive and are included in our share count for 2024. As a reminder, we must settle the exchangeable notes due in 2024 and 2025 in shares while both of our exchangeable notes due 2027 can be settled in cash or shares at our sole election. However, the accounting treatment requires we consider all notes as if they were settled in shares. As a result, we assume our full year 2024 average share count to be approximately 516 million.  Secondly, we successfully migrated our tax residency from the U.K. to Bermuda as of December 31, 2023, and we do not expect recently enacted Bermuda corporate income tax legislation to have a significant impact on our overall tax rate as this was already assumed in our planning.  Taking a closer look at the components of the outlook, occupancy is expected to be approximately 105%. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% inclusive of the headwinds from the outsized impact of the Middle East and Red Sea on our Oceania and Regent brands primarily in the second and fourth quarter.  For modeling purposes, our year yield growth will be highest in the first quarter as we are lapping lower load factors and a non-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we are seeing strong demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represents approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter.  For the remainder of the year, yield growth is expected to return to more normalized levels despite the pressure from the aforementioned Middle East and Red Sea headwinds.  Moving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year. This represents a 3.4% increase versus full year 2023, but -- which includes the incremental impact of more dry dock days in 2024. Excluding that impact, our core costs are essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. To put this in perspective, this effectively represents approximately $100 million of cost savings given our expected core inflation rate of around 3% for next year.  For modeling purposes, keep in mind that 2023 had less dry docks than normal as we took the opportunity to dry docks ships while they were out of service, this year we are returning to a more normalized dry dock schedule and expect roughly a 175 dry dock days in the year. This will impact adjusted cruise cost ex fuel by approximately 325 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $5 on a unit cost basis. This includes both the impact of dry dock costs and the related reduction of capacity days.  Excluding the impact of that, we expect full year adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel would be approximately $154 essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. Note that the timing of this impact is expected to be weighted more to the first half of the year, with approximately 2/3 of our dry dock days occurring in that period. This year we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to enhance margins and reduce costs. We are leaving no stone unturned and are continually identifying opportunities big and small across the business.  Our transformation office is running full speed ahead in identifying operating inefficiencies and operating -- and opportunities for improvement across all areas of our operating platform in order to enhance the acceleration of our margin recovery and related cash generation.  One key focus area for us has been optimizing both our fuel consumption and bunkering strategies. Fuel costs are one of our largest expense line items, and our teams have been hard at work at fostering partnerships with the likes of DNV on decarbonization and long term agreements with industry leader ABB to drive new opportunities to lower our fuel consumption per capacity day.  In addition to the consumption side of the equation we have made a big leap in the optimization of our fuel bunkering strategy that allows us to maximize price leverage across the various ports and suppliers we use during a season and in many cases even during a single voyage. We believe this will drive double-digit millions in savings in the first year alone. This is just one of the many examples that support our relentless drive to improve our unit costs and leverage our scale all without impacting the guest experience. I look forward to sharing many more tangible examples at our upcoming Investor Day in May.  The combination of our more efficient cost structure and strong expected top line growth for the year is expected to drive the expansion of our full year adjusted EBITDA margins up by approximately 250 basis points. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. As I said earlier, net yield is strong in the first quarter and is expected to increase approximately 15.5%. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to be $165 or approximately 3% versus the same quarter last year.  As mentioned, we expect an increase in dry dock days in the quarter, which will have a $6 or a 350 basis point impact on adjusted net cruise cost in Q1. Excluding that impact, adjusted net cruise costs would be $159, essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the impact of inflation with our cost savings.  As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $450 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.12. Given the quarter is essentially complete, we do not expect significant outperformance in the top line versus expectations as the vast majority of our inventory is already sold. Any limited upside would result from our onboard revenue generating performance during the month of March.  Moving on to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. In 2023, we generated almost $2 billion of net cash from operating activities, which included $500 million return of cash collateral. And we repaid $1.9 billion of debt, including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving loan facility. Most recently, we successfully negotiated a refinancing of our $650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. And in connection with this refinancing $250 million 9.75 secured notes due in 2028, our highest interest rate debt is expected to be repaid. This refinancing, which is expected to close in early March will reduce interest expense, improve leverage while also releasing all of the related collateral, another important step forward in improving our balance sheet.  Moving to leverage on Slide 15. The company has a solid track record of delevering the balance sheet. From 2014 to 2019, we successfully delevered by over 3 turns. We will continue to be opportunistic and look for further ways to strengthen our balance sheet. We are confident we can make meaningful progress on this front going forward. At year-end '23, with reported net leverage of approximately 7.3x or approximately 6.75x when excluding the impact of ships delivered in the second half of the year. We continue to expect significant improvement in this metric over time, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments. Over the course of 2024, we expect to reduce our reported leverage by almost 1.5 turns with sequential improvements in each quarter.  This improvement does not assume any prepayment of debt, apart from the aforementioned takeout of our $250 million notes expected in early March. Going forward, we are refining a multiyear plan to further accelerate the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet in order to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks. Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Mark. Truly encouraging results. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on the most important work. First, we will continue to execute on our near-term priorities and capitalize on the strong demand from cruising from our target upscale demographic. Second, we will build upon the progress we've already made with our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in costs. And finally, we will continue to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage over time. In closing, I couldn't be more excited about the year ahead. I am confident that we have the right resources in place to capitalize on the strong demand environment and deliver exceptional vacation experiences for our guests across all 3 of our brands, execute on our operational and financial goals for 2024 and ultimately deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder value.  I look forward to share you the results of our strategic assessment of our business and defining our vision for the future of the company, including long-term financial targets at our Investor Day this coming May. With that, I'm happy to turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Brandt Montour of Barclays. Brandt Montour : So looking at your 1Q guidance and the full year net yield guidance, there obviously is a pretty big decel or sort of a more conservative implied growth in the back -- in the sort of 2Q through 4Q net yield. But it's not out of line with your longer-term algo on that 2Q to 4Q. So I guess the question is, one, would you be willing to, Mark, or Harry willing to sort of quantify the disruption from the Middle East and the repositioning of those ships and sort of give us a sense for what the core business outside of those disruptions, how you see that sort of growing in the back half of the year? Harry Sommer : Yes. Thank you, Brandt, again, for that. So I do think you have the right thought pattern. Q2 to Q4 are in line with our long-term express goals where we look to have low to mid-single-digit yield growth, of course, measured capacity growth, strong cost controls, all leading to outsized EBITDA and margin performances, which should allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet.  I think you are right that the situation in the Red Sea, Suez Canal had some impact on our Oceania, Regent brand, not on NCL.  NCL is extraordinarily strong in all 4 quarters, as we see the booking patterns now. But for the Oceania and Regent perspective, since it was 8% and 12% of their respective capacities, we would expect that to have an impact of about 1 to 2 points on yield in the back 3 quarters of the year. What that means, all that's taken into consideration in the guidance we provided. So we stand by our numbers. And what that means is we should have a modest tailwind in 2025 when those -- when we less those items. Brandt Montour : That's super helpful. That's great. And then as a follow-up, taking the Middle East disruption -- direct disruption out of it and just thinking about core Europe sailings, core Norwegian-branded Europe sailings, Americans traveling to Europe. That's an area that people -- that some of us have been a little bit more concerned about. Maybe talk about the evolution of the bookings patterns you're seeing in that specific segment? And should we be taking that into account when we think about the cadence for the 3Q? Harry Sommer : We talked last year a little bit about some of the challenges we had coming out of COVID with some of our itineraries that require a slightly longer booking period like Europe. And I think that had impacted some of our results in Q3 or Q4 of last year -- I'm sorry, Q2 or Q3 of last year, my apologies, when we gave the results in our earnings calls. We learned from that, and we've absolutely extended our booking curve for Europe, primarily for Americans going into the 2024 season. So we're very happy with what we're seeing across all 3 brands, with the exception of those cruises that had previously been going to Israel and the Middle East on the Oceania, Regent brand. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Harry, I guess, just when I think about the visibility into the first half of '24 and maybe for the full year, just curious how kind of your booking curve has changed over the years. And I think Mark spoke about 1Q, obviously, being fully booked here. Kind of where do you stand in terms of 2Q being booked at this point? And how should we think about where you stand for full year '24 based on your budgeted capacity. Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Andrew, for that question. We don't give specific guidance on our book position for each quarter. Yes, Mark did say we are entirely booked for Q1 because we're sitting here on February -- late February, February 27. So we're not going to get any more meaningful bookings for Q1. But for the other 3 quarters, we continue to be with the exception of those Red Sea and Middle East Cruises, which I referred to before, in record booked positions where we're referring to as all-time high booked positions across the 3 quarters and especially on the NCL brand. Andrew Didora : Okay. And Mark, just on the balance sheet. Obviously, you're addressing the expense of 2028 maturity. I guess I thought you couldn't prepay debt before all the deferred amortizations, you can also kind of proactively pay down? I know it's not in your assumptions, but just curious if it's possible or is it just too costly to do at this point? Mark Kempa : Andrew, you're right. Technically, we do not have the capability to technically prepay debt until we have all of our deferred amortization cut up. However, with this particular transaction, it is deemed a refinancing and as such, we do have the ability to take out that portion of the debt.  As we look forward over the course of the remainder of the year of '24, we do have some notes that are maturing in December $565 million, 3.625% notes which are very cost effective, but we will be looking to address those between now and sometime obviously, well before the end of the year.  And then outside of that, a little bit too early for us to be thinking about or giving guidance in terms of what we may or may not take out. But I think the point to be made here really is that we are now starting to actively address the balance sheet and address the leverage.  And we've always said this will be a little bit of a chip away each year, and we're happy that coming out of the gate for 2024, we've been able to start that. So we're very excited about that. It's definitely a solid path to -- in our journey. Operator : The next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So Harry or Mark, first off, congratulations on the cost improvement. It's been pretty impressive. And as we move through this year and we think about costs then for the out years, I mean, how do you guys think about cost growth or lack of cost growth in those as we move past 2024. I mean, I would assume it's going to be tough to keep cost in that flattish range. So just maybe some color around your long-term cost outlook moving forward would be helpful. Harry Sommer : So thank you, Steve, for those the kind words on cost control. It's something that we're extraordinarily proud of, and as Mark mentioned in his prepared comments, represents over $100 million improvement versus core inflation. Listen, I -- we're not here to give specific guidance yet on '25 and '26, so we won't. We'll do that in -- we give our long-term financial metric outlook in our Investor Day in May.  But I will say that this goal of being able to grow cost at less than the rate of inflation is certainly something that we inspire to do on a long-term basis. So I know that's not exactly what you're looking for, but hopefully gives you some indication of our direction. Mark Kempa : And Steve, to just further highlight what Harry is saying is I want to make it very clear. We've been laser-focused on this. We are looking at all different ways how we can improve and more importantly, improve and get more efficient to leverage our scale. We've said time and again, this is not a onetime exercise. This is what we've actually established a transformation office, which I imagine will become something like a continuous improvement office. But things -- we're setting up performance dashboards. I talked about some of our bunkering strategies.  There's a lot of ways where we can improve the overall underlying fundamental cost structure, all without impacting the guest experience. I talked about our fuel, I talked about our bunkering strategy, food waste. Food waste is just a big area that when you start really monitoring the waste side of it, has significant upstream benefits when you think about the waste side of it.  So again, we're focused on this. We got the message. We've been taking this serious. And we believe there's multiyear benefits here, but we look forward to certainly sharing more details around that in our May Investor Day. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And then second question, you mentioned in the release that pricing and bookings are higher for the Norwegian brand for all 4 quarters of this year. Just wondering if you can give a little bit more color about what you're seeing in terms of what kind of price action you can take for more second half of this year into 2025. And then maybe also a little bit of color around the luxury brands, which obviously are being somewhat impacted by what's going on in the Med, but any color there would be helpful as well. Harry Sommer : Yes. So listen, on the NCL brand, we have very robust and sophisticated revenue management systems. And when we see demand as it is today, we take price action or promotional action, which is sort of an opaque way to take price action in order to generate the highest yields for the company, and we're doing that.  So nothing has changed in our core philosophy from that perspective. When demand is good, we take advantage of it. And I think it's reflected in our oversized gains for Q1 and our reasonably strong gains for Q2 to Q4, especially on the NCL brand.  In Oceania, Regent, I want to be clear, there's something fundamentally wrong with the model at the luxury space. We see demand for luxury being very high. But when you have to take 60 or 70 days out of service on 2 ships out of a regularly small fleet for 2 brands, it does have an outsized impact on the ability to grow yield at those 2 brands.  We hope that to be a onetime thing. All the new voyages for Oceania, Regent, with the new deployment already on sale and starting to fill, well albeit because we're filling them closer in it at lower pricing than we normally would have gotten, but it's just limited to those areas. We are very happy with the performance on Oceania and Regent, in the other regions of the world. Mark Kempa : And Steve, in terms of the Norwegian brand, not apart from our sophisticated revenue management systems, let's not forget our models around onboard revenue. We are in a continuous improvement mode in terms of expanding our presale of onboard revenue and getting more share of the wallet over a longer period of time from the point a customer enters our ecosystem. And we continue to refine that. We continue to look at that. And that plays a key part as we -- going forward as we look at our revenue opportunity. So that's something we are very, very focused on. Operator : The next question is coming from Daniel Politzer of Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper, just make sure I'm understanding your comments in terms of how you're thinking about the yield growth for this year. So the Middle East, it sounds like the impact is largest in the second quarter and the fourth quarter. So is it fair to assume the third quarter in terms of the yield growth, first quarter, third quarter and then 2Q, 4Q about the same in terms of greatest to least? Harry Sommer : Yes, Dan, certainly, when you look at the impact of the Middle East on the O&R brands, it's definitely impacting us more in the second and fourth quarter, as mentioned in our results. So I think as you look across the 3 quarters, as we said in our prepared remarks, you're going to see more of a normalized consistent yield growth. There's always some puts and takes within each quarter, but I wouldn't expect any significant lumpiness necessarily, so to speak, across the remaining 3 quarters. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then just for my follow-up, this is maybe an add-on to Brandt's question. But as we think about that second quarter to fourth quarter and kind of getting back to a more normal algo, I think, Harry, you mentioned geopolitical was maybe 1 or 2 points of a headwind. But I think you've also been pretty adamant that you guys were going to guide a fairly conservative outlook for the year. So I guess as we think about that, the 2Q through fourth quarter outlook, like to what degree you're baking in conservatism and any impact from itinerary mix shifts? Harry Sommer : I think if we told you what level of conservatism we are baking into our guidance, I wouldn't be giving you new guidance. So listen, suffice to say that we are providing the numbers that we're confident in. We have, of course, incredible visibility into future book positions. So I'm not saying there's no upside there, but I certainly wouldn't expect huge upside to the numbers that we've provided. We're going to manage our business to the best of our abilities, and we're providing you numbers that we are confident that we can hit. Operator : The next question is coming from James Hardiman of Citi. James Hardiman : Thanks for taking my call. So I don't want to belabor the point, but just this sort of this dichotomy between 1Q and the rest of the year on the yield front. Obviously, some of that is just occupancy, right, that catch up. But if I think about, what I get to is being maybe 800 to 900 basis point detail from 1Q to the rest of the year.  How much can just be explained by mix, right? I mean you've got the slide that shows Europe going from 0% to 34% and 51%, while the Caribbean is coming down from 58% to 18%. Obviously, Caribbean pricing is a lot more robust than what we're seeing out of Europe. Is there any way to quantify how much of that decel just stems from that? And I guess is there a way to think about sort of how you're seeing like-for-like pricing in North America and Europe as we get past the first quarter and into the rest of the year? Harry Sommer : James, I appreciate the question as always. Listen, I don't think there's really much of a mix issue here from the perspective that our deployment in 2024 is not that much different than our deployment in 2023 with the exception of the couple of big NCL ships that we moved out of Europe a month or 2 early in early Q4.  So I wouldn't necessarily say to Q4-ish, right? I think there's 2 primary issues that we've discussed, which I'm happy to articulate, Q1 of '23 was particularly weak, coming out of COVID, there was short booking curves. There were disruptions, especially on the Oceania and Regent brand with our itineraries that visited Asia, Australia. Both those brands have world crews, which was very difficult to sell, given the time commitment that gets past to make and the fact that they would have had to make those decisions in early '22 when COVID was still alive and well. So we're coming off a reasonably weak comp in Q1.  That being said, we're still very, very happy that we were able to get Q1 of '24 back to where it is with a 16% growth year-over-year. So obviously, there's some spend in Q1. It's not of this year, not just the weakness of last year. I think the other 3 quarters, the only issue that we're seeing when we look across the brands, across the quarters, across the geographic areas, it's simply this issue with the Red Sea and Suez, which I want to elaborate because I talked to it before. We believe we have the right mix of Caribbean product for our guest set over the summer. We do have ships in the Caribbean. We don't go to a 0% capacity, but we have seen higher returns out of Europe and Alaska and Bermuda than we do out of the Caribbean, which is why we position our ships there. So it's possible that the growth in the Caribbean could have been more, but the end result would have been less. I repeat what I said in my prepared remarks, we still have the highest net yields within the competitive set. So maybe we would have grown more on a like-for-like basis, but it would have resulted in a lower overall number if we positioned more of our capacity in the Caribbean. Mark Kempa : And James, just keep in mind, when you think about 2024, Obviously, we're getting the benefit in Q1 versus Q1 of '23 an outsized growth algo because of the aforementioned factors. But then you roll that forward and you look at Q4 of 2023, where we had roughly 8.5%, 9% yield growth, we're going to be lapping over that in the fourth quarter of this year. So there is a little bit of lapping issues going on. But I think as Harry said, the underlying strength in pricing in the business is looking good across all sectors and all geopolitical areas, I'm sorry, all geographical areas, apart from the Middle Sea and the Red Sea area. James Hardiman : Got it. And maybe just a follow-up there to that geographical point. So if I just think about 5.5, call it, yield growth for the year, I guess that's probably if we just thought about pricing, right, ex the occupancy piece maybe 4Q, call it, is there ex the Red Sea and the Middle East impact, is there a meaningful difference in terms of how we're thinking -- we should be thinking about pricing growth for Europe versus pricing growth for the Caribbean, but maybe not. Harry Sommer : I don't think there's any meaningful difference between the markets, James. I think we're -- again, we're seeing strong pricing for all those markets and other markets. So obviously, you have a total difference in net per diem depending on the area of operation. But in terms of growth, we're not seeing any sort of significant differences between markets. James Hardiman : Got it. Very helpful. and good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : I wanted to dig into the margin a little bit helpful, your color on, I think, close to 2.5 points of improvement that gets you back to about the mid-20s, but there's still a handful of points behind where you were pre-COVID. And maybe you could help walk through some of those moving pieces.  I think selling more air is probably just a headwind as it's more of a pass-through. I think that fuel is probably a point or so of headwind. But just help us kind of understand and bridge the margin differential versus pre-COVID times and get your confidence on a path back to getting close to something near 30% over time? Mark Kempa : Yes. Thanks, Vince. While I don't want to give too many details because I think we're going to give some significant visibility at our May Investor Day. But look, the bottom line is really that we have to continue to improve on our pricing. That's key number one. But it all comes down to leveraging our cost base and our unit cost and leveraging that scale.  We've made significant progress, what I would say in the last 18 to 20 months when we really first started addressing this back in the second half of 2022. So we're going to continue to look at that. We have to improve. When you think about overall cost from 2019, when we look at it, I think we were somewhere about a 3% CAGR over 2019 through 2024 guidance. So we think we can definitely improve on that. Obviously, there is some incremental drag from fuel given new regulations versus '19 and '24 and so on. But we have to do a better job of leveraging our scale. We're doing that. As I've said, we've been able to confidently mitigate over $100 million of expected inflation in 2024. It's no small feat that I want to reiterate, when we look at our cost base, excluding the dry dock and the reduced capacity days, our cost base is flat, expected to be flat for 2024.  So I want to make sure everybody understands that. It doesn't end here. We're looking at everything and we think there's continuous opportunity there. So we're going to chip away at that. And I think in a combination between, again, strong top line growth and moderate cost growth or improvement, we think definitely there's opportunity for significant margin expansion over time. Harry Sommer : And just to add to that, I know we talk a lot about metrics, NCC excluding fuel, or NCC excluding fuel and dry dock, but I want to emphasize that fuel expense is not something we ignore. Mark talked about it extensively in his prepared remarks. And our goal is to find ways to reduce consumption. Ultimately, obviously, that's great for our sustainability goals, but it's also great for our overall profitability.  So I don't want to -- despite the fact that we don't necessarily report on that metric extensively, I want to assure everyone that is one of the main focuses. I mean we spend something like $700 million a year on fuel, and Mark talked about the multi-, multi-, multi-million dollar things that we're going to do to improve fuel from bunkering to better monitoring and things like that. And those numbers are real and of course, are reflected in our EBITDA numbers. Vince Ciepiel : And then maybe one more for thinking about this kind of more normalized yield growth 2Q through 4Q. And maybe walk us through how you envision onboard versus ticket versus occupancy gains kind of contributing to that growth? And if it's equal, if one is a bigger driver? Any additional color there would be helpful. Mark Kempa : Yes. Look, onboard revenue is always a significant generator of our overall revenue profile. When you look at the quarters 2 through 4, yes, I think we're getting probably, what, about 1.5 points of occupancy benefit in those 3 quarters, and the rest is really coming on the back of pricing.  So on board is an important component, it always is, and it always has been. We'll continue to improve on that. Our goal, again, is to get more of that wallet share well prior to the customer over stepping on foot any one of our vessels. And we continue to improve on that. And that -- but I don't think there's going to -- I don't think we're expecting any meaningful outsized growth from that particular revenue stream versus necessarily our core ticket price across the 3 brands. Harry Sommer : Donna, I think we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : Maybe if I could just sneak two in. Just on the cost trajectory in 2024. Trying to understand a little bit more. I understand the dry docks and the inflation, but it's -- what's the offset that's happening there? Is marketing spend kind of trending down?  And maybe secondly to stick with Mark on that as well. The comments around the balance sheet improvement, the tone is definitely changing. So that's positive. Simple maths as you're going to 6x leverage. Are we going to get back to this 3x to 4x that you did pre-COVID? Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Harry Sommer : Yes. So I'll let Mark talk about our balance sheet number because we're very proud of that. And I'll let him finish up the commentary on that. But on the cost side, this isn't specifically related to marketing. We obviously will look at improvements in efficiencies and marketing in the same way we look at efficiencies everywhere else. But any improvement we find in marketing will be strictly around efficiency, the volume, if you will, of marketing will remain the same. We're very happy with the demand we drive. We carefully track it through web visits, lead generation and all the other type of metrics that are necessary in order to keep both top and mid-funnel our marketing alive and well, and that volume will continue. Any benefit we have will be on efficiency, not on volume. But really, the cost is everywhere. I mean, we talked about fuel, we talked about food waste. But I mean we could go through every line item of the P&L. There is nothing off the table. I mean we've made improvements in air costs. We made improvements in our consumables and maintenance, really across the way in SG&A expenses. So I really want you to think about it as a whole P&L and not that we're going to, in any way, focus on marketing in order to reduce those important demand metrics. And Mark take it away. Mark Kempa : Conor on leverage. Look, we've said we are very focused on it. And we've said that this will improve significantly over time. We're very excited that we expect our leverage -- current leverage levels at year-end. We expect to at least decrease that by 1.5 turns. And again, that's going to -- that's slowly but surely restoring our balance sheet back to pre-COVID levels.  So obviously, that 3% to 4% range is something we're focused on. I would not -- certainly would not expect that to happen in 2024, but we are starting the sequential improvement quarter after quarter. This year, you will see significant improvements in leverage. And we're excited to see that same thing happening over the course of '25 and '26.  So we're on the right path. Harry Sommer : The only thing I'll add to Mark's comment is just a simple math one. If we were at 7.3%, and we plan to reduce it by 1.5%, I think the number would be in the 5-something range, not the 6-something range just to keep that in the back of your mind.  That being said, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around to answer any questions you may have. We look forward to seeing you all in May. We wish you a great day and all the best. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Joe, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inman. Ms. Inman, please proceed. Sarah Inman : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. Throughout the call, we will refer to a slide presentation that can be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2024 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry? Harry Sommer : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. It's such an exciting time for our company with wonderful new products available across all 3 of our award-winning brands, strong demand and some recent noteworthy announcements that have solidified our trajectory for years to come.  The demand for cruise vacations continues to be at all-time high, as evidenced by record booking, record book position and record advanced ticket sales as the continued innovation and service delivery on board our ships lead to exceptional guest satisfaction scores. The combined effect is strong financial performance in the quarter and an even brighter outlook for the year ahead. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our Q1 milestones, including the recent newbuild ship announcement and pier development, our strong performance in the quarter and the exciting booking trends that are driving our improved guidance for the remainder of 2024. I'll also be diving into the significant progress we've made on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our first quarter performance and updated guidance for 2024. We kicked off the year with impressive momentum carrying forward several positive trends from the end of 2023. As you can see on Slide 4, we sustained strong demand throughout the quarter, achieving record bookings in this period, which led to our most successful WAVE season ever. As a result, our 12-month forward book position remains at all-time high. In terms of financial results, adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled during the first quarter compared to last year on the back of stronger pricing and higher occupancy levels. Our margins also noticeably improved during the period, with our core costs essentially flat year-over-year, leading to a robust growth in adjusted operational EBITDA margin, which is adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted gross margin now approaching 33% for the trailing 12 months. As a result, we reduced our leverage by a full turn during the quarter when compared to the end of 2023, ending the first quarter at 6.3x net leverage, marking an important milestone in our journey to strengthen our balance sheet and well on our path for the 1.5 turn improvement in net leverage we guided for the year. These strides were recognized by S&P, which upgraded both our issuer credit rating and issue-level ratings during the quarter. While we'll give more details later in the call, I can't help but share that we have exceeded essentially all of our guidance metrics for the first quarter of 2024 and consequently raised guidance on our key metrics for the full year, including net yield, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Another key milestone during the first quarter was our historic newbuild order, which we shared on our last conference call during Seatrade Cruise Global. Encompassing 8 new ships across all 3 of our award-winning brands, this is the most transformative newbuild program in our company's history. We also announced the construction of the 2-ship pier at Great Stirrup Cay, which will enhance our existing infrastructure on the private island making it an even more attractive destination for our guests. I am thrilled about our future as I know we're paving the way for our continued growth in the next decade and beyond. Our first quarter successes are due to our continued focus on our near-term priorities, which are detailed on Slide 5. We successfully grew capacity 8% compared to 2023, while achieving a record 12-month forward book position, all while increasing price and reducing our net leverage by a full turn, and we're seeing strong results across the board. Turning to Slide 6. We have shown you frequently in the past, I want to once again emphasize our long-term strategy of delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial returns. Our newbuild pipeline increased from 5 to 13 ships in the quarter, representing a capacity CAGR of 6% from 2023 to 2028 and 4% from 2023 to 2036. Historically, capacity growth has driven outsized revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, and we expect this trend to continue with the incorporation of larger and more efficient state-of-the-art vessels to our fleet. Turning our attention to the current booking environment shown on Slide 7 and we are witnessing robust and resilient consumer demand across all 3 of our brands in all of our markets. As a result, during the first quarter of this year, we noted record bookings culminating a record wave season, leading to a continued record book position for the next 12 months, extending into 2025. We continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands and products, including Europe and Alaska, which continue to perform very well and make up the majority of our deployment over the summer. All of this strength is despite the cancellation and rerouting of our itineraries that we announced in the Middle East and Red Sea earlier this year. We also recently announced the cancellation of all Red Sea sailings across all 3 of our brands for the spring of 2025 and replacement sailings are already on sale. By adjusting these sailings well in advance, we can ensure a full sales cycle for the replacement itineraries and no impact to our 2025 yield. Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for the next 12 months, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, yield growth is strong. During the first quarter, yield growth exceeded guidance coming in at 16.2% on a constant currency basis, up 70 basis points from the guidance we provided just 2 months ago in late February. 2024 is shaping up to be a strong year. And as a result, we are raising our full year yield guidance 100 basis points from 5.4% to approximately 6.4% on a constant currency basis on the back of the strong first quarter and strong demand for the remainder of 2024. Please note that our occupancy guidance remains unchanged as we are essentially already guiding to full ships. So the entire increase in our guidance is on the back of stronger pricing. Onboard revenue also remains a highlight with strength seen across the board. This is a positive sign that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We continue to absorb strong demand from pre-cruise purchases, which were up 16% compared to 2023. Preselling of packages of [ 4 cruise ] typically leads to a higher overall spending during a guest's cruise journey. Turning to Slide 8. To continue cementing our leading industry position beyond 2024, I'm excited to announce that this first quarter reached an all-time high in advanced ticket sales. This success was driven by robust pricing, a dynamic deployment mix, coupled with increased presale packages and capacity growth. Our advance ticket sales balance rose 13% year-on-year, reaching a record $3.8 billion. Over the past quarter, we have taken considerable strides in our sustainability efforts through our Sail & Sustain program, which you can see on Slide 9. We kicked off the year seeking out government grants to support our green initiatives by applying to the EU innovation fund with the goal of accelerating the transition of our 6 Prima class vessels for being methanol ready to be fully methanol capable. We continue to be committed to our short- and long-term decarbonization goals. We're also proud to announce that 50% of our company-wide fleet is now equipped with shoreside technology, achieving our year-end 2024 target well ahead of schedule. This is key to our journey to minimizing emissions during port stays and contributing to cleaner air in the port communities we visit. Our proactive approach to environmental impacts didn't go unnoticed. CDP Climate gave us a notable B rating in recognition of the steps we've taken to measure and manage our risks and opportunities related to climate change. This acknowledgment endorses our efforts and pushes us to continue enhancing our sustainability initiatives. Our commitment to operating ethically and with integrity also gained us recognition in the equity markets, JUST Capital in their restaurant and leisure category of America's most JUST Companies Index named us as a top 5 company. This recognition is a testament to our dedication to fair and equitable operations and the prioritization of our stakeholders' wellbeing. Also, we completed the purchase of 3 million carbon offsets invested in renewable energy products. These offsets not only support our decarbonization journey, but invest in cleaner energy sources and local job creation in the communities where these projects are located. Finally, we were recently honored with being one of Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity in 2024. This award is a testament to our dedicated efforts in fostering an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to generate and execute on innovative ideas. I want to express my gratitude to our entire team for their efforts in making our company a welcoming place for all of our talented team members. This recognition motivates us to continue creating a workplace where every individual feels valued and empowered. This progress underscores our unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability, ethical business practices and the well-being of all of our stakeholders. These accomplishments serve as building blocks in our ongoing journey towards a more sustainable and responsible future. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team for all of these impressive accomplishments. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mr. Kempa? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. I'm a little under the weather today, so if my voice cracks, I apologize in advance. My commentary today will focus on our strong first quarter 2024 financial results, our improved full year 2024 guidance and our increasingly solid financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2024 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Let's begin with our first quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 10. We had an exceptional start to the year, and we exceeded guidance across the board, beating our already ambitious targets for the first quarter, which we only announced 2 months ago. Starting with the top line. Results were impressive with net yield increasing 16.2%, materially exceeding our guidance of 15.5%. As discussed last quarter, several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong top line growth we saw this quarter, including the lapping of lower load factors and a less-than-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. But more importantly, we experienced unprecedented demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represented approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter. Looking at costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, came in slightly below guidance at $164. As expected, this number includes approximately $5 from the increased dry-dock days and related costs in the quarter compared to 2023. Excluding the impact of dry docks, our adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel, would have been essentially flat year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to offset the impacts of inflation with our disciplined cost savings initiatives across the organization. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $464 million, exceeding guidance of $450 million and almost doubling the prior year's results. We returned to first quarter profitability with adjusted EPS of $0.16, exceeding guidance of $0.12 in the quarter and well above the loss of $0.30 in the prior year. Overall, we are incredibly pleased with the results we generated in the first quarter. Strong top line growth, combined with continued progress in reducing costs, allowed us to essentially beat all of our guidance metrics in the quarter. We are building on this momentum and with our revised expectations for 2024 are raising our full year guidance on several metrics, which can be seen on Slide 11.  We raised our full year net yield growth a full percentage point from 5.4% to approximately 6.5%. This 100 basis point increase reflects the strength we experienced in the first quarter, but more importantly, our higher expectations through the rest of the year as a result of strong demand and record bookings that we have experienced for the remainder of 2024. Last quarter, we mentioned the impact on our business due to cancellations and redeployment of itineraries in the Middle East and Red Sea. The strength we have seen in the business through WAVE season, however, has allowed us to almost fully offset this impact. Our full year guidance implies net yield growth for the remainder of the year in the low to mid-single-digit range and is exceeding our prepandemic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year increased $50 million to $2.5 billion building on the first quarter guidance beat of $14 million. Adjusted EPS guidance for the year increased on a net basis of $0.09 to $1.32, made up of our $0.04 beat in the first quarter, a $0.10 raise for the balance of the year due to higher demand and pricing, which was partially offset by higher fuel costs and interest expense of approximately $0.04. These strong numbers and related guidance raise would not be possible without the continued focus and efforts from our entire team, both shoreside and shipboard. Now let's take a look at our guidance for the second quarter. We expect a strong second quarter with net yield growth expected to increase approximately 4.3%, which is slightly above our historical averages despite the impacts of the canceled itineraries and redeployments in the Middle East and Red Sea. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 5.8% above the same quarter last year. As we mentioned last quarter, dry-dock days in 2024 will make comparisons to prior year more challenging. Second quarter '24 has approximately 70 more dry-dock days scheduled than last year. This increase for the quarter results in a $9 or 550 basis point impact on an adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel in the quarter. Excluding the dry-dock impact, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be approximately $156, essentially flat year-over-year, demonstrating once more the continued success of our cost savings initiatives across the organization. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $555 million, adjusted net income is expected to be about $160 million and adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.32. Moving to Slide 12. I want to dive a bit deeper into our margin enhancement initiatives.  We remain fully committed to boosting margins and reducing costs across the organization. With a meticulous approach supported by our transformation office, we are continuously pinpointing opportunities irrespective of their scale across every facet of our business. The results of these efforts are clear in the first quarter of 2024 where adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day was $165 but was flat -- essentially flat compared to the first quarter in 2023, excluding the dry-dock impact. Our guidance on adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel remains unchanged for the full year 2024 and is expected to be $159, net of the approximate $5 impact from dry-docks in the full year, which are -- ex the dry-docks, which are essentially expected to be flat. For your models, I would remind you that we expect to see about 2/3 of the dry-dock impact during the first half of the year with the remainder in the fourth quarter. Turning over to Slide 13. I want to focus on an important metric that we track internally, which is our adjusted operational EBITDA margin which is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by adjusted gross margin. Looking at the last 12 months, you can see the significant improvements we have made as we have returned the business to full operations and focused on rightsizing our cost basis. In Q1, trailing 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin was 32.7%, improving 200 basis points compared to the full year 2023. We expect to see this margin continue to improve throughout the year, ending 2024 at approximately 33.5% based on our updated guidance. As you know, we are striving to improve our margins, and this journey will be fueled by 2 main drivers : First, capitalizing on the strong demand in the market, and converting this into quality and sustainable net yield growth; and second, continued focus on net cruise costs and rightsizing our cost base. Shifting to the balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. During the quarter, we completed the refinancing of our $650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. In connection with this refinancing, we repaid $250 million 9.75% secured notes due in 2028, which was our highest interest rate debt. This refinancing reduces our interest expense and improved leverage while also releasing all related collateral, another important step forward in strengthening our balance sheet. Moving to leverage on Slide 15. We have a track record of delivering on net leverage reduction, as we have discussed in many previous earnings calls, and we are currently on a path to do so again. In the first quarter alone, we reduced our net leverage by a full turn from year-end and turned the quarter at 6.3x. This is a significant reduction for one quarter, and we expect to continue to improve net leverage over time propelled by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments. By the end of 2024, we anticipate reducing our net leverage by approximately 1.5 turns from year-end 2023, ending 2024 in the upper 5x range, with sequential improvements in each quarter. We are currently refining a multiyear plan to further continue the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet to drive shareholder value. I plan to share more on this plan at our Investor Day on May 20. Closing out my section, I want to reiterate, this has been a fantastic quarter, where we beat guidance on all key metrics. The strong momentum we have seen in the quarter is carrying over to the full year, and we've been able to raise our guidance for the full year on yield, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. This quarter is a testament to our ability to use strong top line results, coupled with efficiencies to enhance margins and drive strong EBITDA and related cash flows, resulting in lower leverage and derisking the balance sheet. We are excited to see how the rest of the year plays out after the strong start. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks. Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Mark, and I wish you a speed of recovery. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on our most important work, as shown on Slide 16. First, we will continue to focus on execution, capitalizing on the strong demand from our target upskill demographics to drive net yield while delivering experiences that guests value. . Second, we will build upon the progress already made over the last quarters from our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in cost reduction and efficiencies throughout the organization.  And finally, we will continue to improve our financial stability by further strengthening our balance sheet and continuing to reduce net leverage over time. In a few weeks' time, we will be having the privilege of hosting an Investor Day. We hope you are able to attend either in person at the New York Stock Exchange or virtually through our webcast. It is an occasion that we are eagerly looking forward to as it provides us with a platform to articulate our long-term strategy and financial metrics for the business. This strategic road map will offer insight into our ambitions and aspirations for the future of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We will outline the key initiatives and measures that will underpin our drive towards providing our guests with the experiences they value while delivering long-term profitable growth and shareholder value. The future is certainly bright, and we are excited to share this journey with you. And with that, I'll hand the call back to the operator to begin our Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : I was hoping we could dive in a little bit more on kind of the pricing and set up for the remainder of the year. I mean it seems certainly the first quarter was very strong. As we think about the tweaks to your capacity allocation for the rest of 2024 and certainly similar Europe and at least in the second quarter, but kind of falling off in the back half. How should we think about the relationship between that capacity allocation relative to pricing? And put more simplistically, can you maybe classify the pockets where you're seeing outsized strength versus maybe a little bit more modest strength in terms of pricing? Harry Sommer : So Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Listen, I wouldn't say that there are any areas that are outsized or undersized. We're seeing good pricing yield strength across all 3 of our brands, across all the major areas that we deploy our ships. We're doing well in Europe, we're doing well in Alaska, Bermuda, Hawaii, of course, the Caribbean. I think the only place where we've talked before, where we had a little bit of a challenge is the voyages in Q2 and Q4 that had previously visited the Red Sea and had to redeploy to other itineraries. But outside of those, we're seeing broad-based demand across the board. We're very happy with our yield growth in the back 3 quarters. As we discussed, both Mark and myself, we're increasing our yield guidance by a full point, which I think underscores the strengths that we're seeing. We continue to be at record book positions, record pricing. We're very happy with where we are. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then just pivoting to the cost side. Can you just remind us a couple of those pockets where you really seem to be cutting the fat, right? I think food is an area where you've seen some success. Also I think on marketing, you've talked about the expenses you've cut there. So as we think about the kind of the buckets across the cost structure, where have you seen more success? And where is kind of the additional opportunity that you see looking ahead? Mark Kempa : Dan, it's Mark. So first, I just want to clarify. I wouldn't classify it as cutting the fat, so to speak. That's probably a little bit too generous. We're really looking at how we can get much more efficient across the entire organization. As I mentioned in our -- in our prior earnings call, the first big piece of that was really reducing -- looking at our fuel and bunkering processes. And if I recall correctly, I said that was the double-digit million savings, and that's actually reflected in our latest fuel guidance where if you think about -- if you look at the curves, the curves were up anywhere from mid-to-upper single digits. Yet, I think we only raised our cost up by 2%. But apart from that, yes, it's across marketing, it's across the things on the vessel that the customers really don't value. But more importantly, we're not just cutting to cut, we're really looking at what do customers care about, let's improve on those experiences while reducing items that the customer really doesn't care about. So there's no silver bullets here. It's just a lot of little things across the board. We are very excited with the progress we're making. That's been reiterated by the fact that we just reiterated our cost guidance. And I'm hopeful in the future that we can continue to improve on that. Harry Sommer : And Dan, I'll just add one more thing, specifically related to the food. I just want to emphasize we have in no way reduced the quality of food that we serve our guests. We still serve, especially on Oceania region, the best quality food that we can and in NCL very good quality food as well, where we have seen the efficiencies, if you will, are in things like buying direct as opposed to intermediaries and in logistics. We have made massive improvements in logistics, warehousing, shipping that obviously will show up in the food, but do not reflect the lower quality food. I can't emphasize that enough. We believe that our 3 brands in their respective places in the industry have the most -- have the best food quality and the most food options, and we are committed to that, but we think we can do that and still save money through the other items that I mentioned. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : I wanted to zoom in a little bit more on the second half. I think at one point, you guys had quantified the Red Sea impact. I think it was like 1 to 2 points for 2Q through 4Q. I think there was a view that third quarter might be the highest yield growth quarter of 2Q through 4Q because it had the least Red Sea impact. And I was just curious if you still expected that to be the case? Mark Kempa : Vince, yes, you are correct. We still expect third quarter to be the highest yield growth quarter. And I will remind everybody that in Q4 of '23, if I recall correctly, we had pricing of growth of 15% and yield growth of 9%. So we are rolling over a very healthy Q4 of 2023. So that's not to be implied that Q4 of this year is not doing well, but it is just certainly rolling over a much higher comp, but we do expect third quarter to be the highest. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And then a little bit bigger picture kind of strategy question. You and peers across the industry seem to be really investing in private islands and ramping efforts there, marketing leaning in. Just kind of curious what you're seeing out there that leads you to believe returns are there, that that's what the customer is looking for and how you kind of have -- went about making that decision? Harry Sommer : Yes. So when we look at our 2 private islands we have today, Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas and Harvest Caye in Belize, those are our 2 highest-rated destinations. Now we really had a pier at Harvest Caye. So there were no issues in that area. But in GSC, Great Stirrup Cay, excuse me, the lack of a pier caused us to miss much more frequently than we would have liked. So for us, it almost [indiscernible] on an ROI basis just by us being able to visit there. But of course, once we have the confidence that we can visit there almost 100% of the time, we certainly believe that it will be worth making the investments to continue to improve the guest experience as long as we focus, as Mark said before, on the things that gets value. I will say, listen, we've seen geopolitical uncertainty in various places of the world over time. So clearly, places like Belize and the Bahamas have an added benefit of being perhaps any more certain zones more close to home, which continues to give us confidence to invest. But we think what we're doing with GSC is fantastic. We think the pier, which will be available just in a year from now, so it's not like multiyears in the future, will be a great addition. We're committed to the area. Our guests love it. I think the experience on the island is already fantastic, more of a resort-type experience, and we'll continue to improve it. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Looking forward to Investor Day. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So if we kind of stay on yields and if we think about breaking down your revised yield guidance for the remainder of the year, I mean, look, it's pretty clear that the demand remains extremely strong. So I guess it seems to us that maybe your revised yield guidance is somewhat conservative. And I guess the question is around how you're thinking about pricing versus onboard for the rest of the year. It seems like you might be taking a pretty conservative view around onboard metrics, which makes sense, or possibly to close an opportunity just isn't as great as what we're used to witnessing given the strong book position. So just any help there would be appreciated? Harry Sommer : I'll maybe take the second part of the question on onboard business ticket, and I'll let Mark comment on the first part. With the way that we package and presell our onboard items, I think the distinction between onboard and ticket is much less important than it is in the past. So I would just encourage you and the other analysts, the other listeners, to focus on the total revenue number because really the split is a little bit arbitrary. That being said, obviously, we're happy with the future sales, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, and in our press release. We're happy with the onboard packages that are being sold in advance. And that's what gives us confidence for raising our yield guidance by a full point for the year. In terms of conservatism, maybe Mark can talk to that. Mark Kempa : Yes, Steve. So look, maybe as an example, look, we continue to see the consumer very, very healthy. We continue to see very strong trends across every revenue stream on the ship. So we remain very, very optimistic on that front. And maybe a way to frame it is, if you think about our prior guidance for the first quarter, we had -- we were already 2 months into the quarter when we had provided that guidance. And I think when you look at where we ended, we beat by almost 0.75 point. That's predominantly driven by onboard revenue. While I don't want to say we are ultra conservative, yes, we know we expect the consumer to spend. But I think given our extended booking curve, most of the upside in the quarter, if we see any, will be driven by onboard revenue. And I want to reiterate that we continue to see a very, very strong consumer in that respect. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. That's great. And then, Mark, if I'm looking at Slide 13, you guys are projecting just about a 34% EBITDA margin towards the end of this year. And I guess if we look a little bit further out, how should we think about the longer-term margin opportunity, especially as you think about where margins were prepandemic versus where they are now. Will the driver of kind of yield -- or excuse me, of margin improvement, just be more on the yield side of the equation? I guess what I'm trying to get at here is about the opportunity to take a significant amount of cost out of the equation, given what you guys have already done so far and maybe this is something you'll address more on May 20. Harry Sommer : Yes. So I think that's -- thank you for that last sentence because that was the answer I was going to provide you. Listen, we're super focused in this call talking about Q1 and guidance for Q2 in '24, which I think we've laid out. I think talking about more longer term, we'll have to wait the 19 more days until May 20 to talk about it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Harry Sommer : Brandt? Mark Kempa : We lost Brandt. Harry Sommer : Brandt? Okay. Maybe we should move on to the next. Mark Kempa : Yes. So we'll move on to next caller. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : In your prepared remarks, or even in the press release, I think you mentioned that you're at a record book position over the next 12 months. I know you want to talk only about '24, but just curious on how '25 is shaping up? I assume pricing is up. Just any details around that would be helpful. Harry Sommer : Thank you for that, Conor. So I'll just point out that the next 12 months would include Q1 of '25. So I think that gives you some guidance. And of course, that would be, at this point in the booking cycle the best booked quarter of 2025. So not really prepared to give guidance for the last 3 quarters, but I think that gives you some insights into how '25 is shaping up. Conor Cunningham : Okay. And then I appreciate the details on the dry-dock headwinds, and I realize that kind of lingers throughout '24, but does that roll off in '25? Or is it more of a '26? Just trying to understand, your exit rate on cost is obviously going to be really good in '24. So just curious on how we should think about dry-dock specifically next year and the year after? Mark Kempa : Yes, Conor. So look, I think we've said this before, '24 is really a normalization year in terms of dry-docks as we took the advantage during the shutdown to dry-dock most of our ships. But if you look at the size of our fleet and the composition of our fleet, as you go forward, whether it's '24, '25, '26, you're going to see about the same level of dry-docks just given the size of our fleet. So it might go up a couple of points -- or no, I shouldn't say a couple of points. It might go up or down a few days, but there's not going to be any material step up or step down going forward as we get back into a more normalized cycle for the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Sarah Inman : Brandt? Mark Kempa : Well, we'll try again on Brandt. Let's go to the next question. Sarah Inman : Let's go to the next question, Joe. Operator : And the next question will come from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Charles Scholes : Great. My first question concerns commissions paid out to the trade. It looks like your ticket revenues were up 21% year-over-year, though commissions, transportation and others were up 6%. Can you give a little more color on why the -- what's driving the divergence in there? Is it increases in book direct or change in mix of new to crews that typically will book direct? More color, please? And then I'll have a follow-up question. Harry Sommer : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. So, no, what we're seeing is not a reflection of changes in direct or significant changes in passenger mix. It's really more driven by the airline. You know that as a cruise line, we package air across all 3 of our brands. And as participation rate shifts from year-to-year -- and also, we're buying air a little bit better this year versus last year. The air component cost goes down. So it's a combination of slightly lower participation rate for air and us buying air a little bit more efficiently than we did last year. But our general direct versus trade, new to cruise has remained substantially the same year-over-year across the brands. Charles Scholes : Okay. Interesting. And then you've talked about your book position up significantly, whatnot year-over-year. Can you give a little bit more granularity on percentage-wise. How much ahead you are for the rest of the year versus the same time last year? And then also how much ahead, in fact, if you are ahead for next year versus, say, the same time last year for the comparable period? Mark Kempa : Yes, Patrick. Look, we won't give an exact percentage. What I can tell you is, if you refer to our prior remarks on our calls, generally speaking, we had said our sweet spot is somewhere in that 60% to 65% on a forward 12-month basis or at any given time, I should say. And so if you think of it from that reference, we could be up from there, but I won't give any specific percentages on that, other than the fact that we continue to see a very strong consumer, consumers who are willing to book further out and who are willing to pay higher prices. So I think all of that lends itself to a great environment to continue to capitalize on this demand. Charles Scholes : Are you -- can you say for your -- without giving a percentage, can you say your '25 book position is ahead versus comparable where you were a year ago for this year? Mark Kempa : Well, I think if you think about, as Harry said, our forward 12 months, which would include Q1, would imply that Q1 is ahead. But we won't comment on the rest of the year other than bookings are in line with our expectations where we believe they should be. So... Harry Sommer : The only additional the color that I'll give is related to Europe, which is a large part of our deployment this year in Q2 and Q3, where because we've had the benefit of a full booking cycle, we're seeing more Americans on our European deployment this year, which tends to elongate the booking curve a little bit and also tends to deliver slightly higher yields as opposed to selling those cabins a little closer into locals in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Chaiken with Mizuho. Benjamin Chaiken : Your comments on 2Q yields onboard forward booking trends are all very helpful. Just attacking this a little differently. Curious how you're thinking about 2Q yields on the net yield side. There are some headwinds and tailwinds. It'd be great if you could help us think about the different moving parts, specifically for 2Q, I guess I'm asking. So for example, those less Caribbean, but as you've suggested earlier, it sounds like the mix is not a factor. You've got Red Sea. Anything else just big picture? And maybe to put a finer point on it, however you cut it year-over-year versus '19 sequentially, it just seems like optically, there's a step down, and I guess I'm trying to open this up and understand the moving parts. Mark Kempa : Well, Ben, I think there is a step down from Q1, but that's purely as a result of the comparison in the same quarter of 2023. So as we said on our last call and this call, we are not, and I will repeat this, we are not seeing deceleration. I don't know how many more times I can say that across different calls and conferences. We are getting back to what we call a more normalized yield growth in terms of our business, which we have always said would be somewhere in the low to mid-single digits. And obviously, we continue to pursue much better than that. So yes, there is an impact in both Q2 and Q4 as a result of the Middle East and Red Sea. We've been very specific about that. But even absent that, we still continue to see very healthy pricing and yield growth. So I just want to make it clear. It's not a deceleration issue. It really is a comparison issue from quarter to quarter. Benjamin Chaiken : Sure. The premise of the question was actually not a deceleration. It was that you've said that in the past. So I'm trying to understand the moving parts that might kind of help us explain the nuances, but that's helpful. Mark Kempa : Yes. Ben, the moving parts in Q2 are really the Mid East and Red Sea for the most part, and that also impacts Q4 as well as Q4 having a significant rollover versus the same quarter in 2023. Benjamin Chaiken : Okay. And then as you think about Great Stirrup Cay, you announced the pier construction, which makes a lot of sense. Were you suggesting earlier in the call that you wait for the pier to be built and then wait a year or so to get kind of the demand picture under your belt before you start to invest in the island? Or is that not the correct interpretation? Harry Sommer : I wouldn't interpret it that way. I'm not prepared here to discuss our full long-term plans for Great Stirrup Cay. We'll talk a little bit more about that in 3 weeks. I'm just -- my comment was meant to say that the pier was the gating item that before we committed and have a schedule for the pier, it would not have been prudent for us to make substantial additional investments to the island, which for the record, is already a great experience. But now that we have the pier, it allows us to have a slightly more long-term view towards that.  But I don't want to give any indication of whether it's happening imminently or later. We'll talk little bit more about that in 3 weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs. Elizabeth Dove : To kind of belabor this net yield point, but I just want to understand the moving pieces in terms of the kind of quarterly cadence. Like as we think of your 2Q guidance of 4.3% growth and 3Q being higher. I would have thought that means quite a steep step down in 4Q, especially I would have thought you maybe get some occupancy recovery from the Hawaii comp last year. Anything you can say that can kind of help me think about that kind of quarterly cadence? Mark Kempa : Lizzie, I think as we said, we believe in the back half of the year, third quarter will be the highest yielding quarter. Fourth quarter, there was -- if you think about fourth quarter 2023, yes, there was a small impact on occupancy as a result of Hawaii. But I think as we look at the comp rolling over, again, if I recall correctly, somewhere in the zone of 14% pricing growth and maybe 9% to 10% yield last year, that's a very quality comp to roll over. So I think stay tuned. I think fourth quarter, there's still time and we're still building there. But we -- everything we see today, the environment remains healthy, and we expect strong results across all our quarters. Harry Sommer : Yes. I mean the only additional color I'll add, which Mark talked about in an earlier question and not this one is a slight headwind related to Red Sea cancellations in Q4, which would be a little bit more -- a little bit less, excuse me, than the headwind in Q2 because we had a little more time to have the replacement voyages on sale. And that's why it was so critical for us to get well ahead of this for 2025. So we've already canceled all of our voyages that have previously gone to [ Israel ] for 2025 and all the Red Sea crossings in the first half of '25 so that we wouldn't have the same headwind challenges to our 2025 growth. Elizabeth Dove : Perfect. That's really helpful. And it feels like the very premium luxury market is more on focus, especially with the capital markets activity. Anything you can share there in terms of pricing on your more premium brands versus the Norwegian brands? And also any step you might take to protect share? Or is this competitor has some pretty aggressive supply growth targets? Harry Sommer : So I'm trying to distill that question down into some thoughts in my mind. So obviously, we're excited to see new entrants into the market. We think anything that has -- that draws more focus, if you will, to this market and the public market and the excellent opportunity that cruising represents is positive for all of us. So I sent through our e-mail congratulating him this morning on the successful IPO, and we obviously wish him the best of luck. We see the growth at Viking House, and we have nice growth on the Oceania region brand that's measured that we can absorb and that we're happy for. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research. Frederick Wightman : I just wanted to come back to the Red Sea impact for next year. Are you expecting to fully offset the yield impact from this year? Was that a comment -- is that a comment on costs? I just want to understand if it's yield dilutive from a -- if you do have to do repositionings and it's less desirable itineraries? Mark Kempa : Fred, so we have announced all cancellations of our Red Sea and Mid East itineraries for 2025, with the exception, I believe we may have one sailing still on sale in the back half of '25 for the Oceania brand. Apart from that, we have canceled all those sailings. And the thinking there is, obviously, the earlier you reroute those and create better itineraries, the better sales cycle you have. So the -- certainly, the improved yield and economics that you can garner from that should improve. That said, if I had a choice of doing other areas in the world versus those select Mid-East and Red Sea, those are always a premium. But certainly, Certainly, it won't be a significant tailwind, but at the same point, it won't be a significant drag. Frederick Wightman : Okay. That's fair. And then just trying to understand where there could potentially be some upside for yields throughout the year. It sounded like in response to an earlier question that you were saying the potential upside would come largely from onboard. I think that was in response to 2Q specifically. But just thinking about the back half of the year, especially in 4Q when that Caribbean exposure increases again? I mean you guys still feel like you have the ability to take price and grow yields from a ticket perspective later in the year, right? Harry Sommer : Yes. So Fred, that's the job of our brands. We look at the booking curve, the consumer demand, and we do everything we can to raise price at any time that we can. I think as Mark mentioned, Q2 and most of Q3 is pretty big, given where we are in the booking curve. Is there potential in Q4? Absolutely, and we'll do everything that we can to optimize that potential. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : I have 2 questions. One is, in your release, you showed that a percent change in net yield would add about $67 million to EBITDA. You raised by 1 point and raising EBITDA by $50 million. Maybe half of that looks like it's from higher fuel -- of the sort of kind of the -- like looking for that other $17 million that was not in your EBITDA raise. Maybe half of that was due to higher fuel. Is the other half just sort of conservatism and leaving a little powder dry, which is fine? Or is there another factor there that's not getting it down to the EBITDA line? And then -- my second question, just to put up there as well, is any color you can give us on your new ship orders in terms of the cost per berth kind of relative to previous ship orders? I fully understand that there would be inflation at the yards and all that, but just trying to quantify that in some way. Mark Kempa : Yes. Thanks for your exacting calculations, Robin. Obviously, there's some slight rounding in there when you look at the yield and the sensitivity. So essentially, yes, we did carry over about 100 basis point increase. And I think if you look at my prepared remarks, most of that was -- some of that was partially offset by higher fuel and then higher interest expense for 2 reasons. Number one, the portion of our debt portfolio that is not fixed, which is about 5%, 6%, but then also commitment fees related to some of our newbuild announcements that went effective as well. All in all, I think when you look at the back half of the year, as I said, we're raising yield guidance, and that's about $0.10 -- $0.10, $0.11, offset by $0.04 or $0.05 of interest in fuel. And I didn't catch the back end of your question, I apologize. Harry Sommer : She asked about any color on inflation. Robin Farley : Yes, just the cost per berth or kind of getting a sense of the change in building costs at the yards, understanding that there will be inflation there, but just trying to get a ballpark for it. And the prior questions have been about the EBITDA. I fully understand the interest expense impact on the EPS. I was looking for the extra $10 million in EBITDA. But anything on the cost per birth? Harry Sommer : Just to be really clear on the EBITDA side, we calculated the 1% raise that we had at just over $60 million. So it wasn't exactly a full point. It was more like 97 basis points or something like that. So the $60 million minus the fuels should get you to almost exactly the $50 million EBITDA range. So we apologize for that confusion between the $60 million and $67 million. Listen, in terms of inflation on newbuilds, I think what you'll see is sort of 2 factors offsetting each other. I think the inflation on newbuild is similar to the inflation you see in the general population, at least when we do our calculations. I think what we can do to help offset that inflation is the same as what you're seeing in our general cost structure where the same transformation office process that looks to doing things more efficiently and effectively will allow us to offset part of the impact of inflation, certainly not all of it. So that would be our guide, if you will, going forward. And then I think we have time for one last question, operator. Operator : And our last question will come from the line of James Hardiman with Citi. James Hardiman : So just quickly I wanted to circle back to the cost conversation. Obviously, a lot of noise around dry-dock, pretty flattish, though ex the dry-dock step-up for the first half. Is that the assumption for the second half that ex the dry-dock movement that costs are going to be pretty flattish year-over-year. And if so, how long can that last, particularly as dry docks flatten out in 2025? Harry Sommer : So the quick answer is yes. We believe that the cost will be essentially flat, excluding dry-dock, as you mentioned for the back half of the year. We're very proud of the efforts that the team are making, not really prepared to comment on '25 and beyond at this point. Mark Kempa : James, all I would add to that is, again, we have talked about we have a laser focus on rightsizing and leveraging our scale. We continue to do that. This is a permanent activity for us, not a onetime exercise. So while obviously, it gets harder further down the stream you go, we are just relooking at every facet of our business, and we continue to believe that there's opportunity out there all without impacting the guest experience and actually delivering a better product than what we've had today. Harry Sommer : Well, what a wonderful set of comments in the call. I share Mark's passion for continuing to improve our operating margins while delivering a fantastic guest experience. I want to thank all of you for your time today, and I really am looking forward to talking about our long-term targets and strategy when we meet on May 20. Thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Donna, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inman. Ms. Inman please proceed. Sarah Inman : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. Throughout the call we will refer to a slide presentation that can be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2024 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry. Harry? Harry Sommer : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. This is an exciting time for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The second quarter had surpassed our expectations with results exceeding guidance on all key metrics allowing us to increase our full year guidance for the third time this year. At our Investor Day, we emphasized our unwavering commitment to balancing return on experience what we call ROX and return on investment or ROI. This strategy is clearly yielding results. We are witnessing robust demand with strong pricing and booking volumes, leading to record-breaking advance ticket sales. This demand, coupled with our onboard offering and high-quality service, has led to strong guest satisfaction scores while we continue to effectively control costs. These indicators affirm that our strategic approach is positioning us for sustained long-term success on our well-defined path forward for continued growth to achieve our charting the course strategy, which includes ambitious 2026 financial and sustainability targets. Today, I am excited to discuss some of our key milestones for the second quarter and the factors that drove our enhanced guidance for the remainder of 2024. We're thrilled to see how the pillars and initiatives under our charting the course strategy are moving the needle for our business. As these are strongly underpinned by our global sustainability program, Sail and Sustain, we're also excited to share the progress outlined in our recent sustainability report. Later in the call, I will hand it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for 2024. We kicked off the second quarter with impressive momentum, continuing the positive trends from the beginning of 2024 and proudly executing on our exceptional performance pillar. As you can see on slide four, our second quarter results beat guidance across the board. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% and adjusted EPS was up 33%. Notably, we hit our year-end target of decreasing net leverage by one and a half turns a full six months early. As we move forward, we remain committed to further deleveraging with a clear focus and attaining a 2026 target of mid-four times. These strong results also allowed us to raise our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. We now expect to end the year with adjusted operational EBITDA margin of 34.5%, a full 400 basis point improvement over 2023, which puts us well on the way to our 2026 target of approaching historical margin levels of 39%. We also increased our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to $1.53, an approximate 120% increase over 2023, and an impressive step forward towards our 2026 target of $2.45. And lastly, we are on track to achieve double-digit adjusted ROIC by year-end. This acceleration in our financial results speaks volumes about our team's dedication and hard work. Turning to slide five, I want to emphasize how our long-term growth platform pillar is set to deliver measured capacity growth and optimize our fleet to drive strong financial returns. Historically, capacity growth has driven outsized revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, and we expect this trend to continue with the incorporation of larger and more efficient, state-of-the-art vessels to our fleet, which I'll now give some updates on. Turning to slide six, we are currently focused on our next two new ships being delivered in 2025, both currently scheduled for an on-time delivery. Our first milestone in the quarter was the float-out of Norwegian Aqua, which we celebrated with our partner Fincantieri. Norwegian Aqua, the first ship in the next-generation Prima Plus class, is an evolution of the previous Prima class ship and will be 10% larger. This space allows for more innovative offerings, including the world's first-ever hybrid roller coaster and water slide, the Aqua Slide Coaster. We are also building a digital sports complex with an interactive LED floor and our most expansive 360-degree outdoor promenade, the Ocean Boulevard. We cannot wait for Aqua to make her debut in April 2025. Most recently, we also celebrated the float-out of Oceania's Allura at the Fincantieri Shipyard in Genoa. This marked the transition of the vessel from dry dock to fitting out berth, initiating the final stages of construction. Allura will redefine luxury with its designer-inspired interiors, including opulent suites, sophisticated lounges, and exceptional new dining venues. Scheduled to enter service in the Mediterranean in July 2025, she will follow her normal summer season with winter voyages in the Caribbean. Oceania was also busy this quarter with the return to service of Marina after an extensive refurbishment. This all-encompassing rejuvenation includes the addition of three new dining options and reimagined penthouse suites. And just as we add more capacity and new features on existing ships, we are also excited for enhancements to our destination and home ports. We're increasing our sailing to exciting destinations, such as Bermuda and Great Stirrup Cay, where we plan to complete construction of our two-ship pier towards the end of next year. We'll also be adding a new home port to our roster in 2025, JAXPORT, in Jacksonville, Florida. And in April 2026, NCL will make its return to Philadelphia after a 17-year hiatus. With the addition of Philadelphia, NCL will now service seven of the top ten largest metropolitan regions in the United States. We are excited about our deployment, and our guests are as well, as shown by our booking trends, which you can see on slide seven. The company continues to experience strong consumer demand. In the second quarter, we continue to see strong bookings, with our 12-month forward book position at the upper end of our optimal range on strong pricing. During the second quarter, we observed continued strength in onboard revenue as well, which was driven by our guests' continued enjoyment of our shore excursion and onboard amenities, including specialty restaurants and communication services, which had been bolstered by the continued implementation of Starlink across the fleet. Additionally, pre-booked onboard revenue for capacity day showed solid growth, increasing by 15% as more guests opted for pre-cruise purchases. And as we've seen from prior experience, higher pre-cruise spend typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest's cruise journey. As a result, our net yield grew 6.3% during the second quarter, surpassing our guidance by a full 200 basis points. During the second quarter, about 3% of our capacity was originally scheduled to be in the Middle East region, with high team percentages on our Oceania and region brands scheduled to be in that region. The cancellation of these itineraries resulted in a very short resale cycle. Despite this setback, results for this quarter were strong enough to offset this, underscoring the robust demand environment for cruises and the agility and effectiveness of our team to overcome difficult challenges. Without a doubt, our financial performance exceeded our expectations, and we're therefore raising our yearly net yield growth guidance, increasing 100 basis points from 7.2% to 8.2%. It is worth noting that our occupancy guidance remains essentially unchanged as we're already guiding to full shifts, so the entire increase in our guidance is on the back of stronger pricing. As such, we are anticipating strong pricing growth across all four quarters in 2024. Turning to slide eight, to continue cementing our leading position beyond 2024, I am excited to announce that our second quarter advance ticket sales surpassed the first quarter, increasing 11% year-over-year and reaching a new all-time high of $3.9 billion. This success was driven by robust pricing, a dynamic deployment mix, coupled with increased pre-sale packages and capacity growth. Now moving on to what is at the core of our charting, the core strategy, our sustainability program, Sale & Sustain. In June, we were pleased to result our annual sustainability report. On slide nine, we summarized some of our main 2023 highlights, which underscore our commitment to integrating sustainability into our overall business approach. Some noticeable accomplishments include achieving our 2024 target to equip 50% of our fleet with shore power technology a full year early. We reign on track to equip 70% of our fleet with this technology by 2025. In fact, we recently celebrated the launch of shore power at Port Miami, making it the first major cruise port on the U.S. East Coast to offer shore power at five of its terminals, including our own Terminal B, the Pearl of Miami. We also reached our goal of testing 20% of our fleet with biodiesel blend by expanding tests to four more ships throughout 2023. Our new target is 40% of our fleet to test biodiesel by 2024. Finally, doubling down on our people excellence pillar, we continue diversifying our sourcing, having spent over $635 million with small businesses and businesses with minority, women, veteran, or economically disadvantaged qualifications in 2023. And most recently, Forbes named us as the best American employer for women, a milestone we are particularly pleased with. Our journey does not stop here. We remain dedicated to advancing towards our sale and sustained targets going forward, maintaining high standards of operational excellence, and creating lasting value for our business and various stakeholders through sustainable practices. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team for all of these impressive accomplishments. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our very strong second quarter 2024 financial results, our improved full year 2024 guidance, and our increasingly solid financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2024 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost ex-fuel PCD are on a constant currency basis, and comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Let's begin with our second quarter results, which are highlighted on slide 10. In short, we exceeded guidance across the board, outpacing our targets for the quarter, starting with the top line results were impressive, with net yield increasing 6.3%, exceeding our guidance of 4.3% by 200 basis points. Several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong top line growth in the quarter, which included robust demand for European, Caribbean, and Alaskan sailings, where the majority of our capacity is deployed this quarter. Stronger than anticipated onboard revenue and close in sailing demand. And finally, the redeployment of canceled Red Sea sailings were better than our initial expectations. Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD came in below guidance at 163, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that will now fall into the third quarter. As expected, our unit cost this quarter included approximately $9 from higher dry dock days and related costs as compared to 2023. Excluding the impact of the dry docks, our adjusted next cruise cost ex fuel PCD would have been flat year-over-year, once again demonstrating our ability to fully offset the impacts of inflation with our disciplined cost savings initiatives across the entire organization. These initiatives, combined with robust top line growth, have yielded strong results. Adjusted EBITDA came in at approximately $588 million, surpassing our guidance of $555 million, resulting in a year-over-year increase of 14%. Adjusted EPS was $0.40, exceeding our guidance of $0.32, and increased 33% compared to the same quarter last year. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance. Strong top line growth, combined with our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, enabled us to surpass our guidance metrics for the quarter. This strong momentum positions us well as we look ahead, and as a result, we are raising our earnings guidance as highlighted on slide 11. We are thrilled to announce that for the third time this year, we have raised our full year guidance, reflecting the strong performance and strength of our business. Since our initial guidance in February, net yield growth is expected to increase 280 basis points to 8.2%, and we have maintained our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCV guidance, which, excluding the impact of dry docks, is expected to be flat for the year. I will go into more detail on this a bit later in my remarks. As a result of the strong top line and sub-inflationary unit cost growth, we have increased our guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $150 million, from $2.2 billion to $2.35 billion. All of this is flowing to the bottom line, resulting in an increase in our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately 25%, underscoring our impressive operational execution and strong market demand. These results mark significant progress towards achieving our charting the course 2026 targets, as we outlined in May. Moving on to a more detailed look at our guidance on slide 12, we outline our expectations for the third quarter and full year, as well as the implied metrics for the fourth quarter. Starting with net yield, we anticipate net yield growth of almost 6.5% in the third quarter. This growth is driven by several factors. Over 70% of our sailings in the third quarter are in Europe and Alaska, regions where we are experiencing strong demand from North American customers. Continued strong onboard revenue trends, combined with healthy pre-booking for onboard amenities. Unlike Q2 and Q4, this quarter is unaffected by disruptions from the Middle East cancellations and rerouting. These favorable trends and our ongoing momentum have allowed us to increase our full year net guidance to 8.2%. I want to emphasize that our latest guidance implies a healthy net yield growth of 5% for the fourth quarter. This builds off of an impressive 8% growth in 2023 that was underpinned by 14% pricing. Our Q4 2024 growth also comes in the face of headwinds from rerouted Middle East sailings, which comprised 10% of our deployment in the fourth quarter and was disproportionately weighted to our luxury brands. Now, turning to our attention to adjusted net cruise costs, where our guidance remains unchanged, a true testament to the diligent efforts of the entire organization. For the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted net cruise cost ex-fuel PCD to increase by 3.3% to 156 from 151 in the same period last year. I would like to highlight a few points about the quarterly numbers, as there are many moving parts, and I will get into those yearly changes later in my remarks. First, in Q3 of last year, we recognized approximately $2 of non-recurring benefits. Second, keep in mind the timing of expenses. As I mentioned previously, our Q2 unit costs were better than expected, primarily due to timing differences of certain expenses between Q2 and Q3. Consequently, on a year-over-year basis, Q3 unit costs are up. However, this is merely a timing issue, and for the full year excluding the impact of dry docks, we still expect our unit costs to remain essentially flat and in line with our prior guidance. And third, I will mention variable compensation. We are recognizing higher variable compensation due to our business outperforming initial forecasts, and this has a disproportionate weighting in the third quarter consistent with the seasonality of our earnings. As a result of strong net yield growth and cost savings initiatives, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $870 million, which is driving adjusted EPS of $0.92, a 21% increase over the same period in 2023. Moving to slide 13, I'd like to revisit our net yield guidance since our Q1 results in May and highlight the confidence and strength we are seeing for the latter half of 2024. At our investor day, we increased our full year guidance, indicating that the majority of the uplift was expected in the second half of the year. Giving more detail on this now, we had expected that about $35 million of the $50 million adjusted gross margin improvement or an increase of 120 basis points of net yield to materialize in the second half. Today, we are raising our full year guidance once again, with an additional $35 million improvement in adjusted gross margin or 120 basis points in the second half. This positions us to achieve solid net yield growth of 5.9% in the back half of 2024. Moving to slide 14, I want to dive a bit deeper into our margin enhancement initiatives. As we stated at our investor day, a key pillar of our algorithm is boosting margins and reducing costs across the entire organization. And we continue to see the fruits of these efforts during 2024. During the first and second quarters, we have been able to keep our unit costs flat, excluding dry dock. And as I mentioned earlier, due to the timing, this metric will increase in the third quarter, but should decline in the fourth quarter. And as a result, our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD will be essentially flat year-over-year, fully offsetting inflation, as well as the increased variable compensation due to the company's strong performance. This speed is not easy and is the result of the tireless work of our entire organization and transformation team. I am confident that we will be able to continue this momentum in the years that come. Turning to slide 15, we can clearly see the impact of our disciplined approach to earnings and returns as outlined during our recent investor day. The key elements of our algorithm are straightforward. Improved net yields and rigorous cost management drive margin expansion. That margin expansion in conjunction with controlled capacity growth results in substantial adjusted EPS growth. Moreover, this adjusted EPS growth, when paired with our disciplined capital allocation strategy, allows us to prioritize debt repayment in the short to midterm. This approach not only reduces our net leverage, but also strengthens our balance sheet and enhances our adjusted ROIC, which, by the way, is on target to hit double digits this year, another important milestone toward our 2026 target of 12%. During the second quarter, we improved our trailing 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin to 33%. As we close out the year, we anticipate ending with a margin of 34.5%, marking a substantial improvement of 400 basis points from 2023. This progress is a significant milestone as we strive toward our target of approaching historical margins of approximately 39%. Now let's shift to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on slide 16, which has not changed significantly since Q1. During the quarter, and as expected, our 6% 2024 exchangeable notes converted to shares. And our next maturity is our 565 million notes due 2024, which we are expecting to refinance and or partially repay by its maturity in December. Turning over to leverage on slide 17, we are proud that we achieved our net leverage goal six months ahead of schedule, reducing our leverage by approximately one and a half turns and ending the quarter at 5.9 times. Achieving leverage in the five is no small feat since we ended 2023 at 7.3 times. As you know, we are on a multi-year deleveraging journey to de-risk the balance sheet, targeting the mid-fours, and this quarter's results are another significant milestone in that journey. In closing, I want to emphasize that this has been an exceptional quarter where we surpassed guidance across all key metrics. This momentum has enabled us to raise our full-year guidance for the third time. This is all a testament to the strategy we outlined at our investor day and that I discussed earlier. We are excited about the second half of the year and remain confident in our strategy going forward. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks. Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Mark. I want to close by reminding everyone of the ambitious targets and strategies that we laid out in investor day just two months ago, which are listed on slide 17. Our bold vision is to provide guests with exceptional vacation experiences, allowing them to vacation better and experience more. This vision is the foundation of our charting the course strategy supported by our four pillars, people excellence, guest-centric product offering, long-term growth platform, and exceptional performance. These pillars are all underpinned by our commitment to sustainability through our sale and sustain program. This new strategy and vision lead to a simple yet powerful earnings and return algorithm that Mark discussed earlier that will help us deliver on our 2026 financial targets. Our entire management team is driven and focused on this new strategy, and I'm positive that this quarter's results gives you even greater confidence that we are on track to achieve our long-term goals. We are optimistic about our future and look forward to sharing this journey of growth and success with you. With that, I'll hand the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session. Operator : Thank you, Harry. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Steven Wieczynski of Stifel. Please go ahead. Steven Wieczynski : Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the results here. So Harry or Mark, in terms of booking trends, it seems like you're obviously well-booked out for this year. As you noted, most of your bookings today are for 2025 or beyond. Just wondering, as we look out to 2025, if you're seeing pretty much strength across all itineraries at this point, or are there certain itineraries that are getting more attention right now? Then you also noted that you're at the high end of what you call your optimal book position. Has that optimal book position changed at all, given how much further out your customers are booking these days? Mark Kempa : I'll take that one, Steve. Harry, first off, thanks for the kind words. We were very happy with our results this quarter and our increased guidance for the year as well. Two different questions. I'll do my best to address both. On the booking trends, not really seeing any key patterns there. We're happy with the strength across the board. We're seeing good strength in the Caribbean, Europe, Alaska, exotics, all the places that we go to. We were pretty meticulous going into 2025 with our itinerary planning to do a good job at balancing our demand and supply by region of the world. We seem to generally be successful. I'll point out one thing that I'm particularly pleased with. It's Alaska and Europe for next summer. Please don't take that as a comment that I'm not pleased with anything else. We're pleased with everything. That's one area that seems to be doing particularly well and a little bit ahead of our expectations, so we're happy with that. In terms of your second comment about whether or not our view of book position has changed, I think so. I think if you were to compare this, for example, to 2019, which last normal year way back when, I would say that our optimal book position is probably a little bit ahead, but I think that's just due to better analytics, better revenue management tools, better thoughts of the future. I just want to reiterate, perhaps save a question from someone else in the future. Our goal is not to be at record book positions. Our goal is to be at optimum book positions such that we can maximize yield. We don't take record book positions to the bank. We take yield to the bank. And we have calibrated our tools such that, sometimes it's okay to slow down bookings in order to raise prices. And one thing that we're particularly proud of that I mentioned in my prepared remarks is we have really seen robust pricing for 2025 up significantly compared to this time last year for 2024. And that's something that obviously we're going to continue to do our best on to deliver towards our 2025 and 2026 long-term financial goals, which we mentioned on yesterday. Steven Wieczynski : And Harry, maybe if I can ask one more real quick one here, but you made a remark in your prepared remarks about, you know, how you're charting the course targets are, you used the word ambitious, which, I think is a pretty interesting adjective there. So maybe I'm reading too much into that remark, but, as we sit here today, I mean, if you guys are targeting double-digit, ROICs by the end of this year and your target out to 2026 is 12%, I mean, that doesn't seem overly ambitious to us. So maybe that's not even a question, but, I'll stop there and see how you would respond to that. Harry Sommer : I'm not sure I read a question in there either. So I'll try to do my best to respond. Listen, when I say they're ambitious, I mean that we believe that it's the proper cadence that drives the company forward to have great results. So I wouldn't read that my comments that ambitious, that I think they're, crazy optimistic, nor are they in such a way that we can't achieve them. We're very much committed and we are reiterating our support today that we're committed to hitting these targets in 2026. And I think the commentary that we gave on book position, the visibility we have into 2025, allows us to reiterate the goals that we think we're well on track to achieving now. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Harry. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ben Chaiken of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Benjamin Chaiken : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know you called out timing as a factor between 2Q and 3Q for costs, but it sounds like some incremental progress on the cost side as well that helped offset costs both in the quarter and the year. I'm not sure if there's anything you can elaborate on. Were these essentially incremental cost saves as part of the longer term goal that you found early or maybe incremental opportunities? And I guess what I'm referring to is the incremental compensation expense, yet essentially unchanged full year cost guide. And then any quantification would be super helpful. Thanks. And then I have one more. Mark Kempa : Yes, good morning, Ben. This is Mark. So you're absolutely right. We continue to be very, very confident in achieving our cost reduction and waste elimination goals. So when you think about the full year, I think in the quarter our costs were favorable. I think it was, what, $6 million, $7 million. That's just the timing between quarters. But when you step back and you think about that on a full year basis, you are absolutely right. Due to better performance that we called out, we do have variable comp that is hitting us both in second quarter and second half of the year and disproportionately weighted to the third quarter. So all-in-all, that indicates that we're actually pacing ahead in terms of our overall $100 million goal that we had committed for this year. So we continue to find new things. We continue to hone in and eliminate waste. We're committed to that and very happy on the progress we're seeing going forward. Benjamin Chaiken : Got you. That's helpful. And then switching gears, thinking longer term, I know the peer will be complete in October 25. Do you plan on making incremental investments in parallel with that opening, or do you think at least subsequent to? Mark Kempa : I think there'll be a little bit of both. I think there'll be some parallel investments, but I think this is a long-term development plan for us. As you know, we have one of the largest private islands in the Caribbean. We have lots of real estate to build on. We have a long-term master plan. So I think you can look to see some things opening up in 2025 with the peer, and more things will come in 2026 and 2027. We are committed. We have a significant percentage, especially of our NCL fleet, visiting there in the winters and even now some in the summers as well. Perhaps you caught some of our deployment changes when we announced our 26th deployment for NCL a couple of weeks ago. And we plan to maximize our real estate and what we believe is a competitive advantage in the Caribbean with this island. Harry Sommer : And Ben, I just want to highlight that that will be over time. We are not anticipating or should you expect there's going to be some level of ramped up CapEx over the next year or two. We will make measured disciplined investments there while looking to repurpose dollars that were otherwise going to be spent within the organization. So again, it will be in a measured way and associated with returns that we would expect with such investment. Benjamin Chaiken : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham : Hi. Thank you. Mark, just sticking with costs. So yes, the core cost performance seems to be tracking ahead. I just as you start to think about 2025, I realize you have some lingering dry dock headwinds and just any early reads on the puts and takes there. Like, for example, like the development of like Jacksonville or the private island start to add incremental costs to next year in general. Just any thoughts there right now. Thank you. Mark Kempa : Yes. Good morning, Conor. Look, I think when you think about 2025, we're not expecting any sort of material headwinds from our core fundamental costs, other than what we would expect against normal inflation, which again, we've been very adamant. We believe we can deliver sub-inflationary costs. But things around the island or even I think you mentioned dry docks, when we think about dry docks year-over-year, there is no substantial step up. I think our dry dock days, you know, might change year-over-year. It's in the single digit number. Now, there may be different capacity days in terms of timing of the dry docks or similar of next year. But overall, that's not a headwind when you think about it from a 20,000-foot level. So we're focused on, as we've been saying, we're focused on our algorithm. We believe we can deliver sub-inflationary unit cost growth or better. And Q2 and our second half guidance is another testament to that, that we're on a strong path toward that course. Harry Sommer : And the only additional color I'll add, as you asked specifically about Jacksonville, is we have no material investment. That's an investment led by the local community, which obviously we're going to partner with by breeding [ph] ships there long-term. But that's on their dime, so to speak, not ours. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Helpful. And then on the comment... Mark Kempa : I'm sorry, Connor. For color, same situation with Philadelphia, which we also announced. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Helpful. Then on the comment of booking for 2025 and just where the curve sits, in the past, you've talked about the negative impact to having like longer, more immersive, cruises that won't let you -- basically will inhibit you from getting back to 2019 occupancy levels. But just given the stated demand, like why wouldn't occupancy be a further tailwind into 2025, outside of you guys just pushing rate in general for yield? Thank you. Mark Kempa : I'll just say, Conor, and I hope I get to the essence of your question. Listen, our core driver revenue is the first and second guests in the cabin, not necessarily the third guests in the cabin. The third guest doesn't tend to pay very much. So, our focus is really more on cabin occupancy than passenger occupancy, because those third and fourth guests have a very small marginal benefit. So, once again, this really gets to optimizing yield, not necessarily optimizing an occupancy number or something along those lines. Conor Cunningham : That's actually helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. And congrats on a nice quarter. So, two-part question. Harry, on the robust demand that you cited into the back half of the year, could you elaborate on pricing power globally or just any pushback at all that you're seeing in any region? And then, Mark, with the fourth quarter net yield raised today, and if we think about demand momentum, if demand momentum continued, I guess, how linear is the 2.5 point cost spread target multi-year? Thinking if net yields were to continue to outperform your plan, how best to think about that 2.5 point cost spread? Harry Sommer : Okay, those are two good questions. I'm actually going to crack at both of them, and then Mark will do some cleanup after my second answer, because the first one is relatively straightforward. The overwhelming majority of our demand, especially on the NCL brand, but even across Oceania and region, comes from the North American consumer. So it really wouldn't be -- while I'm happy to share what's happening in the rest of the world, which is really good as well, it wouldn't materially impact our numbers anyway. So, I think that's a more important answer to the question. The European and Asian consumer is very \u2013 is only on the margin important to us. But to be clear, they're doing well as well. We are happy with the demand out of Europe. We're happy with the demand out of Latin America, Australia, all the places that we sell core consumers to the U.S., and they continue to do well for us. In terms of next year, listen, 2.5% is a baseline. Obviously, we are going to do everything in our power to overachieve on yield, and we're going to do everything in our power to overachieve on cost, I mean coming in with better cost, but I think 2.5% is a very good place to start. We only announced that about 2 months ago. We're still focused on that for 2025 and 2026. Mark Kempa : Yes. Matthew, just to highlight some things. So look, when we announced our targets, what I think it would be important to understand is, number one, there is no hockey stick implication or assumption that we're going to do X in 2025, and we have to do Y in 2026. That was a very broad-based spread that we've committed to. So what do I mean by that? Yes, there may be some variability between quarters either upward or downward of that. I mean it's very, very early when we look at 2025 and 2026. So I wouldn't get caught up on the quarterly spread. I would concentrate on the full year spread, which is what we're aiming for. And again, we're not assuming any sort of hockey stick scenario, and I think that's the important thing to keep in mind in your models and your thinking. Matthew Boss : It's great color. Best of luck. Mark Kempa : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Brant Montour of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandt Montour : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, just on the fourth quarter implied guide, I think the fourth quarter guidance on our math for per diems is something in the low two percentage range. And I think there's Middle East there. Can you -- or can you just start up quantifying what the Middle East impact is on the fourth quarter in particular? Mark Kempa : Yes, look, good morning. And as we've talked about before in the Middle East, you know, I think a call or two earlier in the year, we had said the Middle East Red Sea was about a one to two point impact for the year. And if you think about that on the quarters, it's disproportionately weighted to Q4 of this year because about 10% of our capacity was in that region. So I can't give you full -- I'm not going to give you full or complete quantification for Q4 other than I would urge you to consider that it was 10% of our deployment that was disproportionately weighted on our luxury brand. So it is certainly weighing down on the fourth quarter. That said, as I've also said in my remarks, fourth quarter of last year we had 14% pricing growth and 8% yield. And even more importantly, I think when you look at the fourth quarter and the second half and you think about the progression that we've made over the last four to five months, we have continually increased our guidance for both the third and fourth quarters consistently. And I think that is a testament that we are seeing strength and we are seeing strong momentum. So I'll leave you with that, but I think we're very satisfied with where we are and hopefully we can outperform that. Harry Sommer : And the only additional color, Brandt, that I'll add is we now, as I said earlier in the Q&A session, we managed to yield not to price and we're guiding now to a 5-point yield increase year-over-year, which, quite frankly, considering that we're guiding at 6% now for Q2 and Q3, and -- we don't view that as a material difference. We don't go 6% 1 quarter, 5% another quarter as anything other than the normal ebbs and flows of businesses. So I think this conversation about some sort of deceleration can finally be put to bed. We tried last time, but we're obviously weren't successful. Hopefully, after this time, we can finally put that to bed. Brandt Montour : Thanks for that, Harry and Mark. So on a follow up question, Marriott this morning talked about seeing a slightly lower ancillary spend across the system. The U.S. was implicated in that again, broad based, but slight. You guys have your own real time cash register. Are you seeing any wobbles or wavers in that onboard spend over the last year? Sorry for the short term question, but it's topical. Mark Kempa : Sure. I'll give you a short answer and then a longer answer. So the short answer is no. We are seeing no absolutely 0 decrease in onboard spend. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, in fact, have the preselling of onboard is actually up considerably over the prior period that we comped to. The slightly longer answer is you need to keep in mind a couple of factors. The huge value gap between hotel ADRs and cruise line yields. I think at our Investor Day, we referenced a 40% value gap, which really still means we have tremendous runway to go to catch up the hotels. We consider that a long-term tailwind for the company. And also the fact that because our bookings pattern is so much further in advance, we have lots of opportunities to engage with our consumer and discuss with them all the value of being on our ship. I gave a little bit of the fact that the people are in our product, the whole time, unlike a hotel where people come and go, sort of are on the ship for extended periods of their vacation, which gives us a little bit of a tailwind there as well. So overall, the short answer is no cracks, no deterioration. If anything, it continues to be strong and more long-term, I think there are fundamental things that work in our favor that make our business quite a bit more resilient than the hotel on the ancillary/onboard spend category. Brandt Montour : Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Mark Kempa : Next question. Donna? Operator : My apologies. My mic was muted. The next question is coming from Vin Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead. Vincent Ciepiel : Great. So really encouraging to hear about the positive revision of the fourth quarter. And I think you used the word robust to describe what you're seeing for pricing for 2025. So it sounds like things are setting up pretty well for that low to mid-single-digit yield growth range that you target. Could you comment on how you think new hardware and maybe any itinerary or geographic type changes could impact yield for next year? Is it something that you think will be accretive, neutral, dilutive to yield? How should we be thinking about that? Harry Sommer : I -- so thanks, Vince. I think the reiteration of the low to mid-single-digit yield growth for next year is spot on and that continues to be our goal for 2025 and 2026. When we look at our deployment mix for 2025 versus 2024, obviously, there's some changes on the margin, but it's not a substantial change year-over-year. Obviously, we didn't have any new hardware come online this year, which would be a tailwind for next year. We have two ships coming on next year, one a little earlier, one towards the back half of the year. So I don't think that new ships will have a material impact as well. I think most of what you see next year is just going to be organic based on marketing, demand, tweaking revenue management tools and just being more effective at executing in the company. So I don't think there's any huge onetime or our ancillary items that impact yield for next year. Vincent Ciepiel : Thanks. And an unrelated follow-up on loyalty, I know this is something that we've talked about briefly in the past. Just curious where you guys are at in that process, and if you've given more thought or are already taking steps to help, reward folks for staying within the brand family across the portfolio of brands? Mark Kempa : Good question, but it's not really something we're prepared to talk about yet. Obviously, what we see in the industry is on our radar screen, and we're studying it, but not really in a place to comment at the current time. Vincent Ciepiel : Okay, thank you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from James Hardiman of Citi. Please go ahead. James Hardiman : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, you guys have done a great job the last couple quarters and really implied in the guidance for the year on the cost front, basically keeping that cruise cost flat next to dry dock. Maybe help us think through how long you can continue to do that, i.e., if we think about this year, was there a disproportionate benefit from some of the cost saves that would inevitably slow next year? And I guess, conversely, how to think about inflation next year, or could that sort of flattish ex-dry dock trend continue for longer? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Good morning, James. It's Mark. So, thanks for the question. Look, as we've stated, and more importantly, as we've committed, we've said that we're targeting $300 million of savings over the course of the three years through 2026. And we're confident in that. Doesn't mean it's in the bag, but it's an ever-evolving journey. And we think we have the right tools, we have the right culture that's in place, we're seeing changes in the organization, and we're starting to eliminate waste effectively. And again, it remains to be seen when you think about next year, what is inflation? We generally think of inflation as somewhere around 3%. And of course, we all know that could be up or down. But our goal is to mitigate some or all of that. And what I can say is, to date, and our performance indicates it, we are doing well on that track. And we're actually ahead of that track for 2024. So, a bit early to commit on what 2025 is going to look like, but we have a lot of runway, we have a lot of annualization from initiatives that started this year that will get the full annualization of next year. So, we're feeling comfortable on our targets. And we are laser-focused on this in eliminating that waste, but preserving the entire guest experience and the product that we're known to deliver. James Hardiman : Got it. And then obviously, it's way too early to really handicap 2025 in terms of some of the key sort of demand and cost factors. But I don't know if you could maybe help corral us in terms of some of the below-the-line items, as I think about interest expense, share count, DNA for next year. Obviously, your balance sheet is changing. You've got some converts. Any help with that math so we could all be maybe within the same ballpark? Mark Kempa : Yes, so first on share count, I think we've been guiding to about 515 million or 516 million fully diluted. And I would expect that number to be very similar next year because that does assume that all of our convertibles that are out on the horizon are converted to shares. That is not our intention, of course, for our 2027s, as we've always said. But the 2025 convertibles, we expect to convert to shares because we don't have another option. In terms of DNA and, you know, DNA, I think our DNA generally runs probably about 9.5% or so of gross revenue. And I would anticipate that it's probably going to be in that same zone going forward. And in terms of interest, again, I think we continue to make progress on the interest. We're guiding to, what are we guiding to, about 760 or so this year. And I think that's about, what is that, about 6.5% or so of gross as we continue to pay down debt, as hopefully we can take out some debt early, as we've potentially indicated with our 2024 December maturity. I think hopefully we can continue to see some improvement on that front. So I'm not going to give you a specific number on it, but think about where we are this year, 730, 740 or so. I think that would probably be a consistent percent of gross revenue or better. James Hardiman : Got it. Really helpful. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Lizzie Dove of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Lizzie Dove : Hi there. Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on a nice set of results. I just wanted to ask about kind of the algo, I suppose, for net yield. It feels like maybe the gross side of things in terms of onboarding ticket was a touch lower than expected, but really, really nice kind of commissions leverage that you got there. So I guess any change of how you're kind of thinking about that longer term, and I'll ask my follow-up now, is there, how much more room to go is there on that kind of commissions leverage that you're getting? And is that really just coming from more direct bookings, changing demographics that you're seeing? Any help there would be great. Thank you. Harry Sommer : Yes. So thank you, Lizzie, and we've seen the questions in your initial report this morning, too, so we appreciate the heads up on it. So I'll just say at a high level, I understand how you drew the conclusion you did that the benefit was based on commission or direct bookings or something like that. But I just want to explain that what's not the case. The entire benefit we saw in that line was as the result of better air purchasing. So, we bundle air on Oceania region, NCL and anywhere between 35% and 60% of our guests depending on the brand and the regions. And as we're able to buy air more effectively, we pass on the savings to the guests, which results in lower gross revenue and lower air costs that they would show up in the commission transportation and other line get better net revenue because we believe our air program is a competitive advantage in driving demand. So therefore, for us, having higher net revenue and lower gross revenue actually a huge benefit, which I think an analyst community misunderstands, they think with this kind of growth, it's actually a benefit. It means we're buying air more effectively, again, tackling on those savings to the guests, which allow us to have a more robust demand environment. In terms of how much more leverage there may be on buying air better? Listen, we have a team what they do. They -- we continue to do our best to contract with new carriers, especially both on the domestic and international front. That gives us more choices to offer our guests. So I do not think we have run the entire course. I could sort of -- although it doesn't necessarily show up in cost, so it is officially part of the transformation office for the $300 million that Mark mentioned, clearly find air better and providing that benefit to the guest is a long-term benefit for the company. Lizzie Dove : Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Harry Sommer : I think we have operator time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Pulitzer of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Daniel Politzer : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on that, the difference between gross and net. As we think about kind of the remainder of the year, and obviously you've given that net yield guidance, should we think about that transportation and airfare cost continuing to be down year-over-year? Or, should kind of gross and net be, changing at a similar pace for the rest of the year? Mark Kempa : I think, Dan, generally speaking, to the extent we can continue to improve on that line item, we're going to continue to improve on it. Obviously, we are at the mercy of some of the market volatility in terms of whatever air does. But I think it's a good assumption to assume that we're going to continue to work hard on that and see improvements. So a bit of a not exact answer, because I think there is some variability there, but I think we're going to continue to see improvements there. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then, obviously, you reach your year-end target for leverage, pretty much in this quarter. How should we think about the year-end net leverage target at this point? If there's any way to just kind of help us as we think about the, working capital and those other moving pieces in terms of your balance sheet and cash flow? Mark Kempa : Yes, I think the way to think about it is it provides us another solid milestone toward our 2026 target of mid-fours. I think generally the models out there know what our debt is, net debt is. And I think you have a good handle on obviously where our EBITDA is. So we are making progress and we think by year-end we're going to see significant improvements in that quarter after quarter. Daniel Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. Harry Sommer : Okay. So once again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around to answer any questions you may have. Have a great day and we look forward to seeing you in our next call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Sarah Inman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Sarah. Sarah Inman : Thank you and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and CFO. As a reminder this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhlpd.com/investors. Throughout the call we were referred to a slide presentation that can be found on our website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2024 results was issued this morning and is available on our website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with a cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Harry. Harry? Harry Sommer : Well, thank you Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2024 earnings call and Happy Halloween. I'm extremely pleased with our results as Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings continues to make steady and meaningful progress driving and leveraging the strong demand environment, while delivering exceptional vacation experiences all while effectively controlling our costs thanks to the dedicated efforts of our shipboard and shoreside teams. I am delighted to say for the third straight quarter we have achieved results that surpassed our guidance across all key metrics which has led to an increase in our full year guidance for a fourth time this year. These results demonstrate how our strategic direction is yielding positive results now and positioning us well for the future progressing steadily towards our 2026 financial and sustainability targets. As you recall from our Investor Day earlier this year we unveiled our Charting the Course strategy with the vision to have our guests vacation better and experience more and which focused on what I refer to as the four p's people, product, growth platform, and performance. I would like to take the opportunity today to share our progress on several fronts of this strategy. I'll begin my remarks by highlighting our performance pillar through both our strong third quarter results and providing an update of our full year outlook. Next, I'll discuss recent developments in our exciting new build program part of our growth platform as well as new initiatives on all three of our award-winning brands part of our product pillar. I will also comment on the strong demand we are seeing and how our onboard offerings and service quality continue to drive improved guest satisfaction, while maintaining disciplined cost management, the balancing of return of investment, and return on experience that is one of the core tenets of our strategy. And last but not least, I'll cover some of the key advancements in our sustainability efforts which underpins each pillar of our strategy. I'll then turn the call over to Mark, who will provide more detailed commentary on our results and updated guidance. First, I am pleased to report that our strong momentum for the first half of the year a combination of the continued focus and execution by our teams on our strategic initiative and successful cost efforts coupled with sustained robust demand has continued into the third quarter resulting in exceptional performance. As illustrated on the Slide four we not only met but exceeded our guidance across all key metrics for a third straight quarter. We achieved the highest quarterly gross revenue and adjusted EBITDA in our company's history and the highest trailing 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin since returning to regular operations improving almost 10 full percentage of points from the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted EPS increased 31% to $0.99 well ahead of our guidance of $0.92 despite a $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and our higher adjusted EBITDA drove net leverage to end the quarter at 5.58x an approximate one- and three-quarter turn improvement over just the last nine months from year-end 2023. Slide five lays out the effect of our strong third quarter guidance third quarter results on our full year guidance. While Mark will provide more detailed commentary shortly, I would like to highlight a few key points on our full year numbers. We are projecting net yield to increase 9.4% this year marking 120 basis point improvement from our previous guidance as we carry forward strength from the third quarter and raise our fourth quarter guidance. This impressive growth is expected to be a record for the company since going public in 2013 and is truly exceptional. Our adjusted operational EBITDA margin is expected to improve to 35.3%, 4.6 percentage points over 2023 and a significant step towards our goal of approximately 39% in 2026 driven by strong top-line growth and our flat adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel and dry dock during the year. We expect our adjusted ROIC to close the year in the double digits, an improvement from 8% in 2023 demonstrating we are well on our path to 12% by 2026. And lastly, we expect our net leverage to further decrease to approximately 5.4x by year-end a major step towards achieving our 2026 target of mid 4x. Each of these year-end metrics demonstrates that we are on track to achieve our 2026 charting the course targets and reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction and ability to execute. Turning to Slide 6 which I know you are familiar with I want to once again highlight how our long-term growth platform pillar is set to deliver measured capacity growth and optimize our fleet to drive strong financial returns. Historically measured capacity growth has driven outsized revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, and we expect this trend to continue with the additions of new vessels to our fleet. I'll provide more details on these exciting developments as we turn to Slide 7. At Norwegian, we recently unveiled what in 2026 will be the 21st ship in our fleet, Norwegian Luna. This exciting addition will launch a variety of fun and fun voyages sailing round-trip from Miami starting in April 2026. As a sister ship to Norwegian Aqua, Luna boasts exciting enhancements over previous Prima class ships including a 10% increase in capacity, luxurious new three-bedroom duplex haven suites, a groundbreaking hybrid roller coaster water slide that will debut next year on Norwegian Aqua, new activities and games for our guests, and a new revitalized service at the Mandara Spa and Salon and Pulse Fitness Centers. Speaking of Norwegian Aqua, we're making excellent progress towards your launch in early 2025. Earlier this month I visited the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy and witnessed firsthand the impressive final touches being applied to the vessel. I'm incredibly excited for our guests to experience this next generation Prima class ship. At Oceania Cruises, we remain committed to delivering the finest cuisine at sea with new experiences on every new build. In this case, I'm sorry, in the case of the brand's upcoming Allura, we are introducing the Creperie for which Oceania's newly appointed executive culinary directors and resident master chefs of France, Alice Coretti and Eric Burrell, have crafted over 20 exquisite recipes. I'm eagerly anticipating our food loving guests reaction to this new exciting culinary experience when Allura debuts next year, and of course I'll be first in line. Finally, Regent Seven Seas Cruises recently celebrated the steel cutting for its latest ultra luxury ship, Seven Seas Prestige. At 77,000 tons and accommodating only 850 guests, this vessel will offer our guests unrivaled space at sea with one of the highest guest to space ratios in the industry. The ship will introduce exciting innovations including a reimagined palatial region suite, a new set of duplex suites and other accommodation categories, fresh dining experiences and numerous other incredible offerings that will allow our guests to experience luxury transcended. Moving to Slide eight, we have enhanced our offering and partnership building on our bold aspiration for our guests to vacation better and experience more. Norwegian launched its new brand positioning, Experience More at Sea, which underscores NCL's commitment to provide guests with more variety, more to see, more to do, more to enjoy and more value through elevated offerings providing more of what they love while vacationing. The More at Sea offering is an evolution and expansion of the previous Free at Sea package now with an enhanced beverage package, additional nights at specialty dining venues and Starlink high-speed internet. In addition to its new positioning, Norwegian also unveiled its latest partnership as the official cruise line of the National Hockey League. This milestone marks NCL's first partnership with the Professional Sports League and the NHL's first partnership with the cruise line. This multi-year partnership provides a fantastic platform for the brand to connect and engage with hockey fans everywhere and show them how they can experience More at Sea with NCL. Oceania, meanwhile, unveiled its new brand value promise and offering, Your World Included, which features an updated selection of always included amenities for our guests. As part of the new brand promise, guests will now have a generous suite of amenities included in the fare including gourmet specialty restaurants, in-suite dining, prepaid gratuities, gourmet coffees and teas, laundry services and unlimited Starlink Wi-Fi, among others. These enhancements have helped drive increased demand and I'll now discuss our booking trends on Slide nine. Since our last quarterly update in July, the cruise consumer has continued to show strength. This resilience has allowed us to take advantage of the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter. Net yield grew 9% year-over-year and outperformed guidance by an amazing 260 basis points. This impressive performance was largely due to strength in pricing and demand across all geographies, but particularly in Alaska and Canon New England voyages. We also saw strong onboard revenue across the board, particularly in shore excursions and communications, the latter boosted by Starlink, which is already live on 30 of the 32 ships in our fleet and will be rolled out to the entire fleet by year end. In another sign of consumer health and confidence, pre-booked onboard revenue continues to improve up mid-single digits from the previous year and nearly doubling from 2019 levels. Looking ahead, we are at the upper end of our optimal range on a forward 12-month booked basis, and we continue to see strong demand for all brands and deployment with pricing and load for 2025 in line or above this year's levels for all four quarters and full year. Turning to Slide 10, we see the strength of our demand reflected in our advanced ticket sales, which increased 6% compared to the previous year, outpacing capacity growth. This achievement was driven by robust pricing, a dynamic deployment mix, increased pre-sale packages, and capacity growth. Moving to Slide 11, I will now dive into some of our advancements in sustainability, which underpins our strategy. We are committed to being responsible stewards of our environment while creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders and I'm proud to share some key highlights of our progress. This quarter, we received some significant recognition for our sustainability efforts. MSCI gave us a rating of A within the hotel and travel industry for the second year in a row. This recognition reflects our ongoing efforts to integrate environmental, social, and governance factors into our business practices. It's a testament to our dedication to transparency and responsible business practices. Additionally, at the ESG shipping award this year, we were the top-ranked company in the ESG leadership category and the only cruise line to even make the list. This accolade recognizes our outstanding achievements and innovative initiatives within the global maritime industry. It reinforces our position as a leader in sustainable cruising and motivates us to continue pushing boundaries in this area. Operationally, we also made significant strides in our alternative fuel initiatives. 41% of our fleet has now been tested with a biodiesel blend, surpassing our 2024 goal. This achievement underscores our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and exploring innovative solutions for cleaner operations. Finally, strengthening our communities is a key pillar of our global sale and sustain program, and we are committed to supporting organizations that benefit communities at large. During the third quarter, Oceania successfully launched the Relay for Life at Sea program on Oceania's Insignia and Vista. This initiative focuses on the wellness of our guests and crew by raising awareness through an onboard walk and encouraging donations to the American Cancer Society. We're excited to roll out this program to the remainder of the Oceania fleet later this year, further amplifying its positive impact. Additionally, in the wake of the destruction caused by both Hurricanes Milton and Helene, we contributed $80,000 to the American Red Cross to help those in affected communities. In addition to the $30,000 previously donated to the Red Cross to support Hurricane Helene relief efforts, we are matching up to $50,000 more in public donations towards Hurricane Milton relief efforts. These achievements demonstrate our fulsome and holistic approach to sustainability, encompassing environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and strong governance. As we continue charting the course towards a more sustainable future, we remain committed to innovation, transparency, and creating positive change in the communities we touch. With that, I'll hand the call over to Mark to go over financial results in more detail. Mark? Mark Kempa : Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our third quarter 2024 financial results, our increased full year 2024 guidance, and our increasingly solid financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2024 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis, and comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Let's begin with our third quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 12. Starting with the top line, results were very strong with net yield increasing 9%, exceeding our guidance of 6.4% by 260 basis points. Several factors contributed to the strong top-line growth in the quarter. First, exceptionally solid demand and pricing across our deployment, particularly for Alaska and Canada New England sailings across all three brands. Second, we experienced stronger than anticipated onboard revenue across the board, particularly in shore excursions and communications. The benefit of this higher pricing and onboard spend is compounded by the third quarter's seasonally high occupancy, resulting in outsized growth in the top-line and adjusted EBITDA. Moving to costs, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day came in $1 below our guidance of 155. This is primarily due to timing of certain expenses that will now shift into the fourth quarter. This resulted in record-breaking adjusted EBITDA for a quarter coming in at $931 million and surpassing our guidance of $870 million by over $60 million, while increasing year-over-year by approximately 24%. As a result, adjusted EPS was $0.99, exceeding guidance of $0.92 in the quarter, and increasing 31% compared to the third quarter of 2023, despite a $0.06 negative impact from FX in the quarter. We have seen strong results through the first nine months of the year, and along with improved expectations for the fourth quarter, we are increasing guidance for the full year, which I will discuss on slide 13. Looking first at net yield, in the fourth quarter, we are expecting growth of 6.9%, which is approximately 190 basis points better than our implied guidance last quarter. We are increasing guidance based on several factors, strong demand and pricing in the Caribbean, where we have 30% of our capacity in the quarter, and continued strong on-board revenue trends with healthy pre-booking for on-board amenities. These are very strong results considering the impressive 8% net yield growth we achieved in Q4 of 2023, and the headwinds from the rerouted Middle East sailings in 2024, which comprised approximately 10% of our deployment in the fourth quarter, and was disproportionately weighted to our higher-yielding brands. Moving to fourth quarter costs, we anticipate adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity today to increase by 2.7% to 155 from 151 in the same period of last year, and $1 above our previously implied guidance. This slight increase is mainly due to the timing of certain costs from the third to the fourth quarter, which I mentioned earlier. Excluding the $6 impact of dry docks in the quarter, our unit cost ex fuel will be down approximately 1% year-over-year. Reflecting these positive trends, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance is increasing to approximately $445 million. These results are driving our adjusted net income to approximately $40 million, and a return to positive adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be approximately $0.09, considering a share count of $445 million, resulting in a positive adjusted EPS in all four quarters of the year. I want to remind you that at these net income levels, we expect that none of our exchangeable notes are dilutive in the fourth quarter, and there is no related interest expense add-back. Looking at full-year net yield, we are carrying forward the Q3 beat and are increasing expectations for the fourth quarter and now expect the full-year net yield to grow to 9.4%, which is 120 basis points better than our previous guidance and represents a record for the company. For adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel and excluding the impact of our dry docks, our guidance remains unchanged and is expected to remain flat year-over-year, despite the impact of inflation and increased variable compensation due to the strong performance of the business. As a result of the hard work and dedication of the entire organization, we continue to pace ahead of our target to deliver $100 million in savings in 2024. On adjusted EBITDA, full-year guidance is increasing to approximately $2.425 billion, and we have increased full-year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $1.65, which is a 136% increase over 2023 and marks significant progress toward our 2026, Charting the Course target of approximately $2.45. Slide 14 demonstrates how the hard work put in by our teams across the organization has resulted in significant improvements from our initial guidance to our current expected results for the year. Our full-year net yield growth expectation has increased 400 basis points from 5.4% to approximately 9.4%. We have maintained our cost guidance for the full year, which is expected to be flat year-over-year, excluding the impact of dry docks. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA guidance has increased $225 million to approximately $2.425 billion, and our adjusted EPS is increasing $0.42 to approximately $1.65. This performance stems from our ability to capitalize on strong demand while executing on our cost and efficiency initiatives. As Harry previously mentioned, 2024 is shaping up to be an extraordinary year, surpassing our optimistic expectations with record net yield growth. Looking to next year, based on current booking trends and our booked position, we continue to expect our full-year 2025 net yield will grow consistent with our algorithm discussed at our Investor Day. Now, a couple notes for modeling net yield in the first quarter of 2025. First, while we have a similar number of total dry dock days as the first quarter in 2024, due to the mix of vessels and the number of lower-yielding repositioning days, the number of capacity days related to this is 50% higher year-over-year. Second, as you recall, we had a very strong net yield growth of 16% in the first quarter of 2024, providing for a challenging comp in the quarter. The result of these two factors is that we expect first quarter 2025 net yield growth to come in lower than the full-year average. Looking at Slide 15, I want to dive a bit deeper into our margin enhancement initiatives. As outlined during Investor Day, a cornerstone of our strategy is to boost margins and reduce costs across the organization, while enhancing or maintaining the guest experience and product delivery. Our results speak for themselves, and we expect to continue executing on this algorithm as we close out 2024. We have been able to maintain our cost guidance throughout the year, and we continue to expect that adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day, will essentially be flat year-over-year, fully offsetting inflation, as well as increased variable compensation due to strong performance in the year. Our margin enhancement initiatives continue to yield significant results across the organization. As previously mentioned, we are pacing ahead of our target to reach $100 million of savings in 2024, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our $300 million of savings, which includes certain fuel initiatives through 2026. As we look ahead to 2025, building on our strong performance in '24, we remain committed to maintaining our unit costs below the rate of inflation, which supports our stated 2026 targets. Moving on to Slide 16, we can see how these cost-saving initiatives have positively benefited our margins. The last 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin for the third quarter improved approximately 900 basis points to 34.5%, and we now expect the full year to come in at approximately 35.3%. This continued progress sets us up well for our 2026 target and returning to margins of around 39%. Moving to Slide 17, I'd like to highlight the composition of our debt portfolio and some key developments in the quarter. While our leverage is still higher than we prefer, it is crucial to note that 55% of our debt consists of public debt, with the remaining 45% in the form of Export Credit Agency, or ECA financing, which is the primary source of financing for our ship orders. ECAs essentially provide a guarantee by sovereign governments, such as Italy, of the loans we obtain in connection with these ship orders, resulting in financing rates that are much more favorable than that of which would be secured in the capital markets. Looking ahead, we anticipate a gradual shift to a higher proportion of ECA financing as new ships come online and our remaining expected debt matures and/or is repaid. Additionally, we aim to further de-risk our balance sheet as we look at liability management opportunities going forward. We believe our strategic approach will optimize our capital structure and debt profile and continue to reduce our cost of capital over time. This quarter, we refinanced $315 million of notes due December 2024, with six and a quarter unsecured notes due 2030, with the remaining balance of $215 million to be paid at maturity. On slide 18, you can see our upcoming maturities. After we pay down the remaining balance of the $250 million of the 2024 notes in December, we have two components of debt to address on the horizon. First, our 2025 exchangeable notes, which we plan to settle in shares, and second, our $1.4 billion 5 7/8 notes due 2026, which will become current in the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, we have $600 million of 8 3/8 notes, which will become callable in early 2025, that we are evaluating as the rate environment continues to improve. Turning to leverage on Slide 19, we have continued to make progress on our net leverage, which ended the quarter at 5.58x, a 1.75x reduction from 2023 year-end. Moving leverage into the fives is another important step, and we continue to expect reducing leverage for the remainder of 2024, ending the year at around 5.4x, an important milestone in our path to achieving our 2026 target of mid-fours. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing comments. Harry Sommer : Well, thank you, Mark. I want to close by reminding everyone of the holistic strategy and ambitious targets that we laid out at our Investor Day, which are summarized on Slide 20. We are on track to end 2024 on an exceptionally strong note, marking our best year as a company since we returned to operations, and an all-time record adjusted net yield growth and record adjusted EBITDA. With this performance and our high visibility into future sales, we remain confident in our strategy. Looking into next year, we will continue to drive towards our Investor Day guidance of low to mid-single-digit net yield growth and sub-inflationary unit cost increases, positioning us well to achieve our ambitious 2026 Charting the Course targets. I want to express my deepest gratitude to our dedicated teams, both Shoreside and Shipboard. Their unwavering commitment and hard work have been instrumental to our success. As we look to the future, I'm filled with optimism about the opportunities that lie ahead for Norwegian Cruise Line holdings. With that, I'll hand the call back to the operator to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you, and I'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from James Hardiman from Citi. James Hardiman : Congrats on a really strong quarter here, particularly on the pricing front, which is where I really wanted to focus my questions. So if I'm doing the math right here, per diems, we'll call it 5% in the second quarter. That accelerated to 7% in the third quarter, which is obviously exceptional. The fourth quarter guidance, if I'm doing the math right, gets us back to that, call it 5% range, which is really good considering, Mark, just not long ago, we were having the conversation as to whether or not we would even be positive in the fourth quarter. But maybe walk us through some of the non-comparable headwinds and tailwinds of the last couple quarters. I'm just really trying to figure out on an apples-to-apples basis, are per diems accelerating, decelerating, staying consistently strong? How do I think through that? Mark Kempa : Well, good morning, James, and by the way, nice report that you issued a couple weeks ago. So, listen, I think as we look through to the fourth quarter in pricing, I think you nailed it. When we were talking about this two, three quarters ago, I think implied pricing was somewhere in the zone of flat to down 1%. But there's a couple important things to remind ourselves of that we're challenging or that we're going against. I recall Q4 of 2023, we did have pricing of 14%. So number one, we are rolling over a strong comp, and that translated to a yield of 8%. But we've also been able to continue to see strength in both our near term and Caribbean deployments. So we've continued to build upon that. And then I think what we also need to recall is that as a result of the Mideast disruptions late last year, we had an outsized proportion of our capacity that was originally scheduled for the Middle East in Q4, which represented about 10% of our overall capacity and was disproportionately weighted to our higher ending brand. So given the fact that we're now showing pricing of around 5% yield of almost 7%, I think, we feel this is a great, great improvement, and certainly somewhere where we can continue to build upon. James Hardiman : Got it. Thank you. And then, I wanted to talk a little bit about the Analyst Day guidance, and in particular that the delta between yields and costs, which I found to be a pretty helpful sort of rubric. As of the Analyst Day for this year, that delta was maybe 4%, not even, it now stands at 6%, right, if you're going to grow yield 9.5 and cost 3.5, call it. You're looking at a 6% delta. I guess as we roll that forward to next year, does that make it more difficult to see significant deltas? And in particular, your 2.5 point, it seems increasingly likely that you're going to do that over the three-year period. But is that even possible as we think about 2025? Basically trying to figure out if there's been some pull forward of that. Because ultimately, if you maintain that delta, I think you're going to comfortably exceed that 245 earnings target for 2026. Harry Sommer : Sure, James, this is Harry, and I'll take that one. I think the rubric was, as you mentioned, just a way to easily see through how we can get to 2026. But what we're focused on is the actual 2026 numbers, the operational limit of margin approaching 39%, EPS at 245, mid-floor leverage and a record ROIC in the neighborhood of 12%. And I think seeing the performance this year, and it's been six months since we introduced these targets, so we obviously now have better visibility to 2025 as well, just allows us to be more optimistic and more certain about our ability to obtain the numbers. So I focus a little bit less on any specific rubric and more on the four numbers that we've given out there. We are fully committed and optimistic about obtaining these numbers in 2026. Mark Kempa : And James, I'll add to that. One of the cornerstones of that is, and we've reiterated today, is that we intend to deliver sub-inflationary unit cost growth. And as we've talked about in the past, we have a 300 million plus program in place. We are on pace with that. In fact, we continue to be ahead of our pace with that. So we increasingly feel more and more confidence around that. So we're lining up the pieces, but as Harry said, we're focused on those four key metrics at the end of 2026. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Brant Montour from Barclays. Your line is now live. Brant Montour : So the first question is on bookings, color. You guys gave some color and it was well appreciated. Maybe we can go one layer deeper and talk about 25 booking strength. And maybe you can talk about that through the lens of the different brands, the different geographies, the quarters. I know you said you're up in all four, but any quarter standing out and then you sort of demographics in your database, though I think that would probably correlate with your brands, but any extra color would be helpful. Harry Sommer : Yes. So thanks, Brent, for the question. This is Harry again. I'll tell you, we've really fine-tuned our revenue management tools. So we managed to book in curve, we managed to maximize yield. And I can't say that we see any discernible pattern across the brands or across geographies or across, for that matter, the sourcing of guests that stand out for the positive or negative. Broadly based, everything is progressing exactly as we'd like it to be. Clearly, we continue to see this robust close in demand, which allows us to sort of reconsider our booking curves over time, because obviously we want to take advantage of it. We said before, we don't focus on record book position. We focus on record yield. I think the quote I made in last year's call is like, I can't take book position to the bank. I can only take book yield to the bank. And that's 100% of our focus. So get back to your question. We see good, solid, in line with our expectation bookings, both on a load and pricing factor for 2025, in line with the overall commentary we gave in setting our charting the course targets of moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, slump inflationary cost growth, as Mark mentioned, with the goal of continuing to improve our margin, drive strong cash flows, and de-lever our balance sheet. Brant Montour : Okay, that's great. Thank you for that, Harry. And then the second question is on the booking curve. You guys said that you're in the upper end of the optimal part of your curve. I'm just curious if that optimal curve, that optimal point has evolved over time, pre-COVID versus post-COVID. And if you've had to recalibrate that downward at all, just because, you didn't want to leave money on the table, the strength of the demand you're seeing, and sort of again, an upward pricing environment and travel. Any extra color on sort of how you're managing that and what optimal means? Harry Sommer : Sure. So I think I covered part of it in my last comment, but let me reiterate or react to, I think, both the sub points. I think overall, coming out of COVID, clearly there was some uncertainty, and we were looking to push the booking curve a little further in advance in order to take risk off the table. We didn't know what we didn't know. Clearly, we have now seen a few quarters in a row of robust close in demand, which is a little different from what we saw last year, where the close in demand certainly wasn't as good as we were hoping for, which has allowed us to beat for the last few quarters, as opposed to last year, where it was a little bit more challenging. So that being said, 100% are booking curve thoughts evolve over time. But I also want to stress, Brant, that booking curve, it's not one static number. It varies by itinerary. It varies by brand. I mean, you know this, but I say it for the record. And we have teams that look at this all day, every day, and take into account the latest information to set it. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we are further booked ahead than we were pre-COVID, but we don't think we need to have records. We don't think we need to continue to push the booking curve further, especially in line with this robust close in demand that we've been seeing the last few quarters. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Steven Wieczynski from Stifle. Your line is now live. Steven Wieczynski : So I want to ask a bigger picture question, if I can, to start here. And if we think about cruise yields historically, they've grown, call it in that low single-digit range. Based on some of the changes that you guys have talked about, and that could be cabin design, shorter itineraries, enhanced revenue management scale, all that kind of stuff, is it fair to think that, there's a good chance, you guys and probably the industry as well could start to see yield growth, well in advance of that low single-digit historical rate? Harry Sommer : So clearly, Steve, it is our goal to grow yields as fast as we can. But I think the algorithm that we've discussed, many times of low to mid-single yield growth with low inflationary cost growth, et cetera, is what we're sticking to, to the time being. Obviously, we do everything in our power, Steve, to have yield go up as much as possible. But I think what we're prepared to look based on what we see, based on our crystal ball, for lack of a better term, is continue with that same algorithm we've been talking about for a while now. 2024 was a little bit of an unusual year in a positive way, and we're thrilled for it, and we're thrilled with our results. But I think longer term, that's what we stick with, low to moderate capacity growth, low to mid-single-digit yield growth, low inflationary cost growth. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And then second question is going to go to the cost side of the equation. And Mark, obviously, you kind of talked about that $300 million in cost savings between now and in 2026. And in your prepared remarks, you noted that you're going to exceed kind of that third goal of $100 million so far this year. So, as you kind of sit there and kind of continue to go through your cost structure, based on what you guys have identified already, I'm going to ask this in a way you might give me an answer, but is it fair to think when it's all said and done that $300 million might end up being low or conservative? Mark Kempa : Yes. Good morning, Steve. So I certainly wouldn't want to get that far ahead of ourselves in terms of being low or conservative. What I will tell you is, we have done a very good job at identifying the goals that we have set out. And further, what we've said is this is not a one-time exercise. This is a multi-year journey. So, we are focused on looking at every process in the business from end-to-end, not just looking for any low-hanging fruit, all while protecting the guest experience and the product delivery. So, look, we're six, what are we, six, seven months into our stated goals and targets. We're feeling increasingly confident on our path toward that. And hopefully, early sometime next year, we can give further progress on where we stand if it's large or conservative, but we're feeling good with where we are today. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Matthew Boss : Thanks, and congrats on a great quarter. Harry Sommer : Thank you, Matthew. Matthew Boss : So, Harry, maybe could you elaborate on the strong momentum that you cited, any notable outliers by brand or region, and any signs at all of softening as you look into '25? Harry Sommer : Matthew, I think I commented a little earlier on this, so I'll keep my comments on this short. Really, it's across the board. We're happy with all three of our brands. We're happy with all geographies. We're happy with all get-sourcing markets. It's hard to see any cracks. I don't want to get ahead of our skis. As I've mentioned before, we're focused on this low- to mid-single-digit yield growth, so my commentary is reflective of those numbers. I don't want to be irrationally exuberant, if you will, about 2025, but we are absolutely happy with what we're seeing today. Matthew Boss : Great. And then, Mark, maybe just to circle back to your 250 basis point yield-to-cost target spread, maybe how best to think about the linearity of cost next year if yields were to come in above your initial plan? Mark Kempa : Yes, good morning, Matt. So I think we've always said, generally speaking, when we think about our 300 million plan. Generally, we laid it out as roughly about 100 million per year, right? That may vary up or down marginally, but I think something that's important to note, and we've probably been pretty public about saying this, is that if we're able to exceed that low-to-mid-single-digit yield growth in a year, that does not necessarily translate that we are going to go and spend more money. We are focusing on right-sizing and leveraging the scale of this business, and part of that includes right-sizing our unit cost base. So, we're focused on that, but that does not have any direct correlation in terms of outperformance on yield. Harry Sommer : I mean, it's really, that point that Mark makes is really important. These are independent factors, where we're targeting the low-to-mid-single-digit yield growth, we're targeting below-inflationary cost growth. If yield is better or worse, seeing how the year shapes up, we will continue to target below-inflationary cost growth, and we've seen a culture change in the company towards this balance of return on investment and return on experience, which we talked about at Investor Day. We are super focused and passionate on delivering a great experience, but on things that guests truly care about and things that generate positive ROI for the company. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Connor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is now live. Connor Cunningham : I'm going to ask the yield question a different way, maybe. So when you say low-to-moderate yield growth, should that be viewed as kind of your core pricing outcome? The reason why I ask is that every cruise line has talked about how they've left money on the table. The question here is just more around what's the swing opportunity as you get better at yield managing now that you have bookings back to historical levels? Thank you. Harry Sommer : I think there were two or three sub-questions there, so I'm going to try to do my best to remember them and answer them. Yes, I think most of the yield change that you're going to see in 2025 is going to be on pricing. I don't expect any material change in occupancy. Of course, we're not giving 2025 guidance yet, but I think essentially we are fully sold on a cabin basis, so I don't see that swinging much. If it does swing, it's based on the number of children that we take primarily on the NCL brand, which doesn't meaningfully contribute to revenue from a big picture perspective. The second part of your question, someone remind me, was about swing opportunities to get better at revenue management. How do I say this? There's no evolutionary changes to our revenue management that's coming up. We just do our best day in and day out to get slightly better at what we do, which is part of what builds to our stated algorithm of low- to mid-single-digit yield bill, keeping in mind that we do continue to increase the capacity of the company by between 4% to 6% a year as new ships come online. So I don't see huge opportunities here. Obviously, every day we work, and our goal is to maximize yield. I think there's another component, which is on-board revenue, which doesn't get talked much about because revenue management is primarily a tool that talks to ticket price, but we are trying, or I should say we're in the opening phases of doing better revenue management on our on-board product as well. And I think some of the close-in strength that you're seeing in Q3 and Q4, although it's very hard to parse it through the financial statements because of the way we bundle our product, but some of the strength that we're seeing in Q3 and Q4 is also, not only, but is also around our better revenue management, so to speak, on the on-board revenue, providing guests more opportunities, better marketing, better experiences to purchase on-board, which is generating revenue for us as well. Mark Kempa : More pre-sales. Harry Sommer : Thank you, Mark. Connor Cunningham : That actually dovetails into my follow-up question. What percentage of your customers today are doing pre-booked on-board spend? And then, what's the threshold? Harry Sommer : Nearly all of them buy something in front of the cruise, if you will. If you think about the robust things that we offer between drinks packages, dining packages, spa, shore tours, and the list goes on and on. I think those are mostly the big ones. Nearly every customer buys something before they get on the ship. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Vincent Ciepiel from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live. Vincent Ciepiel : As you look out over the next 12, 24 months as part of your long-term plan, how are you thinking about the trend line in occupancy? I know you, I think are a couple points shy of where it was historically, and some of that might be mixed. But as you're adding new Norwegian hardware in 2025 and 2026, do you expect occupancy to be a tailwind to yield growth in the next couple of years? Harry Sommer : I think I commented a little bit about occupancy in an earlier question. Our ships are essentially full from a cabin perspective. So the changes that we may see in occupancy, either positive or negative, would be mostly around third and fourth in the cabin, primarily children on the NCL brand, which don't really generate much revenue for us. So I don't see occupancy being a tailwind or headwind from that perspective going forward. I expect it to remain relatively stable, given our deployment, at least through 2025, where our deployment doesn't shift. Remember, we have talked about a slightly larger reliance on the [Caribbean] [ph] going forward, but we won't really see that until late 2025, but primarily for the 2026 results, somewhat based on the new PO that we're building at Great Sturkey, which will allow us to double the number of passengers we bring there in 2026 compared to more recent years. But I don't really see much happening on occupancy in 2025. Vincent Ciepiel : Great, thanks. And then another on costs, I think you called out one cue, having some headwinds on dry dock and repositioning days, which I think also maybe hinders yield a bit. But when you think about the full year impact on costs of dry docks this year, I believe it's about three points. When you look into next year, is dry dock, headwind, neutral, a tailwind to cost growth? Is this the new kind of baseline to utilize in years ahead? Mark Kempa : Yes, good morning, Vince. Yes. So you're absolutely right. On an annual basis, our dry docks year-over-year are relatively the same. So this is generally our consistent run rate post-COVID. Why we called out Q1 is because there is some timing issues within the year where even though we only have six more dry dock days than we did in the prior year, it actually represents 50% more capacity days. So that's not necessarily a call out in terms of cost. It's more of the impact that it will have on our overall comps and the yields for the first quarter. But again, that evens itself out over the course of the year. And that was why we had called that out in our prepared remarks. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is now live. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to go back and clarify, Harry, when you were talking about the long-term goals that your focus is really on the number in 2026, were you kind of suggesting that not every year would necessarily have the yield growth be 2.5 points higher than expense growth? So in other words, this year was a lot better than that piece of the algorithm. So next year could be less than 2.5 points. Was that what you were sort of communicating when you said your focus is on the absolute number in 2026, even if not every year looks the same to get there? Is that how we should interpret that comment? Harry Sommer : I think, Robin, that that's broadly correct. To be clear, we're not providing guidance for 2025 today. So I'm not going to comment on a specific number. But we're focused on these long-term targets for 2026, not on a specific spread in 2025 or 2026 individually. Of course, we don't expect the results to vary that much in these two-year periods based on the visibility we have today. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just also thinking about 2025, and you've mentioned expenses growing kind of sub-inflation. What do you broadly think of as inflation sort of today when you refer to that? Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yeah. Hi, Robin. So broadly speaking, when we look out, inflation obviously is a bit volatile. But something to keep in mind, it's not just U.S. inflation. We're a worldwide operator. So we look at global inflation. So we generally are thinking somewhere around the 3% zone based on what we see today. Now, obviously, that may change up or down as we go through time. But generally speaking, that's typically what we would associate as part of our longer-term plan. Harry Sommer : So thank you, Robin. And Kevin, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Your line is now live. Patrick Scholes : Harry, you mentioned just very briefly during this call about what's happening in the Great Stirrup Cay. Can you give us just a little more color where you stand with progress, any further thoughts on specific timing, and anything you can share above and beyond what may be next after the pier? Thank you. Harry Sommer : Sure. Happy to give you color on progress and status. So we announced that we were putting the new pier there earlier this year. I've been personally in Great Stirrup Cay a few times to see how things are going. And we feel really comfortable that we will remain on schedule to open the pier sometime in Q4. The team is really focused and doing an incredible job at building it. We're really happy to get that pier in because, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we believe it will allow us to utilize the island more, specifically, in the winter when it's a little bit more wavy in that region, and plan to double the guests that visit that island starting in '26 compared to where we are today, which should generate higher guest satisfaction, higher revenue, higher repeat rates. It becomes a virtuous cycle, so to speak, from that perspective. Listen, past that, we think the island's great. We have a great private beach. We have the great, I forget what it's called. I should better -- Silver Cove. Which is a great private, even-like experience on the island as well. Zip lines, jet skis, lots of interesting things for people to do. But I'll tell you, like with every asset in our portfolio, we are constantly reviewing this balance of ROI and ROX to see what we can do to get guests a better experience that will drive ROI. Have nothing to announce today, but we continue that analysis and that view towards the future. Harry Sommer : Okay. I think since your question was short, James, Kevin, excuse me, we'll have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is coming from Ben Chaiken from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now live. Ben Chaiken : Just one quick one. At the Investor Day, you flushed out a number of examples on the cost side. Would love any update here, if there's anything to share, and then specific areas in '25 that you see as opportunities. Thanks. Mark Kempa : Yes. Good morning, Ben. So look, it's very consistent with what we called out there. It's around looking at all of how we deliver our product from start to finish. Again, on the basis of we do not want to impact the product delivery or the guest experience. So, we are looking at every facet of the business, and more importantly, we're focused on things that the guests either don't value or that are invisible to the guests, so that we can ultimately provide more value to the guests. So, nothing, significant in terms of the overall categories to share, just other than we are looking at everything, whether it's on our ship side operations or at our shore side operations, in a very methodical and disciplined manner. Ben Chaiken : And then if I can squeeze one just very quick one in. I know you give us the year-over-year impact from dry docks, '24 versus '23, but any chance you can just high level give us some color on the distribution of dry docks in the year on an absolute basis, meaning 1H versus 2H? Mark Kempa : Yes. I think, Ben, we can probably follow up with that post call. We can certainly give you some color on that. Harry Sommer : So, once again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We were very pleased with our report, and hopefully you were as well. We'll be around today to answer any questions you may have. Thank you all. Happy Halloween. Happy Diwali and have a wonderful day. Bye, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
