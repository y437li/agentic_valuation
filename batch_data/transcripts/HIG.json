Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Just over 2 years ago, we launched The Hartford strategy to enhance shareholder value. Profitably [ph] grow the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses, reduced the size and risk of Talcott Resolution, and increased the company's operating effectiveness and efficiency. Our focus on executing that strategy has been unrelenting, and I am very proud of this -- of the substantial progress we've made in transforming The Hartford. Building a successful 2013, The Hartford outstanding first quarter results further demonstrate that our businesses are profitably growing through margin expansion and top line growth. In addition, the Japan sale, announced yesterday, is an important milestone in the company's transformation. This is an excellent transaction for shareholders, generating an estimated $1.4 billion capital benefit and sharply reducing The Hartford's risk profile by permanently eliminating the Japan variable annuity risk. Our policyholders in Japan will also benefit from a financially strong, strategic Japanese buyer. In evaluating the transaction, we examined a capital benefit compared to the economics of running the block off. We consider the permanent risk transfer and the likelihood of regulatory approval. After a comprehensive process, we concluded that the sale to Orix was clearly the right decision for the company. The transaction will accelerate the return of capital from Japan so we can be redeploy it for accretive activities were quickly. We will provide details about our plans for the capital benefit after the deal closes, which we expect to occur in July. The transaction also accelerates the transformation of The Hartford, putting greater emphasis on our successful efforts to profitably grow the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. This is an important transaction for The Hartford. With the return of capital from Japan and the permanent elimination of the VA risk there, The Hartford is much closer to achieving the strategic objectives we set out in 2012. The Hartford had an outstanding first quarter. Core earnings increased 23% to $564 million, or $1.18 per diluted share. Core earnings in the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses also increased 23% year-over-year. Disciplined underwriting and pricing continued to drive margin expansion in P&C and Group Benefits. Excluding a onetime expense benefit, CATs and prior year development, the total P&C combined ratio improved to 89.9 in the first quarter, a 1.9 point improvement over the prior year quarter. In Group Benefits, we continued to grow margins, recording a 50% jump in core earnings and an increase in the core earnings margin to 5.1%. As Doug will discuss later, renewal written price increases were strong in P&C Standard Commercial at 7%. Pricing increases remain well ahead of loss cost trends, which will drive future margin expansion. In addition to increasing profitability, we're beginning to generate improving top line growth across the P&C lines. New business premiums were up year-over-year in Middle Market and Consumer Markets and retentions are higher across the board even as pricing remains strong. In Group Benefits, sales increased 7% over the first quarter of 2013 for the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. In Mutual Funds, growth in assets under management drove core earnings up 5%. We were pleased to see positive net flows in Mutual Funds in the first quarter, a sign of growing momentum in the business. As Chris will elaborate, we continue to manage the balance sheet prudently. The aim of continued financial strength and flexibility while returning capital to shareholders and paying down debt. During the quarter, we repurchased $300 million of common stock and repaid $200 million of maturing debt. Across the company, we are driving improvements in operating effectiveness and efficiency, which you can begin to see in declining enterprise insurance and other operating expense levels. We are instilling a continuous improvement mindset to ensure that we operate more effectively and efficiently going forward. The first 4 months of 2014 represent an important turning point for the Hartford. With the sale of Japan, The Hartford is transforming into an insurance underwriting company with a smaller, less volatile, U.S. run off block in Talcott Resolution. The P&C Group Benefits and Mutual Funds team are delivering profitable growth. Outstanding first quarter results further demonstrate that the fundamental changes we made to how the company operates are working. We are creating a culture of execution of The Hartford and are well-equipped to compete effectively in our markets. We are focused on the work ahead as we continue to execute in The Hartford strategy. Thanks again for your interest in The Hartford, we look forward to sharing our continued progress with you. And I'll now turn the call over to Doug. Doug? Douglas G. Elliot: Thank you, Liam, and good morning, everyone. Commercial Markets is off to a strong start in 2014, and clearly building on the growing momentum established over the past several years. With an improving earnings profile, particularly in Middle Market, P&C and Group Benefits, our attitude towards growth has turned more positive across all our businesses. Let's begin on Slide 5. For the first quarter of 2014, P&C Commercial delivered $264 million of core earnings and a combined ratio of 91.2. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, this is an increase of $40 million in core earnings and a decrease of 2.8 points in the combined ratio. Current accident year CATs for the first quarter of 2014 were approximately $60 million. Significantly above the very light CAT quarter 1 year ago. Partially offsetting the increase in CAT losses was a onetime expense benefit resulting from changes in New York Workers' Compensation Board assessments. The underlying combined ratio excluding CATs and prior development was 87.7 for the first quarter of 2014, a decrease of 5.4 points versus the prior year. Excluding the favorable effects of the New York Assessments changes, the underlying combined ratio improved 2.2 points, reflecting our strong execution across all market segments. CAT losses for our Property & Casualty businesses this quarter were more heavily skewed to Standard Commercial lines. This is largely a function of our extensive Small Commercial business and low temperatures across the Midwest and Northeast, that resulted in a much higher frequency of burst water pipes that we normally see from winter storms. Turning to the top line on Slide 6. Our total written premium was up 1%. However, underneath this overall modest change, a very important story is unfolding for our P&C Commercial businesses. Adjusting for the $43 million written premium decline in our Programs business, which is a result of re-underwriting actions, P&C Commercial grew over 4%, the strongest quarterly growth we've seen in several years. Furthermore, we continued our relentless execution on written pricing gains, achieving a 7% increase in the quarter. Although down from 8% in quarter 4, we are nonetheless pleased with the general strength of pricing achieved. Importantly, pricing continues to outpace lost cost trends. New business momentum also continued, and in particular, I would note, our Middle Market new business premium was up 14% in the quarter. With this as a backdrop, let me share a few additional thoughts on each of our 4 business segments starting with Small Commercial beginning on Slide 7. Performance in Small Commercial continues to be excellent, with an all-in combined ratio of 85.7. Top line momentum is building, with policy retention improving to 83% and new business of $131 million for the quarter. Quotes for our business owners' package policy spectrum were up 12% in the quarter. Recall that we are introducing our commercial auto product on our new quote-to-issue platform in the coming months, completing our small product suite. This cutting-edge technology, with our market-leading products and outstanding distribution partnerships, has us poised for further PIF growth as we look out over the next several quarters. Moving to Middle Market on Slide 8. I continue to be pleased with our progress. Margin improvement has been our consistent focus over the last several years, and our first quarter underlying combined ratio of 90.1 paints a completely different picture than what we saw a few years back. After adjusting for the benefit from changes in New York Assessments, we're down 3.2 points from prior year. Renewal written pricing at 6% remain well ahead of loss cost trends and our account performance analytics continued to guide our pricing discipline. As I mentioned in our fourth quarter call, the environment has become more competitive over the last 6 months, but I would continue to describe the overall market as rational. Middle Market written premium was up 4% in the quarter, reflecting our improved go-to-market capabilities. Retention remains solid and new business of $111 million was up from $97 million in the first quarter of 2013. Our new business product balance is now consistently performing within our target range. With property, casualty and auto representing 2/3 of our new written premium. Most importantly, based on our aggressive pricing and underwriting actions over the past 30 months, the rate adequacy of our Middle Market growth has improved significantly, including worker's compensation. Turning to Specialty Commercial on Slide 9. National Accounts continue this top line momentum up 24%. Specific circumstances related to several individual accounts help drive this result. However, even adjusting for these, the underlying run rate is in the low-double digits. Our credit and underwriting standards remain rigorous. We estimate that available new business in the market was down slightly, but I was pleased with the new accounts we wrote in the quarter. As in prior quarters, with exceptional retention above 90%, our new accounts exceeded those either lost or non-renewed, a great organic result. Financial Products also had a solid quarter with 4% growth. Pricing remains positive in most sectors with the outlier large, commercial excess players where we see pricing declines. I remain positive on our progress here, and I'm pleased with another good 90 days. Re-underwriting efforts in our Program business remain a priority. We're making difficult yet appropriate financial trade-off decisions here, and I'm not concerned with the top line decline. Our financial outlook for the go-forward programs supported by revised underwriting and claims controls has significantly improved over the past 2 years. Now let's move to Group Benefits on Slide 10, where excellent momentum from 2013 continues. Core earnings in the quarter of $45 million, were up 50% from last year. Favorable long-term disability incident trends, continued strong recoveries and improved pricing, were all drivers in the quarter. In the February year-end call, I noted our strong persistency on January 2014 renewals. In fact, for the quarter, persistency in accounts renewing in our Employer Group Life and Disability business came in at 80%, up approximately 18 points from 2013. This strong performance produced a book consistency -- persistency of over 90%, which is 10 points improved from 2013. Looking at the top line. Fully insured ongoing premium declined 4% compared to prior year. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decision we made last year to exit an agreement with a third-party targeting sales through financial institutions. The impact on core earnings is immaterial, but we will continue to see premium decline throughout December 2014 when our exit is complete. Excluding the premium from this arrangement, our top line is down about 1% to prior year. Turning to New Business. Fully insured ongoing sales of $180 million, were 7% ahead of first quarter 2013. This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year sales. These financial results reflect our improved financial profile and market competitiveness. And critical to our strategy, this improved financial performance has also been recognized by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, all of which have recently reviewed the Group Benefits writing company and upgraded our ratings. We've been working aggressively to transition all Group Benefits business to Hartford Life and Accident, and these upgrades are important step as we work to grow this business. In closing, this was a very good quarter for us with strong top line and bottom line performance. I'd highlight that we continued to invest inside each of our business for 2014 and beyond. Technology is at the core of this agenda, but underwriting, product development and data analytics are equally critical. Our markets are continuing to evolve and these operating initiatives will strengthen our value proposition with customers and distributors. Coupled with the improving financial performance we delivered over recent quarters, we are optimistic about our strategic position as we move forward. Now let me turn the call over to Andy Napoli. Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli: Thanks, Doug, and good morning. Consumer Markets delivered strong first quarter results that continued the positive momentum created in 2013. During the quarter, consumer generated written premium growth of 6% year-over-year. Sequential policy growth in both auto and home, while simultaneously improving underlying margins. Let's start with margins. Overall, despite the winter activity that drove elevated non-CAT frequency across all lines, we produced 1.2 points of underlying margin improvement. In homeowners, winter storms and the unseasonably cold weather that hit the Eastern half of the country unfavorably impacted our non-CAT home loss ratio by 4 points. During the quarter, we experienced large increases in non-CAT weather claim frequency, particularly from frozen pipes. In auto, the weather also contributed to increased physical damage frequency. On the other hand, auto liability frequency and severity trends remained modestly positive. Finally, our expense ratio improved over a point compared to last year due to direct marketing efficiencies, coupled with the benefit of increased scale. Now let's move to the top line. Written premium growth for the quarter was driven equally by new business production and improving retention. Auto new business grew 20% with production coming from all channels. Agent ease of doing business is critically important to us and we spent a large part of 2013 working on new business throughput in this channel. Our team thoughtfully reviewed agency back and implemented numerous workflow improvements, resulting in a 7% increase in quotes and a 32% increase in issues over last year. These improvements helped drive auto new business production in AARP Agency and other agency, which grew 46% and 31%, respectively. Now let's shift to AARP direct top line, where new business grew 10%. This growth was largely enabled by a 29% increase in response, as we continue to optimize our direct marketing by driving leads for more cost effective, online sources. During the quarter, 78% of our responses came from online shoppers, up 7 points from a year ago. Our AARP direct marketing has improved significantly over the past couple of years, while leveraging better analytics and quicker test and learn capabilities to more efficiently target shoppers who will respond to our Hartford AARP offerings. Strong premium retention is also driving growth. Targeted renewal pricing and increased policy retention contributed to a 1 point increase in auto premium retention, including a 2 point improvement in agency auto. Home premium retention is also up 1 point. Overall, we are very pleased with our growth and we we're mindful of balancing that growth with a strong underwriting focus, managing both on a very dynamic basis from state to state to optimize our total return. Focusing on Auto. We're very happy with AARP growth in states like Florida, Illinois and Arizona, and agency growth in Texas, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. We also have some states who are actively managing like California, where we're taking both rate and non-rate actions to combat loss cost pressure and to decelerate growth a bit. In New York, where the rate we've taken combined with non-rate actions, for example, restricting new business flow through filters and comparative raters, our actions are working and new business growth has slowed. Consistent with our results this quarter, where the auto current accident year loss ratio was essentially flat with prior year, we're confident the actions we've taken and will take during the remainder of 2014, will continue to keep earned pricing ahead of lost costs. In closing, we're proud of our first quarter results continuing the momentum from 2013, improving margins, expanding top line growth and growing policies in-force. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2014, we'll actively monitor growth, we'll take rate to stay ahead of loss trends and implement other non-rate actions where appropriate. We are confident in our ability to achieve our 2014 objectives and that our core strategy remains strong and on track. I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher John Swift : Thank you, Andy. This morning, I'll cover several topics. First, I'll review first quarter 2014 results; second, I will cover the HLIKK transaction and its financial impacts; third, I'll provide updates on our legal entity realignment work; and finally, I'll cover our second quarter 2014 outlook. Let's begin on Slide 14. Last evening, we reported first quarter 2014 core earnings of $564 million, or $1.18 per share, up 23% from the first quarter of 2013. First quarter results included about $58 million after-tax, or $0.12 per diluted share of favorable items. These items included $26 million in after-tax, favorable prior year development, mostly from prior year catastrophes and $32 million after-tax for a reduction in assessments for the New York State Worker's Compensation Board. Current year catastrophes were in line with our outlook of $57 million after-tax. The addition to these items, limited partnerships returns were 13% annualized, or about $0.07 per diluted share higher than our 6% yield we are using for outlooking purposes. Turning to Slide 15. Consolidated net income for the quarter was $495 million or, $1.03 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $241 million, or $0.58 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. Hedging losses and credit impairments were modest, reflecting relatively stable capital markets and a favorable credit environment this quarter. Combined, our P&C group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses, generated core earnings of $452 million, up 23% from the first quarter of 2013. Doug and Andy covered their businesses, so I'll cover the rest. Mutual Funds core earnings rose 5% over prior year due to higher fees resulting from increased assets under management. Fund performance remains solid and we were ranked as a Top 10 Mutual Fund Family in the Barron\u2019s/Lipper survey for the second year in a row. With strong sales and improving redemptions, net flows were positive for the first time since 2011. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate a slight increase in redemptions due to the liquidation of our series of target date funds. These funds have approximately $700 million in assets under management, which reflects our decision to focus resources in areas where we can grow market share. Talcott's core earnings were $175 million, basically in line with our outlook after adjusting for limited partnership returns. U.S. VA surrender activity remained relatively consistent with policy accounts declining 3% sequentially, and an annualized surrender rate of 12.3% in the first quarter. This is slightly lower than the last few quarters, primarily because of the ESV program. We continue to explore policyholder initiatives for our annuity blocks. In mid-March, we launched a program that will ultimately be offered to about 84,000 contract holders with $5.5 billion of U.S. fixed annuity account values. The corporate segment had core losses of $63 million, compared with core losses of $73 million in the first quarter of 2013. The difference was principally due to a reduction in interest expense of about $12 million before tax, due to debt repayments in 2013. During the quarter, we repaid $200 million in maturing debt, consistent with the capital management plan we announced in February of this year. Turning to Slide 16. At March 31, 2014, The Hartford's book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $40.17, up 2% from year end 2013, and up 3% from March 31, 2013. The growth in book value per share reflects first quarter net income and the accretive impact of share repurchase during the quarter, which was modestly offset by dividends paid to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $8.8 million common shares for $300 million at an average price of $34.03 per share, or about 85% of book value excluding AOCI. Our core earnings ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2014 was 9.6%, which is above our expected run rate for full year 2014 of 8.7% to 9.2%. This increase was due to favorable limited partnership income and catastrophe losses over the past year. Yesterday, we announced the agreement to sell HLIKK, our Japanese annuity subsidiary for $895 million, or $860 million net of expenses and taxes. This is a good transaction at a good price that will eliminate our exposure to the Japan VA business. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals is expected to close in July and has a pro forma estimated capital benefit of $1.4 billion. The benefit is comprised of net proceeds from the sale of HLIKK, and an estimated net statutory capital benefit of $540 million in the U.S. resulting from the recapture of the Japan annuity risk to HLIKK. On a March 31, 2014, pro forma basis, the transaction would result in an after-tax GAAP net loss of approximately $675 million, and a U.S. Life Insurance company net statutory surplus loss of approximately $275 million. The deal is subject to a purchase price adjustment. The company's hedging program is designed to largely offset the effect of the purchase price adjustment and the expected capital benefit and we intend to continue the hedging program until closing. As a result of this transaction, effective in the second quarter, the Japan business will be classified as discontinued operations and will not be included in core earnings. Core earnings for Japan were $64 million this quarter, and were outlooked at $215 million for the full year. Going forward, Japan results will also include the results of hedging and changes in the purchase price adjustment and will be included in net income through discontinued operations until closing, which is expected in July of 2014. The estimated GAAP loss on the sale will be booked in the second quarter. After closing, The Hartford will have greater financial flexibility and a significantly reduced risk profile. We are evaluating how we will deploy the capital benefit from this transaction, including incremental capital management opportunities, and will update you on our plans after the transaction closes. Consistent with prior programs, we will evaluate both equity and debt options under any program. As Liam discussed, this sale is a major milestone for The Hartford, accelerating our transformation to a more focused insurance underwriting company and significantly reducing the company's risk profile. In addition, it will reduce future net income volatility as GAAP accounting did not fair value most of the Japan liabilities. Turning in to Slide 18. We have also made progress on our corporate structure realignment. During the quarter, we completed the Group Benefits legal entity separation project. Today, Hartford Life and Accident, or HLA, largely represents just the Group Benefits business. As part of this separation this quarter, HLA subsidiaries upstreamed an $800 million dividend to HLA in March. This capitalized the Group Benefits company in an RBC [ph] of approximately 400% as of March 31, 2014. After the realignment, HLA's former subsidiaries, Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity became subsidiaries of the Life Holding company. As Doug mentioned, after we completed the realignment, 3 rating agencies upgraded HLA, our market-facing Group Benefits company. Our second project involves White River Re. In the second quarter of 2014, we plan to dissolve White River, our Vermont annuity captive, and Hartford Life and Annuity recaptured the risk previously ceded to White River. This transaction has no impact on net holding company resources or consolidated U.S. life statutory surplus. In addition, this transaction simplifies our regulatory and reporting structure and improved our ability to manage Talcott's resources. Including the impact of HLA and White River realignments, pro forma March 31, 2014 RBC for Hartford Life Insurance Company and subsidiaries would be approximately 430%. Before turning to your questions, let me provide a brief summary of our second quarter outlook, which is on Slide 19. Bottom line, adjusting for certain items, we forecast the core earnings increase of 8% in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the second quarter of 2013. In total, our core earnings outlook for the second quarter of 2014 is $295 million to $320 million, or $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share, assuming 469 million shares outstanding. This outlook does not include Japan annuity core earnings of approximately $55 million dollars or $0.12 per diluted share, which will be reported in discontinued operations. Talcott's earnings, excluding Japan, are outlooked at $80 million to $85 million for the quarter and include about $15 million after-tax for expenses associated with policyholder initiatives on the U.S. annuity book. This outlook assumes catastrophe losses of $120 million after-tax, which is about equal to our actual experience in the second quarter of 2013. The second quarter is generally our highest CAT quarter, and May and June are 2 of our most active CAT months, particularly for tornadoes and thunderstorms that are still to come. We extend our sympathies to all those affected by Sunday's tornadoes and yesterday's storms in the Midwest and Midsouth. As usual, the outlook does not include any estimates for prior year development, except for the accretion of discount on workers comp. We complete our annual ground-up asbestos environmental reserve studies in the second quarter. To wrap up, let me just reiterate that we are off to an outstanding start in 2014 with strong financial results from our P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses and a transaction milestone with the Japan announcement. Our capital position is very strong, with a $600 million improvement in statutory surplus this quarter, reflecting positive statutory earnings in both Life and P&C. I'll now turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session. Sabra R. Purtill: Thank you, Chris. We have about 30 minutes for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Lisa, could you please give the instructions for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore. A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : I guess my first question is on the transaction and kind of the earnings outlook that you talked about. I guess, how much in stranded costs get -- or shared services cost get reallocated? And is it too early to start talking about an expense plan in terms of kind of dealing with those? Liam E. McGee: I'll let Chris and/or Beth take the details of that question. But Mark, I think as we demonstrated with our sales of the Life and Retirement Plans businesses as well as our broker-dealer, we are always determined to eliminate costs that are associated with businesses we sold. And I think our success to date in those businesses are supportive of that concept. With that, I'll have Chris and Beth give you the details that you asked for. Christopher John Swift : Thank you, Liam. I think your point is right on. I think, Mark, if you put into context that HLIKK was really a standalone business unit in Japan, reallocated a small amount of holding company expenses to Japan. When I mean small, you think in terms of $20 million, $25 million after-tax -- or excuse me, pretax. And we'll put that part of our efficiency objectives and we'll get out as quickly as we can, but it's relatively small. A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then Chris, just what happens to the hedging cost? I mean I know that 70 basis points likely goes away, but is there an opportunity to take down the macro hedge as well? And if so, how much of that save the strain in the -- below the line? Christopher John Swift : Mark, from the hedging side, I will just reiterate, we are going to continue to hedge from now until closing. That's important as we try to lock in our capital benefit. I think as you forward, in U.S. block, we still spend at 30 to 40 basis points of hedging cost. The macro program cost is approximately $75 million. So I do think we'll have the opportunity, with Bob Rupp's leadership, to recalibrate our U.S. hedging programs. And that's on the list, and we'll update you as we modify it going forward. A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just finally, Andy, is the expense ratio improvement in Consumer sustainable? Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli: Mark, this is Andy. Yes, we believe that we should sustain 1.4 point improvement throughout the year. Operator : And our next question comes from John Nadel from Sterne Agee. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : I have a question. I know you don't want to address sort of the deployment of the capital until the deal actually closes. But I guess my question is this, should we think -- how should we think about those proceeds in the capital freed up from the sale? And by that, I mean, is it fair for us to look upon those proceeds as completely unencumbered and available to the holding company, either directly as it relates to the sale price or, over time, as it relates to getting the dividends out of the life co? Christopher John Swift : John, it's Chris. How about if I frame it that the $1.4 billion capital benefit is obviously the gross impact of that combination. I think when you think about it, what we announced our capital management plan for 2014 and '15, you would say as our thinking, this transaction overlaid with that plan. We would say that there's an incremental $1 billion of capital that will be available to supplement that plan. And as you know, we're going to work on it with -- we're going to work on closing the transaction first and then, simultaneously, that will work on our plans. And again, consistent with our past actions, I think we demonstrated the ability to be balanced to achieve our deleveraging goals while returning excess capital to shareholders. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Yes, that's fair. I just wanted sort of an affirmation, if you will, that the net proceeds here over what you had already assumed in your $2 billion outlook was indeed unencumbered. And I guess it's fair for us to assume that, right, given the 400% RBC at the group company and the 430% at Talcott on a pro forma basis. Correct? Christopher John Swift : Yes. I mean, the way we think about it is the capital that's in the U.S. entity, we'll work with our regulators to do an extraordinary dividend to get it out. The cash that's going to come from the sale of the legal entity in Japan will go directly to the holding company. But all that totals in incremental billion dollars compared to our announced plan. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then if I can just sneak one more in. I kind of hate asking about the Corporate segment on the conference call, but as you look at that $63 million operating and core operating loss in Corporate this quarter, can you give us some help on where we should expect that to trend given the debt reductions as well as your expectation for incremental expenses from here? Christopher John Swift : Yes. John, I'm looking at the supplements. So I always think in terms of -- at the Corporate segment, there's about $60 million to $70 million of pretax operating expenses up there in addition to the interest expense -- yes, for the year -- I'm sorry, that's for the year. So that will continue to be there, with the -- just the catchfall from some unallocated expenses to the line. So think about it as $50 million to $60 million for an annualized basis pretax within there going forward. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. So most of the expenses that we should see from here then are truly in the operating units? Christopher John Swift : Clearly. I mean that's where all the action is. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent DeAugustino from KBW. Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : I'll just start off with Doug real quick. I'm just curious if you're seeing any shifts in quote submissions that might indicate that your clients and agents are becoming more complacent with, call it, mid-single-digit rate increases since we're also seeing a concurrent modest rise in retentions as well? Douglas G. Elliot: Vince, I would describe the operating environment the last 60 days as relatively consistent. So I don't see any major changes out there. Excited about the progress we made in the quarter, sales achieved across our businesses, as I noted, really positive signs for the franchise. But I still see a very rational environment that is allowing us to compete effectively. Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : All right. Good. And Andy, you've already provided some information on the non-CAT non-weather. But I guess the question would go to both Doug and you. But clearly, the winter weather was a drag on the CAT line, and I'm just curious of any thoughts on weather outside of the catastrophe line. There might be some benefit across the writing [ph] lines like auto and workers comp, or some of these frigid temperatures may have weighted on whether it be discretionary driving or construction activity. I'm just looking at some other things in the economy, and we see it in retail sales, home starts, tons of things that are impacted here. And I'm just wondering if there's some also non-CAT, non-weather accident frequency benefits here in the quarter that's benefiting the quarter [ph] line loss ratio that we should maybe thinking about normalizing out or just breaking that down would be helpful. Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli: Okay. Vince, this is Andy. I'll address for Consumer and then hand it off to Doug. So let me talk about homeowners first. So we did see an abnormally large increase or spike in freezing pipe claims, so we got to deal with that. And so, when will that repeat itself towards the end of this next year, into next year. The long-term 3- or 4-year trend for non-CAT weather has been slightly negative. And so I view that, as the year plays out that, that trend should continue despite what happened in the quarter with the frozen pipe claims. What's more interesting, at least to me, is what's happening in auto. So we observed a sharp increase in collision frequency that we attribute largely to ice and snow throughout the Northeast and Midwest. And what's interesting about it is we did not see a corresponding increase in auto liability frequency. But that said, that's something that we're paying really close attention to, as we come out of the cold weather period, to see if the collision frequency drops off and auto liability frequency remains modest. That help? Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : It does. Douglas G. Elliot: Vince, let me add a few points to that. One is we had some pressure on our non-CAT weather inside Commercial Markets in the first quarter. Not big, big numbers, but clearly states that we're borderline, ISO-defined CAT-ers, et cetera, so a couple of points of pressure there inside our property lines. Secondly, we feel we also had some frequency in the auto line just because of weather. So we had commercial drivers out on the roads for extra hours, et cetera. And we know, as we look at geographies, it had some pressure in the quarter. And the last piece I'd throw to you, maybe a contrarian thought to you. In comp, we think we saw a little bit in the frequency area just based on weather. So whether it be employees on the job sites with more challenging temperatures, ice, et cetera. So we actually looked at our first quarter frequency numbers and comp and think we saw a little bit of lift in areas that had those adverse temperatures. Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay. So to your point on being contrarian, we should maybe actually think about this at least being sustainable, if not potentially getting some improvement throughout the rest of the year based on all the rate and non-rate actions as well. Douglas G. Elliot: That's fair. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Two questions. You had mentioned in the U.S. VA book an offer that you're putting out to contract holders of -- if you can give more detail on that. And then on the Property & Casualty side, I guess really on the Commercial side, this was the first quarter that I can recall, where there was no adverse reserve development in any major line of business. And I'm wondering if you're seeing in some of these liability lines better claims trend, or is it simply that, \"Hey, we've gotten the reserves where they need to be,\" at this point? Liam E. McGee: Okay, Jay. We'll have Beth take your first question on U.S. annuity offers -- customer offers. Beth A. Bombara: Great, thank you. Yes, so in markets, as Chris outlined in his remarks, we did start an offer related to our fixed annuity block. This offer is going to cover about $5.5 billion of account value. These fixed annuities, think of them as offering minimum interest rate guarantees of around 3%. And so, with this offer, we're offering policyholders an enhancement and increase to their surrender value as they would surrender their contract. Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And Beth, what's the expectation as far as what that should produce as far as surrender value -- surrender rate? Beth A. Bombara: Yes. It's early to tell right now. As I said, we just started the first launch in March. And for the first wave, currently we're experiencing about an 8% take rate. So we modeled that we thought, in total, we'd get somewhere in the 10% to 15% surrender rate. Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And the development? Christopher John Swift : Jay, it's Chris. Yes, on the adverse development, I'll add my comments and Doug might have a view. I think you're kind to notice that we've worked hard to getting the balance sheet right and we believe it is right. I would also tell you that I think we have better collaboration amongst the financial reserving actuaries and the business actuaries, Doug and myself, so that our current year picks, at least over the last 2 years, I think we are more confident about those picks. There's more real time data that goes into our planning process and quarterly process. So Doug, I think we feel that the process that we go through is just tighter, more realtime and better data and to give comfort out on those picks. Douglas G. Elliot: Jay, I would totally agree with Chris' comments. We just feel very good about the process and we jumped on issues early. Just we're solid about where we are. Operator : And our next question comes from Erik Bass from Citigroup. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I guess now that the legal entity restructuring is complete, can you just provide an update on the statutory capital levels for the different blocks remaining within Talcott? Christopher John Swift : Erik, what I would say, if you look at our printed results in the supplement for U.S. Life statutory surplus of $7 billion, $1.4 billion of that is HLA. So the remainder $5 billion, $6 billion then would be the 2 Life legal entities that support Talcott. That $5 billion, $6 billion then is before the approximate $275 million loss. So you could think of it on a pro forma basis for that loss, we have $5.3 billion of surplus supporting Talcott runoff and that we have approximately $600 million of that -- on that surplus, that capital is allocated to VA Japan risk that, over time, will -- again an extraordinary dividend and extract, and return to the holding company. So I think, in total, we ought to think about what we have for Talcott runoff is about $4.7 billion of surplus on a pro forma basis, and our Group Benefits company has $1.4 billion of surplus. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And can you talk a little bit about the different options you have for additional deleveraging going forward? I believe you've already committed to retiring the maturities in 2014 and 2015, so would you be looking to potentially tender for additional debt, or do you have any securities that become callable? Christopher John Swift : Yes. I would say, Erik, that our thinking is very early and preliminary, so I wouldn't want to comment beyond that, that we do need to continue to delever. Our goals are geared towards the go-forward businesses and sort of where we need to be to support those businesses going forward and that will continue to require some deleveraging. How we do that, just give us a little bit more time and we'll come back to you. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a couple of quick ones here. The first one, could I get, in the P&C insurance business, what the new money yield is versus the current book yield in the investment portfolio? Do you have that? Christopher John Swift : For the P&C business, I don't have it. I think in total that most of the cash flows relate to the new P&C business, Brian, because we put new money to work at about 3.9% and what was rolling off was about 4%. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, so not much deterioration in that here going forward. Christopher John Swift : Correct. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, great. And then, Andy, just quickly, you gave us what the non-CAT weather was for the home owners. Do you have that number just for the whole consumer unit? And how does that compare to last year's first quarter? Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli: Yes. So all-in personal line, 2.7 points of non-CAT weather, all auto and home combined relative to last year. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Relative to last year. That's the increased relative to last year. Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli: That's the increased relative to last year, yes. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Perfect, that's helpful. And then last one, Doug. I'm just curious, Doug, could you talk about progress being made in the Group Benefits business with respect to voluntary products for the public exchanges that you guys have been working on or just exchanges? Douglas G. Elliot: Absolutely. Good progress to report. We now are out in the market with our critical illness product, feel good about that, and working on that product with several customers as we speak. And I expect as we move toward the latter half of 2014, we'll be also in the market with accident for a 1/1/15 launch as well. So excited that revamped our FLEX disability, out with critical illness and accident to come shortly. Operator : And our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Sabra R. Purtill: Operator? If you can go to the next question and then Jimmy can re-queue if he needs to. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Giovanni from Goldman Sachs. Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess one of the big surprises is also just kind of the pace of buybacks, particularly so far in April. So I wanted to see if you could talk some about how tactical and aggressive you look to be with the current authorization, recognizing you're almost 1/3 of the way through this $2 billion program that doesn't expire until the end of 2015. Liam E. McGee: I'll let Chris give some perspective and then I may answer as well. So Chris, go ahead. Christopher John Swift : Yes. Chris, yes, we're pleased that we're able to do 2 tranches. I think we've said before that we've been operating under a 10b5-1 plan that we put in place for the first and second quarter of late 2013. So we were very opportunistic, our agent was very opportunistic. But our current philosophy really hasn't changed as it relates to the program over the next 6 quarters. We want to be stable, consistent, generally ratable. But we do have opportunities to be opportunistic here in the second quarter remaining in the next 2 months. So generally, we're pleased with what we've done to date and we're going to continue and execute ratably over the next 6 quarters. Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, for Doug, just a question kind of on the broader markets. So you continue to show significant improvement across really all your commercial businesses as you stayed disciplined on the underwriting. The rate of price change seems to be pretty consistent with what we've seen from your peers, but I wanted to see if you could comment on any maybe incremental changes in terms of carriers looking to get either more aggressive around pricing or terms and conditions? Douglas G. Elliot: Chris, I'm not sure I would add any to what I shared to my opening comments. Again, recently balanced marketplace, from own perspective, very much improved profile of our businesses, small and middle, and we talked about Group Benefits as well. Like the product balance in the marketplace, we'd still be driven by our product analytics. And '15 is a long way out, but feel very good about the start of '14, and we'll jump into the second quarter as we ended the first. Operator : And our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just had a more of an overall company enterprise risk management question first, and then a specific question on the statutory. But the -- so Chris, I know you mentioned $1 billion of capital as what's been earmarked from this transaction to be freed up. But also just listening to Liam's comments to open the call about the significant risk reduction, I have to imagine that, from an enterprise risk management standpoint, capital buffers would be significantly reduced as a result of this transaction or the need for capital buffers. So is there any contemplation in terms of how we should consider that and, ultimately, how those capital buffers that exist today may come back to the shareholders? Christopher John Swift : Yes. Tom, it's Chris. I think one point of clarification, what we're saying about the $1 billion, that's the incremental to the capital management plan we announced for '14 and '15. So that is the incremental amount of capital that we will put to work. I think as far as your question regarding capital buffers, capital levels going forward is valid. And we are thinking, really second half of '14 into '15. Now that the legal entity separation work is done, and then I think you know why that was so important to put that out, it put us in a position to run Talcott's 2 remaining legal entities off over a longer period of time with the right targeted runoff capital levels. And we do have the ability to recalibrate that, with Bob Rupp's help, from the risk side. but our guiding principles will always be for Talcott to be self-sufficient in a stress scenario. So with that backdrop, yes, I do think there is some tolerances that we'll look at more closely and change going forward. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a specific question on how we should think about not necessarily dividendable earnings generated from Talcott U.S. going forward, but I'm more interested in capital generation. And I realized there are restrictions to getting money out today because of negative earned surplus. But I assume the outlook on statutory earnings, all things equal, now that you've folded in White River, or that you're in the process of folding it in, probably looks a little more clean and clear. Can you update on what kind of earnings stream on a stat basis you think that entity can produce over the next couple of years? Christopher John Swift : Yes. I think about it just sort of total capital generation no matter if it goes through the P&L or directly to equity. So we still think in terms of -- Talcott has about $300 million to $400 million of annual capital generation. I think we got off to a good start, particularly in '14. So a lot of that was front-ended. But even beyond that, I think it's reasonable to project a steady dividend return from Talcott, that will be our philosophy. And it will be tied to excess capital and generating statutory surplus as these blocks run off. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : As we work through all the shifts in the balance sheet and earnings from the Japan VA sale, I just want to get a sense of whether you feel the 10% corroborating ROE by 2016 would still be reasonable? Christopher John Swift : Jay, it's Chris. How to frame that, I think the way we think about it is that the dilutive impact on core earnings of Japan, we think the go-forward business is their growth with our incremental accretive capital management plans can offset that dilution and gives us a good shot at achieving a 10% ROE in '16. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : That's what I thought. And then for Andy, the personal lines growth is the fastest in many quarters and you are now generating attractive margins from a combined ratio standpoint. I just want to see if there's anything else going on there, sort of underneath the surface, that you feel is driving those better results. Andr\u00e9 A. Napoli: Jay, it's Andy. Thanks for the question. Yes, we feel great about our growth and it's absolutely a reflection of the momentum we created in 2013 across all the channels. So I talked about agency channel ease of doing business, so I won't spend any time on that. But don't underestimate the power that, that can have in that channel for agents and CSRs to place more and more business with us. We've grown our AARP Agency appointments almost 12%. We now have 7,200 agent locations out there that are taking advantage of that terrific program. We've also begun rolling out a new class plan for auto that has the effect of expanding our underwriting sweet spot, if so to speak. We traditionally had a strong focus on more mature, older AARP members, and that very methodical and disciplined expansion of that sweet spot is starting to hit the market. So we've got a lot of things sort of hitting at the same time in the agent channel that are contributing to the growth and then just better execution and marketing in our AARP direct channel and class plan implementation there that also serves to open up our underwriting aperture. Sabra R. Purtill: Lisa, we have time for one more question please. Operator : Our final question comes from Randy Binner from FBR. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : So kind of like an older -- more of a forest rather than all the trees kind of question and it goes back to the Japan VA divestiture here. And so, if I kind of put together the expense saves and the looser capital buffers and the potential for debt paydown and buyback, is that going to -- just from an EPS perspective, not necessarily from an ROE perspective, are all of those initiatives -- can we expect all of those initiatives going forward in our model to kind of make up most of that lost EPS, that's $0.40 or so a year that we lose from the VA earnings in Japan? Should we think about those initiatives as being able to kind of backfill that in our models going forward, or do we kind of lose those EPS the way we seem to be for second quarter here? Christopher John Swift : Randy, 2 points. One, I think implicit in that question, the way we think about it is that net income is going to become more and more important to us as we focus in growing book value per share and ROE. So net income, as you know, over the last couple of years, has been the de minimis or negative sometimes just given the amount of hedging, so I would also have that as a first thought. The second derivative is your core earnings comment then is -- what I was trying to say before is that, yes, I believe that the growth in our go-forward businesses, our efficiency saves, expense saves, the incremental accretive capital management actions, I think we can offset Talcott's Japan's core earnings decline starting in '16. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Okay. And just -- that's very helpful. But when you say starting in '16, I'm sorry, wouldn't it start kicking in before that? Christopher John Swift : Yes. But sort of the crossover point. What I'm saying is that the dilution, the $0.40 that you're talking about, the dilution in earnings, again, I think we could make that up over the next couple of years. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Okay, as we work it through over like the next 18 months is kind of... Christopher John Swift : Yes. Sabra R. Purtill: Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We certainly appreciate your interest in The Hartford. And Shannon and I are available after the call for any follow-up questions you might have. Thanks, and goodbye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Laurel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Sabra Purtill, head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Sabra R. Purtill: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to The Hartford Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. We released these results and also filed the investor financial supplement 10-Q and financial results presentation, which includes our third quarter 2014 outlook, yesterday afternoon. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our speakers for today's call include Liam McGee, Chairman of The Hartford; Chris Swift, CFO; Doug Elliott, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. I would note that other members of our executive leadership team are also available for questions during that section of the call. As described on Page 2 of the financial results presentation, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements, and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are also available on our website. Our presentation today includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the earnings release and financial supplement. I'll now turn the call over to Liam. Liam E. McGee: Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone. It's really good to be with you. You know in my life, I don't have much experience working less than full time. So the last few weeks have been welcome as I've been able to focus on my health. And I do appreciate the many expressions that I received from so many of you. And I'm very pleased to report that I'm feeling much better and stronger. I have also had time to reflect on The Hartford's remarkable turnaround and transformation. The Hartford faced severe challenges when I arrived in 2009, and its future was unclear. Today, with a focus on growing profitable businesses, the company's prospects are bright. Now as you know, while we made many changes over the last 5 years, I believe 3 were critical to our success. And we'll continue to deliver shareholder value. We brought clarity to the company's strategic direction, focusing on businesses where we could compete and win. We have invested and we'll continue to invest in new capabilities for those businesses. The result has been sustained margin expansion, with more expected. We significantly lowered the risk profile of the company to a more reasonable level, most importantly recently, with the sale of Japan. This will reduce the volatility of The Hartford's results and will lower our cost of capital going forward. Finally, we focused on generating and freeing up capital. We retained businesses that could create capital and sold other businesses that were capital-consumptive. We also reduced the size and risk of the Talcott Resolution liability, freeing more capital in the process. As a result, The Hartford now has a very strong balance sheet, with the capital flexibility to take accretive actions to create shareholder value. These 3 steps : reducing risk, narrowing the strategic focus and generating capital, were key to the transformation and position us well for the future. The CEO transition from me to Chris has gone smoothly. Over the last few years, I spent a great deal of time on talent development and succession planning with the Board of Directors, and this thoughtful preparation enabled the board to act quickly and decisively when I decided to step aside as CEO. And I must emphasize that I couldn't be more confident in The Hartford's future with Chris Swift as CEO, Doug Elliot as President, and Beth Bombara as Chief Financial Officer, as well as the entire executive leadership team. Personally, I have fully transitioned to my new role as Executive Chairman and I look forward to supporting this team. Finally, I want to thank you, our investors and analysts. I have valued your support and insight, but if I could be candid, some days more than others, and in the early days of my tenure, your patience with this banker, who as I was reminded was relatively new in the industry. I appreciate your support. I particularly want to thank The Hartford's employees of whom this management team has asked a lot, and they have consistently delivered with great pride and integrity. Without a doubt, the nearly 18,000 teammates are The Hartford's greatest strength. With that, I'm proud to turn the call over to the Chief Executive Officer of The Hartford, Chris Swift. Chris? Christopher John Swift : Thank you, Liam, for your comments. On behalf of the board, the management team and 18,000 Hartford teammates, I want to thank you for all that you've done for our company. Your willingness to make tough decisions, along with your guidance, leadership and passion, drove the successful transformation of The Hartford. You have positioned the company for great success and the leadership team and I are committed to achieving our vision of an exceptional Hartford. Personally, I am deeply appreciative of our partnership over the last 5 years. Thank you, Liam. I'm honored to serve as CEO of this great company, and I am excited about the path we are on. We continue to execute the company strategy, profitably growing the P&C, Group Benefits, the Mutual Fund businesses, reducing the size and risk of the legacy annuity blocks, and transforming The Hartford into a more effective and efficient organization. We have made tremendous progress. Profit margins are expanding in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. All the businesses are growing the top line, with the exception of Group Benefits, where margins have recovered strongly and the top line has stabilized. Although prior year A&E development and elevated storm activity impacted The Hartford's second quarter results, the underlying trends in this quarter reflect a positive momentum in the businesses. In the P&C lines, written premiums grew 3%, and the ex-CAT ex-prior year combined ratio improved 0.9 points from the second quarter of 2013. Written premiums in Small Commercial were up 6%, and the underlying combined ratio was 85.4%, an improvement of 2.2 points compared to the second quarter of 2013. Core earnings in Group Benefits and Mutual Funds increased over the prior year quarters. I am confident we will continue to expand margins. Our pricing levels are higher than our loss cost trends in the P&C and benefits businesses. In Middle Market, new property and general liability capabilities are driving profitable growth in selected markets, a dramatic improvement over the past 2 years. In Group Benefits, earnings have sharply rebounded, and we expect the business to produce a sustainable after-tax core margin of around 5.5%. We are rolling out new voluntary offerings, and I expect to see top line growth beginning next year. The Talcott Resolution team has meaningfully reduced the size and risk of the annuity liabilities in the U.S., and of course, in Japan. For the U.S. blocks, we will continue to use targeted initiatives to accelerate the annuity runoff. As we said before, we will consider transactions as a potential tool, but I expect that we will create the most value for shareholders if we manage the runoff of the U.S. block ourselves. With a more focused company, we must operate more effectively and efficiently, while investing in new capabilities. We have done well in our cost neutrality efforts, having eliminated the stranded cost from the Life and Retirement Plans businesses, and we will continue to manage expenses as Talcott shrinks. We also will continue to invest to increase our competitiveness in key markets and improve the quality of our customer experiences. I am confident in The Hartford strategy. I'm also very confident in this management team. With the changes announced Tuesday, the team possesses an outstanding mix of experience and skills, perfectly suited to The Hartford. Doug Elliot has demonstrated he is one of the best P&C operators in the business. As president, his new responsibilities now include all of P&C and Group Benefits, including claims, providing greater accountability and alignment across these businesses. Beth Bombara has been an outstanding leader in both finance and operating roles at The Hartford, most recently in Talcott Resolution. Beth's financial skills and business expertise will be critical factors in this team's success. Bill Bloom is a great addition for The Hartford. He has deep technology and customer service operations experience, but equally important, he knows the insurance business. I'm also excited to have Ray Sprague join my leadership team as leader of Strategy and Business Development. Ray is a seasoned P&C industry veteran, who has done a terrific job in building our industry-leading Small Commercial business. Ray will work closely with me and other senior leaders to accelerate the pace of growth across the enterprise. In addition, Ray will serve as acting head of Consumer Markets to replace Andy Napoli. We appreciate Andy's contributions to the company over the past few years and we wish him great success in his next opportunity. Finally, I'm pleased that Brion Johnson will lead Talcott Resolution in addition to continuing as the Chief Investment Officer. Brion has annuity experience in his background and he's the ideal leader for Talcott, as it continues to reduce the size and risk of the U.S. annuity liabilities. Every member of the team understands the insurance business model, a trust-based business where confidence is earned one day at a time with customers and partners. When that confidence and trust accumulates over time, it develops into a powerful brand and a market leader. This team is determined to win and build an exceptional company. On July 1, we announced the closing of the sale of the Japan annuity business. We went from signing to closing in 60 days, an outstanding accomplishment. Both parties worked diligently to get this done, and I appreciate everyone's effort. The Japan sale is an important milestone. It accelerates the strategic transformation of The Hartford and significantly improves the company's risk profile. The sale also enables us to increase the company's capital management plan for 2014 and 2015 by $1.275 billion. Consistent with our prior programs, the expansion will be balanced between equity and debt repurchase, in this case, about 60% equity and 40% debt. We plan to put most of that additional capital to work by the end of this year. In addition, we have increased the common stock dividend by 20% to $0.18 per quarter, based on the improving earnings power of the P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses. With the expansion of the capital plan, the total share repurchase and debt repayment for 2014 and 2015 is nearly $4 billion. Over time, the generation of excess capital from profitable growth in the businesses and the runoff of U.S. annuity block and the use of that capital in accretive ways, will be critical to driving ROE improvement and increasing book value per share. In closing, I am thrilled to take on this new role. I am very confident in the future of this company. The ingredients for success are here. And I am proud of all that this team has accomplished, and we are relentlessly executing on The Hartford's strategic plan with a focus on creating shareholder value. Now I will turn the call over to The Hartford's President, Doug Elliot. Doug? Douglas G. Elliot: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financial results for Commercial and Consumer markets, a few comments on our new team. I'm excited about working more closely with our Consumer Markets group. We have an excellent team and a terrific brand in the consumer space and I'm looking forward to being their partner. I'm also excited about Bill Bloom joining our team. Bill and I have worked together in the past. The leadership and expertise he brings to our organization will be invaluable for our journey ahead, and an excellent fit with the strong technology and operations team that we already have in place. Likewise, I'm very pleased about Ray Sprague's broadened responsibilities across the enterprise. He's a proven leader with deep insurance experience that we will leverage to further expand our franchise. And lastly, we are very fortunate to have Stephanie Bush ready to step into the role as head of Small Commercial. Stephanie has a long and successful track record in P&C Commercial here at The Hartford, and has ideally prepared to take this business to new levels of growth and performance. Now let me get into our results. I'll cover P&C Commercial first, move on to consumer, and conclude with Group Benefit. We had a very solid second quarter in P&C Commercial. Across our business units, we posted quality earnings and delivered strong top line results, even as the market shows signs of growing competitive pressure. Overall, I remained pleased with our execution and confident in our ability to navigate changing market conditions. For the quarter, we delivered core earnings of $213 million on an all-in combined ratio of 94.2. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, this is an increase of $15 million in core earnings, and an improvement of 4.2 points on the combined ratio. Underwriting gains were up $66 million in the quarter versus last year, offset by a decrease in net investment income. Current accident year CATs were relatively modest for the second quarter of 2014 and $9 million less than the quarter 1 year ago. The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior development was 91.1 for the second quarter of 2014, an improvement of 2 points versus prior year, reflecting our strong execution across all business units. Turning to the top line, our total written premium was up 2%. Excluding the decline in our programs business of $28 million, which is a result of our re-underwriting actions, P&C Commercial grew 5% for the second quarter. We also continued to drive written pricing gains, achieving a 6% increase for Standard Commercial. We are watching our pricing trends very closely, given growing competitive pressure and diligently executing our pricing segmentation methodologies. Importantly, pricing continued to outpace loss cost trends. Let me now drill down in each of our P&C Commercial businesses. We had another excellent quarter in Small Commercial, with an all-in combined ratio of 89.3. Last quarter, I noted that our top line momentum was building. Those trends continued this quarter, with policy retention improving to 84% and new business of $140 million for the quarter, up 12% over prior year. Equally impressive, our underlying combined ratio of 85.4 improved 2.2 points versus second quarter 2013. Our Small Commercial team is driving top line, written pricing gains and superior underwriting results. We could not be more pleased with our path forward. Moving to Middle Market. I continue to be encouraged by our steady progress here, posting an underlying combined ratio of 95.1. Although this is essentially flat versus prior year, we are executing well in critical priorities. Renewal written pricing at 6% remained ahead of loss cost trends, and our underlying combined ratio in Middle Market worker's compensation is down nearly 5 points for the quarter versus last year. Offsetting these results was an increase in our property losses. We see nothing specific beyond these losses other than the normal volatility associated with the property line. Over the last several years, our team has done a great job of balancing our worker's compensation book with more writings in property and general liability. In fact, we're very excited to have just locked in a new property per risk reinsurance treaty that provides CAT capacity up to $500 million. This is a very important line of business in our strategy, and we expect to thoughtfully continue our property expansion. Commercial auto has been a more challenging line across the industry, including us as well. Our Middle Market written pricing in this line is in the high single-digits, as we continue to address loss cost trends. Our retentions have remained quite strong, despite the rate increases, indicating to us that the overall market is also raising rates. Middle Market premium was up 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by improved retention. New business of $112 million was down slightly from last year, with a well-balanced product mix. Pricing and underwriting actions remained disciplined and the rate adequacy of our Middle Market book is significantly improved from prior years. Turning to Specialty Commercial. National accounts delivered another strong quarter of written premium growth, up 7% versus last year. We continue to believe that available new business in the market is down slightly from 2013, but we're still seeing opportunities to write new accounts. Our retention rates continue to exceed 90%. The repositioning of our programs business remains on track as is progress in our Financial Products business as well. Shifting over to consumer. We experienced elevated property losses in the second quarter, posting an all-in combined ratio of 106.3. Excluding CATs in prior year development, the underlying combined ratio was 89.6, up 0.7 points from a year ago. Like others in the industry, weather adversely affected both auto and homeowners results on a CAT and ex-CAT basis. The largest CAT event in the quarter was a string of May hailstorms that crossed 11 states from Montana to South Carolina, accounting for nearly 1/3 of our CAT losses. Outside of CATs and weather, we experienced higher fire losses in the quarter versus last year, contributing 4 points to the underlying homeowners combined ratio. At this point, we don't see an unusual pattern developing with respect to fire losses, other than the usual volatility associated with this peril. Top line momentum continued with 4% written premium growth, driven in part by auto new business production, particularly strong in both agency channels. Premium retention was flat for auto and homeowners and a solid result given continued written pricing gains of 5 and 8 points, respectively. Perhaps most noteworthy was our auto PIF growth of 1% in the quarter, a direct result of more precise pricing segmentation and service delivery improvements. Our expense ratio decreased this quarter to 23.2. This is due to the timing of technology and marketing spend, which is weighted more to the back half of the year. We expect our full year expense ratio to be comparable to the 23.8 we reported in the first quarter. Now let's move to Group Benefits. This was another strong quarter for Group Benefits with core earnings of $52 million, up 41% from last year. Profit improvement this quarter is driven largely by the life and AD&D lines, where we benefited from favorable life mortality. Disability trends were slightly elevated in the quarter yet remain favorable year-to-date through June. For the quarter, long-term disability incident trends continue to be favorable, offset by lower recoveries versus a year ago, resulting in a slightly higher disability loss ratio. We continue to see favorable effects of our underwriting, pricing and claims management initiatives reflected in the achieved margin improvement across our employer group life and disability block. The rate of improvement has been significant in recent years, and we will remain disciplined with these operating leverage. Looking at the top line. Fully insured ongoing premium declined 7% compared to prior year. As we've noted previously, the decrease is primarily attributed to our exit of an agreement with a third-party targeting sales through financial institutions. Excluding the premium from this arrangement, our top line is down about 1% to prior year. Overall book persistency on our group life and disability business exceeded 90% through June, which is up over 10 points from 2013. We are very pleased with our renewal block and the overall persistency rebound versus 2012 and 2013. Industry data indicates that new sales are trending down slightly. Our sense is that in early 2014, large case customers have taken a tempered approach to moving their business, particularly as they sort through the dynamics of the Affordable Care Act and the trend to our more employee-direct benefit options. We believe this may have been a factor in our own strong book persistency, and contributed to our lower quarter-over-quarter fully insured ongoing sales of $45 million. We continue to actively quote business and we believe that we're competing effectively for new accounts, leveraging our expanding service and claim capabilities. In closing, this is a solid quarter for us across P&C and Group Benefits. While P&C Commercial competition continues to grow, I would still characterize the environment as rational. Our aggressive and disciplined actions in Standard Commercial over the last 3 years have us in strong position to compete moving forward. And we continue to make the people and technology investments that will be necessary to succeed in the years ahead. Now let me turn the call over to Beth Bombara. Beth A. Bombara: Thank you, Doug. Last evening, we reported second quarter core earnings of $144 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Second quarter results included $178 million after tax or $0.38 per diluted share of unfavorable items. The largest item was $164 million after tax of A&E unfavorable prior year development, consisting of $146 million for the annual asbestos reserve study and $18 million for environmental. Aside from these 2 annual studies, unfavorable prior year development was not material, totaling $10 million before tax, of which $7 million was for accretion of discount on worker's compensation reserves. During the quarter, current year catastrophes totaled $127 million after tax, slightly above our outlook. There were 13 named catastrophes with winds and hail being the highest cost perils this quarter. The net loss for the quarter was $467 million or $1 per diluted share compared with the net loss of $190 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2013. The largest contributor to the net loss for the quarter was the loss in discontinued operations due to the Japan annuity sale, which totaled $617 million after tax. P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds generated core earnings of $113 million, down from $197 million in second quarter 2013, primarily due to the A&E prior year development. As you know, we complete the annual asbestos and environmental studies in the second quarter. Environmental reserve development totaled $27 million before tax in part due to increased cleanup cost on a few water waste sites. The $212 million before tax increase in the asbestos reserve primarily arises from a small number of insured. For those insured, a higher-than-expected frequency and severity of mesothelioma claims drove the reserve increase. We continue to proactively pursue legislative and legal remedies to manage these claim cost, including transparency around the various asbestos bankruptcy trusts. Mutual Funds core earnings rose 5% over the prior year, due to higher fees resulting from increased assets under management. Performance remains solid with 76% of funds outperforming their peers over the last 5 years. We continued to see sales momentum, up 5% in total, and up 38% of our equity funds, while redemptions also declined. However, net flows were slightly negative due to our previously announced decision to liquidate target date funds, which had $709 million in assets under management. Excluding that liquidation, net flows were positive by about $300 million. Talcott's core earnings for the quarter were $101 million, which was above our outlook, principally due to higher investment income, including limited partnerships. The risk of our U.S. VA book continued to decline. With U.S. equity markets up 5% in the quarter, 95% of the GMWB contracts are out of the money. We continue to pursue various policyholder programs to reduce the size and risk of the Talcott books of business. In addition to the ISV program for U.S. retail fixed annuities that was launched in the first quarter, during the second quarter, we rolled out a second Enhanced Surrender Value program for certain of our lifetime benefit contracts. With the impact of these programs and surrender activity, fixed annuity accounts decreased by 7% and variable annuity contracts decreased by 3% during the quarter. Turning to investment income. The general account is producing solid investment returns with modest impairment. We have a highly diversified portfolio with investments in a broad array of asset classes. Our overall credit risk profile is not materially different from a year ago. Yields have held up relatively well despite the low interest rate environment, without increasing credit risk or portfolio duration. The decline in total investment income from the prior year quarter was principally due to lower assets as a result of the runoff of Talcott and lower limited partnership income. Excluding limited partnership return, the annualized portfolio yield in the quarter was 4.1%, down approximately 10 basis points from a year ago. Low interest rates and tight credit spreads remain a challenge. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance returns by leveraging our investment capabilities without compromising portfolio quality. For instance, in the second quarter, we achieved a reinvestment rate of 3.8%, aided by attractive opportunities in private placement securities and commercial mortgage loans, where we could maintain credit quality in yield by capturing liquidity premium. The Hartford's book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at June 30, 2014, was $39.21, down slightly from year end, but up 2% from June 30, 2013. The growth in book value per share over the last year was due to the positive impact of net income and share repurchases over the last 12 months, which were partially offset by shareholder dividends. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.2 million common shares for $351 million at an average price of $34.53 per share. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2014, our core earnings ROE was 7.8% compared with 6.1% at June 30, 2013. I would like to point out that core earnings ROEs for all periods presented have been recast to reflect Japan earnings as a discontinued operation, which has the effect of reducing our core earnings ROEs. Looking forward, we would expect our full year 2015 core ROE to improve to the low 9% level, after giving effect to the full execution of our capital management plans, as well as continued profitable growth in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. On July 1, we announced the closing of the sale of the Japan annuity business for cash proceeds of $963 million. As a result of the additional financial flexibility and risk reduction provided by this sale, our capital management plan for 2014 and 2015 has been increased by $1.275 billion to a total of almost $4 billion. And in addition, we increased our common dividend by 20%. The combination of the capital benefit from the sale, improved cash flow generation from Talcott, and strong earnings power from P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, enables us to execute this plan and will contribute to future ROE improvement. The $1.275 billion increase is comprised of 2 pieces. First, a $775 million increase in equity repurchases, including a $525 million accelerated share repurchase plan or ASR, that was executed yesterday and will be completed by year end. Second, we allocated $500 million for additional debt reduction, including associated premiums and transaction expenses, which also will be completed this year. With the expansion of the share repurchase plan, beyond the portion being used for the ASR, we expect that equity repurchases will be about $300 million a quarter. Actual repurchases will, of course, depend on market conditions and other factors that may impact market access and timing. In the third quarter through July 29, we have purchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $140 million. Yesterday, we also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share, up 20% from the $0.15 that we began paying in mid-2013, and the third increase in 3 years. Before turning to your questions, let me provide a brief summary of our third quarter outlook. Our core earnings outlook for the third quarter of 2014 is $335 million to $355 million or $0.74 to $0.79 per diluted share, assuming $452 million shares outstanding. Talcott earnings are projected at $75 million to $85 million. This outlook assumes catastrophe losses of $87 million after tax, which is equivalent to about 5.2 points on a combined ratio. This outlook is about a 15% increase in core earnings per share after adjusting third quarter 2013 for items that included a favorable $55 million corporate settlement, cash below budget and prior year development. To wrap up, the second quarter was another quarter of significant progress. Despite challenging catastrophe and non-CAT weather conditions, underlying performance in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds continued to improve, and Talcott made a significant leap forward in reducing the size and risk of its portfolio with the sale of Japan. We remain focused on achieving greater operating efficiency and effectiveness. And the combination with these accomplishments and our expanded capital management plans, we are on the right path to achieving book value growth and higher core earnings ROEs, which will continue to create shareholder value. And we'll now turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session. Sabra R. Purtill: Thank you, Beth. Laurel, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : A couple of questions, maybe first, a big picture question for Chris. As you look out a couple of years, Chris, is there some ROE range that you think the company can achieve if you're looking out to '16 or '17? Christopher John Swift : Jay, I think Beth tried to describe what we see in the near term through '15 with our announced capital management plans and where we see the momentum of the go-forward business is. When you get in the '16, '17, we previously -- continue to believe we can expand ROE in those years as we continue to grow and manage capital accretively, but probably not at the rate of pace that we see through -- now through the end of '15. So we still believe we're in that 30 to 40, 50-basis-point continual improvement through those years at this point in time. But as you know, when you get further out, Jay, a lot of dynamics in the economics of the P&C cycle and the businesses, but we're still confident that we're going to be able to expand beyond where we see 2015 currently. Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. That's helpful, Chris. And second question, maybe for Doug. In the Consumer Markets business, you highlight a certain elevated level of non-CAT weather and fire losses. I'm wondering if you can discuss those losses relative to a normal quarter? How much above typical were those losses? Douglas G. Elliot: Jay, it's Doug. Couple of thoughts, you have our detail inside the supplementals. You know that our core accident year, essentially quarter-over-quarter was up 2 points. And that was due to non-CAT, both weather and fire. I would also describe that 2-point change as roughly above normal as well. So I think I would use a couple of points as the answer on both accounts. Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess I was talking just about the Consumer business. Did I say Commercial? I meant Consumer, if I... Douglas G. Elliot: Did I say Commercial? I was talking Consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW. Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : To start, asbestos is something that we generally can sometimes look through, and so I don't want to get too hung up on it. But we've seen a number of asbestos retro deals, particularly with births [ph] around industry. And I'm just curious if this is something that you'd consider doing and then along with that, how dilutive something like that might actually be relative to the downside on policy limits, sort of as a worst case scenario? Christopher John Swift : Vincent, I think we're very aware of the third-party solutions that are out there and available in the marketplace. And with that said, where we are today is we haven't found anything that we think is economical for us at this point, and believe really managing these liabilities off ourselves is the optimum strategy. I think also you need to consider that these are really complex claim matters and again, we feel best suited with the expertise that we've built longer -- in a long period of time with John Kinney and his outstanding claims team. And it's really in our best interest to manage our own claims also during this period of time. So you put the economics, you put our claim handling and expertise available, and that's where our current thinking is. Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay, good. And then just for a quick follow-up. On the product development side, and with a lot of the defensive work here being a complete to many of Liam's earlier points. I get the sense that there's been an incremental step-up, sort of if we can call it your offense strategy here in 2014. I was hoping to maybe get a preview of any of the new products or distribution opportunities that you might have here on the radar with the new leadership structure. Christopher John Swift : Vincent, I'll just give you a perspective and I know Doug will want to share his view. So I think you're specifically referring to Ray Sprague joining my leadership team as the head of Strategy and Business Development. And he's got a broad mandate, and the broad mandate is obviously to accelerate our growth and our capabilities and Doug and I, when we talk, and we talk in terms of product, we talk in terms of distribution, we talk in terms of geographic presence. So Ray's got a great track record in being very innovative, creative in the Small Commercial area. So Doug and I want to leverage that capabilities across a broader platform. Doug, what color would you... Douglas G. Elliot: Maybe a few more ideas Vincent on top of Chris that I will share with you. In the second quarter, we did announce a new partnership with AARP in the Small Commercial space, so that will be a growing opportunity we look after and work at. Secondly, as we've commented previously, we have a number of initiatives in our Group Benefits space. We rolled out a critical illness product in the second quarter and still working on other products as we move through '14 and to '15. And lastly, and I know we've shared quite a bit of this with you, our journey to round out our Middle Market workers comp book continues. We feel very good about progress in the property and general liability area. But as noted now, new upside structure relative to reinsurance capacity and property, I think allows us to continue to expand. So a lot of work in the product development area across all these businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : It's a question for Doug. In commercial lines, as you highlighted, you continue to get rate above your loss cost trends. Just based on what you're seeing in both the industry pricing trend, as well as Hartford's specific dynamics, how much longer do you think that this can continue? Maybe what are you doing that's enabling you to outperform the industry? Douglas G. Elliot: Erik, maybe few thoughts for you. First thing I would say is, as we look out 90-plus days. We don't see something dramatic occurring that will have a dramatic shift or impact on the trend line. So I could be wrong, but as I think out and I look at what we're trying to accomplish third quarter beyond, our behavior's going to be very consistent. That's our attempt. Secondly, I'll remind you and others that as we think about margin improvement, and we're constantly thinking about that, there are other levers that we're constantly working. So we're working underwriting, nonrenewal renewal strategies, we have a number of initiatives in our claims area. And so we're working on a number of areas, not just pricing against loss trend, and we feel good about what we've accomplished to date. I know that I've referenced our work in the auto area, it's not a line where we're pleased with the overall performance today. It is getting additional attention. I talked to you about our rate gains in the second quarter. Those gains will continue. That's our intent into quarters 3 and 4 and beyond. So a lot of work going on, and I'm bullish that what we've accomplished so far will be the beginning of a really good path forward. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : If I can ask quickly on Group Benefits, where do you think the margins can get to over time? And is it achievable to get back to kind of the 7% range where you were in 2007, 2008? Christopher John Swift : Erik, it's Chris. In my prepared remarks, we talked in terms of 5.5 on a sustainable basis. So I would temper your expectations a little bit on 7%. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. And what does that translate into an ROE? Christopher John Swift : I would say again, with the statutory capital and the GAAP capital that we hold against that businesses, we think we could operate in the low double-digits and try to grow it from there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Chris, with regard to the -- or Beth, with regard to the ROE outlook, I'm thinking that since the life business has the greater portion of the common equity of The Hartford ex AOCI than P&C, but P&C delivers the lion's share of the earnings that it might make sense to explore every avenue to continue to shrink that, the runoff life business, including the U.S. variable annuity. I know you mentioned, you prefer to keep that in-house, but perhaps you could expand your thoughts on that. Christopher John Swift : Jay, it's Chris. Let me just take the strategy point and then Beth will talk about the ROE implications and the allocation of capital. I think if you think about it, where we're at right now, now that we've sold Japan, we're really left just with a U.S. platform. You've always heard us talk about that we think that risk is -- we understand it very well. It's been managed historically very well. We know how to hedge it. We make about $300 million a year on that VA line of business. Our hedge costs are low, obviously, at these new market levels, including our macro program. So that we really are positioning Talcott as a steady capital provider to the holding company in years to come. And then we'd like to use that capital again to redeploy into higher accretive purposes. So that's sort of a simple model. But I always did say we're always aware of, I'll call it, options out there as a potential tool. But what we see right now for the next -- a couple of years at least, is what we'd like. So Beth, would you share your comment? Beth A. Bombara: Thank you, Chris. And I'll echo a lot of Chris's comments on that, as we sit here day and look at not only just the GAAP earnings generation that comes from the Talcott businesses, but with the elimination of Japan and the reduced volatility from our statutory results, we really do see ourselves on a path of being able to rely more consistently on taking dividends out of the life entities. And all of that obviously, over time, will play into the ROE equation. And it is a balancing act between increasing that ROE, maybe initially and long term, what we think the economics are of this business and provides us with greater, I think, capital flexibility for the long term. But at Chris said, we're always mindful that there are other opportunities to accelerate that, but that's kind of the equation that we go back and forth in our minds with. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : That's helpful. And then for the low-9% return equity outlook for 2015, does that assume continued underlying margin expansion in the Property & Casualty business? Beth A. Bombara: Yes, that includes our thoughts going into '15 of the margin expansion that we see in our businesses, as well as the full execution of the current capital management plan that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : I want to go back to asbestos, I'm afraid. I know that there's been issues across the industry, but it's still -- it's a lot of money to lose there opposed to -- for what's supposed to be a decaying liability. And I guess, I want to get a better sense you can provide us with what's going on? I get that it's peripheral defendants by mostly mesothelioma claims, but are you losing at trial? Are you settling more? Are you just spending more on claims and defense costs? I'd like to kind of understand better what's going on. And with a hope to kind of get a sense, objectively, at least, of when we think this might trail off. Christopher John Swift : Randy, it's Chris. Beth's prepared to give you more insights. But just from my chair and observing this over a little bit of time, you're not going to like this, but there's really nothing new here. I mean, this is still a handful of our accounts. There's nothing new that's sort of bubbling up. When you have, I'll call it, sort of elevated frequency in our accounts and you extend that out over a longer period of time when our model predicts, you can have a relatively large movement in our loss reserves. But Beth will give you a little bit more of the details on what's going on. But the key point here is there's nothing new that we're managing or that we're getting exposed to. It's more of the same. Beth A. Bombara: Yes, Chris, I would agree with that. And again as we said, if you think about the charge that we took, the $212 million pretax, think about roughly 2/3 of that coming from the experience that we're seeing with a small number and you said all the right words, peripheral insureds, where we're seeing an increase in meso claims. And we would have expected to see a decrease. And given the severity that comes with meso claims, and we extrapolate that out through our models, we get the increase that you saw -- that we recorded this quarter. The medical science continues to point to the fact that we should start to see a decrease in these claims. And depending on what activity affects our insureds and the type of coverage that we provided to those specific insureds that see these increases, this is the result that we see. But as Chris said, it's not really anything new. It's just how that activity is affecting our insureds and how it runs through our models where we extrapolate over many, many years. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : No, that's helpful. So I mean these are legitimate meso claims. These is not the -- the expansion of liability is more to the peripheral of the defendants but the actual claim is legit, and so you're just having to post more to settle more, basically. Beth A. Bombara: Yes, exactly. This is not like what we saw years and years ago, whereas people who were claiming that they were affected but they had no manifestation of an actual disease. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : A couple of quick questions on the quarter. Doug, you mentioned, I believe in your prepared remarks an expectation for the Consumer Markets expense ratio for the remainder of this year. I was wondering if you could give us any help on your expectations on the Commercial side for the expense ratio as well. Douglas G. Elliot: John, let me frame that. There aren't any variations that I think affect your model. And Chris, I can't think of anything relative to run rate that are either front loaded, back loaded, or has some seasonality to it. So John, I think what you've seen is a good indication of where we are, and I think you can move forward from there. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay, very helpful. Then on the new Enhanced Surrender program, can you just give us a little bit of color on what you're expecting there? How much account value or number of contracts you're targeting? Should we think about the cost benefit analysis there as being pretty similar to the most recent surrender program on the VA side? Beth A. Bombara: Yes, sure, this is Beth, I'll take that. So again, there's 2 programs. There is, we refer to as the ISV, which is focused on a fixed annuity block, and it's about 4 billion to 5 billion of account value that we are making this offer to. And our expectations on that is that we would see about a 15% take rate. On the ESV program, it's similar to the program that we did last year with some modifications. And again, it is targeted at our variable annuity book and a specific tranche of about $6 billion of account value. And we're assuming there that we'll probably see about a 15% take rate as well. That's down from what we saw with our first program. But we think given the fact that this program -- the offers are a little bit less than before, and we've also been out to this group of policyholders with our first offer so we expect the rate to be a little bit less. And when we put the combination of both programs together and at those take rates, we'd expect to see about $150 million-ish of capital benefit when we look at sort of our stress scenario capital. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : And that $150 million is both of them put together? Beth A. Bombara: Both of them put together, yes. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it, okay. And then just one final quick question. So I think you ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion of cash and short-term securities at the parent. Can you just sort of roll us forward, because here in a few days, or maybe in the month of July, a lot of things happened, right? You brought in the cash proceeds from the Japan annuity sale, you've done a decent amount of buybacks, including the ASR. So on a pro forma basis at the end of July, would it be correct to just sort of take those couple of things into account and roll it forward, or is there anything else more significant? Beth A. Bombara: That would be the most significant item. The only other item that we did, and it's really a timing item more than anything else, is we did accelerate some of the dividends that we'd normally take out of the P&C legal entities. So if you read our Q, you'll see that in there. And that was about $500 million or so. And that really was just an acceleration of what we normally would have done over the third, fourth and first quarter on the remaining of this year and into next year. It's not an indication that overall, we plan to be taking more of the P&C company going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just wanted to focus on what you've announced for the capital, planned the update in the capital plan. Now that Japan is behind you, should we expect that there's going to be another phase of capital return for 2015 related to risk buffer and U.S. Talcott? And if so, when do you think we'd get an update on that? Or finally, is that more -- it's something that we should be thinking about more for 2016 and not 2015? Christopher John Swift : It's Chris. Beth will provide some commentary too. So I think you might know this, right? We just announced what we want to do for the rest of '15. So we're going to start getting after that. I think the accelerated plan demonstrates our commitment to really deploy our excess capital in what we think is the most accretive ways. And we'll look -- we're always going to continue to look at the balance sheet, all the combinations of factors in our operating companies, our holding companies, and always challenge ourselves to being as efficient as possible with our capital. So Beth, would you provide any additional color? Beth A. Bombara: Yes, and I think Chris, that summarizes it very well. Again, when you look at the plan that we have announced, a significant amount of both equity repurchases and debt repayments that we'll be dealing for the remainder of '14 and going into '15. And I think we've demonstrated that as we look at our overall capital position and look to manage our Talcott entities at appropriate levels, that to the extent that we were to make any changes of that in the future, we obviously would share that with you. But I would not be expecting some sort of big change coming in the short term as it relates to our capital management plan. But I think more importantly, if I just could add, what we really are focused on is looking at what the statutory capital generation is in the Talcott entities and getting ourselves in a place where we can rely on a predictable stream of cash flows coming out of those entities over time. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And just -- Beth, just a follow-up on that. Does the plan that you just announced contemplate utilizing U.S. Talcott dividends? Beth A. Bombara: So our current plan does anticipate, kind of consistent with where we've talked about before, $250 million, $300 million of dividend, so that is contemplated in the current plan and to some extent, a portion of that was contemplated in the previous plans. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : You said $250 million to $300 million? Beth A. Bombara: Yes. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And just the last question. The $500 million additional debt reduction, can you just bring us up to speed in terms of how far out does that get you? And how should we be thinking about what maturities that takes care of? I believe that actually gets you through more than 2016 maturities, if I'm doing the math correctly, and it would get you out until 2017. Or am I not thinking about that correctly? Is there -- are you more thinking about doing early retirement of some of these maturities? Beth A. Bombara: Yes, so a couple of things. So first of all, with the plan that we had announced earlier this year, as you may recall, we had indicated that we were targeting 2 of the maturities that we have in 2015, which is about $456 million. And so those will come to the normal course. The $500 million that we've allocated for debt repayment for the remainder of this year, we don't have another maturity that would happen in the third or fourth quarter of '14. So we will be looking at either calling a tranche of debt or a tender. But that would be an acceleration. We don't have a maturity that lines up with that. Sabra R. Purtill: Laurel, we have time for one more question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Two quick questions here. First one, Doug, you mentioned elevated property losses in the Middle Market commercial lines space. What would that add to the underlying combined ratio in the quarter, kind of relative with what's normalized? Douglas G. Elliot: So we share the underlying and the Middle Market overall combined ratio side. I'd point you there in our supplement. I would characterize the losses as primarily fire, a couple of larger losses in our property book and we also have one in our inland marine book. So somewhat outsized but not -- we don't take enormous retentions. Our retentions are normally under $10 million and so they did cause a little bit of blip in our Middle category. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Can you quantify what the kind of -- was it 1 point, 2 points in the underlying? Douglas G. Elliot: There's so much seasonality. I will give you a sense. Our core, as I think about second quarter, non-weather losses over the last 3 or 4 years were higher than the norm by a couple of points overall. So it's not -- certainly not 10 points in the book, right? It's 2 to 3 points. They're having quarters that have had that kind of activity. But relative to 2013, we're a little outsized. Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Next question for you Doug. Just curious, now that you're going be running the Consumer business, any changes that you anticipate making and specifically focused on your other agency business that continues to kind of contract here? Douglas G. Elliot: So this is 2 days in. No changes planned. We have a terrific franchise with AARP and obviously, you know that I've been deep in the agency space on the Commercial side for the last 25 years. So excited about what we will be doing there, what we're doing there currently today. Just a lot of work in front of me and looking forward with Ray to working with his team. So more to come as we talk forward. Sabra R. Purtill: Thank you, Brian. We'd like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford. If anyone has any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact either Sean or myself by phone or e-mail. Thank you, and have a good afternoon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Christopher J. Swift: Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Yesterday afternoon The Hartford reported outstanding third quarter results. Core earnings were $477 million or $1.06 per diluted share, up 25% year-over-year on a per share basis. We delivered earnings growth in every business, and saw the benefits of the capital management program. Catastrophe losses and limited partnership returns were both favorable in the quarter. The third quarter results reflect the progress we are making across the company. Profit margins expanded in every business. In total P&C, the combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development improved 2.6 points to 90.2 reflecting our sustained focus on pricing improvements. We are also growing the top line in P&C. In small commercial written premiums were up 7%, fueled by positive pricing and new business premium growth. In both consumer markets and middle market the top line was up 3%, reflecting pricing and disciplined underwriting. Doug and Beth will provide additional detail in insights about the quarter. When I reflect on the numbers, the most important takeaway for me is that the results demonstrate that the Hartford is on the right track. Investments we have made to drive profitable growth have taken hold and we are starting to see the positive results. Looking ahead, our primary objectives are improving return on equity and growing book value per share to drive top-quartile shareholder returns. To do this, you can expect to see continued progress in four major areas. First, expanding product in underwriting capabilities; second, increasing distribution effectiveness; third, improving the customer experience in operating efficiency; and fourth, effective capital management including the ongoing runoff of Talcott. Let me address each of these briefly. Since 2011, we have been expanding the P&C product suite and underwriting tools to diversify our business mix and meet changing customer needs. As you know, the initial focus in P&C Commercial was expanding our property and liability expertise to complement the existing workers compensation capabilities and we are pleased with the progress in these areas. We continue to add new capabilities to allow us to meet more of the insurance needs for broader range of customers. Over the last year, we have updated our commercial auto underwriting tools, addressing changing trends in that market. We also recently signed a new property reinsurance program that enables us to underwrite accounts with up to $500 million of covered property per location. Finally, we remain focused on expanding the voluntary product suite and group benefits, preparing for a more employee centric model as the market adjusted to the new healthcare environment. Employee choice benefits is an expanded group benefits of voluntary offering, which is being rolled out with customized educational materials to help employees to make informed decisions about their benefits. On the distribution side with the ongoing consolidation of the brokers and agent channel, it is more important than ever that we offer intermediaries, products and services that position us as a go-to provider for their customer needs. More than 11,000 agents and brokers are licensed to do business with The Hartford. Our objective is to continue to effectively serve larger brokers and agents by anticipating and meeting the needs of their evolving business models, while also continuing to serve and support the thousands of agents who are the lifeboat of small commercial, and consumer markets businesses. For example, the market leading ICON platform in small commercial helps agents of all sizes to get customer quotes in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, our award winning operation centers effectively handle customer service for many distribution partners, bringing them to spend more of their time on business generation. Our third area of focus is improving the customer experience and increasing operating efficiency. Well, The Hartford has strong capabilities in claims and policyholder servicing. We have the opportunity to significantly improve the back office\u2019s efficiency and the customer experience with the previously announced investment commitment to improve our technology infrastructure. The objective is to increase The Hartford\u2019s ease of doing business and put the ultimate customer at the center of our activities. One example is the ongoing rollout of a new P&C claim system, which will improve claims efficiency, enhanced by new data and predictive analytic capabilities. We are also working to upgrade digital and customer self service functionality across the P&C operations. These enhanced capabilities will help continue to differentiate The Hartford. Finally, capital management will be a critical element as we redeploy excess capital from two sources, the go forward businesses and Talcott Resolution. With improving fundamentals, the P&C companies are positioned to continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital. In addition with the recent corporate reorganization both the group benefits and the mutual fund companies now represent independent sources of dividends to the holding company. As we have discussed previously, we also intend to return capital to the holding company from Talcott over time both through the generation of statutory earnings and the runoff of the legacy annuity liabilities. In combination, capital generation from the businesses and from Talcott will continue to provide The Hartford\u2019s flexibility to pursue a broad range of capital management actions while we invest in new capabilities to drive future profitable growth. In closing, I\u2019m confident that The Hartford is on the right track to achieve our goals of the higher ROE and growing book value per share. During the third quarter, we made progress in each of the four areas that I discussed today and we are committed to continue their progress in the quarters and years ahead. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning. We posted an outstanding quarter across our property, casualty, and group benefit businesses. We\u2019re very focused on execution in our frontline teams where we worked closely with our distribution partners and make critical risk selection decisions. We believe that our energy here is paying off as we optimize pricing and retention to drive franchise value over the long-term. Let me share some highlights by business beginning with P&C commercial, consumer, and then group benefits. Our results in P&C Commercial remain very consistent with recent quarters. Strong underlying margins were driven by written pricing gains, sound underwriting management, and growth in our target business lines. We feel very good about our performance as the market shows signs of increased price competition. For the quarter, we delivered core earnings of $268 million, up $92 million versus prior year on an all in combined ratio of 90.4. Very low current accident year catastrophe losses in the quarter contributed $26 million to the improvement. The balance of core earnings increased is largely due to improved margins and slightly favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio excluding CATs and prior year development was 90.2%, an improvement of 3.1 points versus prior year. These financial results reflect our operating focus and discipline and give us confidence that we\u2019re making sound strategic and tactical decisions. On the top line total written premium was up 1%, excluding our programs business P&C Commercial grew 4% for the third quarter. We also achieved written pricing gains of 5% for standard commercial outpacing current loss cost trends. While the measurement of writing pricing and loss cost is essential to our business. Our management of profitability is far more sophisticated than these two overall metrics convey. Detailed insights drive our risk decisions, especially as written pricing and loss cost trends are converging. In every book of business, there are cohorts that are performing below targets. These might be defined by geography, industry class or underwriting profile just to name a few. Calling this business and taking corrective action is central to achieving and maintaining target margins. That\u2019s why I always say there is more work to be done whether it is in certain lines of business or specific risk classes we need to remain keenly focused on our operating risk discussions on an account-by-account basis. Let\u2019s now take a more in-depth look at the results of our P&C Commercial businesses. Our performance in small commercial demonstrates the ongoing strength and momentum we\u2019ve developed in this business. The third quarter underlying combined ratio was 85.6, 1.5 points better than 2013. The all-in combine ratio was 86.4. Written premium grew 7% driven by new business premium growth of 11% and policy retention at 84. Both the new business growth rate and the policy retention rate were consistent with trends in the second quarter of this year reinforcing our strong momentum as we had for year-end. As Chris noted, we\u2019re very excited to see our investments in this business coming together to deliver exceptional financial performance. In addition to our excellent technology and customer service platforms, we have robust analytics running behind the scenes on every facet of this business. We are successfully balancing growth and profit because we know where the business opportunities exists, we understand loss trends at the most granular levels, and we\u2019re partnering with our agents to manage pricing, appetite and growth. Moving to Middle Market, we continue to make steady progress with an underlying combine ratio of 92 down 3.9 points versus prior year. Renewal written pricing remained ahead of loss cost trends building on our margin improvement from recent years. I\u2019m especially pleased to note that our underlying combined ratio in Middle Market workers compensation is down over 8 points for the quarter versus last year. After several years of disciplined pricing and underwriting actions on this book of business, it\u2019s gratifying to see the combined ratio within our target range. Written premium growth in Middle Market was 3% driven in part by solid results in property and general liability as we continue to have success in building our new business mix. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve made several important changes to strengthen leadership in a number of geographies and to better align our field organization with key distribution partners. These actions help to deliver new business of $112 million, up $5 million from a year ago and consistent with second quarter 2014. We view our Middle Market written pricing trends averaging in the mid single-digit range this quarter as being quite strong given our improved overall profitably since 2012. Commercial auto continues to lead the way for written pricing increases. I expect just to continue as we suspect many others are not at our target combined ratios for this line. Increased bodily injury severity is the primary driver, which we will continue to address through rate increases and underwriting actions. In National Accounts, written premium was down 9% for the quarter, a sizable strength in the growth we posted in recent quarters. The decline is largely attributable to uneven timing of premium flows. When we peel back our operating metrics, we continue to see positive performance indicators within our core earnings. our retention rates remain above 90%. We\u2019re writing two new accounts for everyone lost slightly behind our 2013 page, but still very solid. We\u2019ve been successful in growing this book of business over the last several years. We like our competitive niche and we\u2019re confident in our plan for growth and profitability. In Financial Products, we had a solid quarter with written premium up 7%. This growth is coming in our E&O business where we\u2019ve developed some very strong industry-based solutions. In the E&O, we\u2019re seeing greater competition in the largest segment and we\u2019re tightly managing to our pricing standards. Shifting over to consumer, we posted an all-in combined ratio of 91.2. excluding capacities and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio was 89.4, improving 1.7 points from a year ago, largely driven by lower expenses. Cat loss is well below our expectations. We\u2019re above our experience in 2013. Last quarter, we shared that weather and fire losses adversely affected both auto and homeowner\u2019s results. We have not seen any unusual patterns emerge and the third quarter was back in line with our expectations. On the top line, written premium was up 3%, driven by continued success with our AARP through agents offering, where new business was up 11%. Auto and home renewal written pricing increases were 5% and 7% respectively, and we remain focused on improving rate adequacy, particularly in the homeowners\u2019 line. Our expense ratio decreased this quarter to 23.1, which is essentially flat with the second quarter. We are ramping up spending in the fourth quarter on several technology projects and new business marketing efforts and we anticipate our full-year expense ratio will be approximately 23.7. And finally, let me shift the group benefits, we have core earnings of $38 million, were up 6% from last year. Recall that the third party marketing relationship in our association financial institutions block will be terminated as of year-end, but will still be included in our year-over-year comparisons are based my comments now on results excluding this business. We continue to see profit improvements driven by favorable life and disability results. The life loss ratio was down 2.9 points, due to continued pricing discipline and favorable mortality. Disability trends also remained favorable for prior year with the loss ratio improving 2.2 points that we\u2019re beginning to see the rate of that improvement decelerate. Long-term disability incident trends continue to be favorable, while claim recoveries were lower than prior year, although still in line with historical norms. Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium declined 2%, compared to prior year. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business exceeded 90% year-to-date through September and we\u2019re very pleased with our renewal pricing adequacy. Fully insured ongoing sales of $57 million for the quarter, was essentially flat with last year. Given the lead times on large account business, we can see that 2015 is shaping up positively. Sales activity has increased and we\u2019re encouraged that our recent investments, particularly those to enhance our product, service and claim capabilities are resonating with customers. In fact, we will welcome back several large case customers in the first quarter. As Chris noted in his opening, our overall suite of capabilities is allowing us to compete more effectively to win cases and then achieve greater employee participation through effective marketing and enrollment tools. These are positive signs for us. We like everyone else are adapting to the changing benefit landscape and we\u2019re very pleased with our progress. Let me now wrap up by noting again, this is a very strong quarter for us across P&C and Group Benefits. We remain disciplined, thoughtfully managing our renewals and finding spots to compete aggressively for new business. We have a franchise that is getting stronger every quarter and we\u2019re focused on bringing shareholder value over the long-term. Now, let me turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara :  Thank you, Doug. Last evening, we reported third quarter core earnings of $477 million, or $1.06 per diluted share. The results reflect improved profitability in our P&C group benefits and mutual funds businesses, as well as favorable catastrophes and prior-year development. The impact of better than budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior-year development totaled $68 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share. In addition to these items, we also benefited from strong limited partnership returns of $100 million before tax for an annualized yield of 14%. Net income for the quarter was $388 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared with the net income of $293 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013. The largest non-core earnings items this quarter was DAC unlock charge of $102 million after tax about equal to last year. This year\u2019s DAC unlock included a charge of $84 million after tax for annual policy holder assumptions review, reflecting modest changes in last benefit utilization expense and rate assumptions. This quarter do not have any impact from discontinued operations given the sale of our Japan business in the second quarter. However, third quarter 2013 included a loss and discontinued operations of $72 million from the Japan business. P&C Group Benefits and mutual funds generated core earnings of $413 million, up 30% compared with $317 million in the third quarter of 2013, due to improved underwriting margins and P&C including lower catastrophe losses, improved results from group benefits and mutual funds and higher limited partnership income. That covers the results from P&C and Group Benefits, so I will briefly cover the other segments. Mutual funds core earnings rose 22% over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in average retail and return in mutual fund assets under management compared with the third quarter of 2013. Performance remains solid, with 76% of funds outperforming their peers over the last five years. Mutual funds sales remain strong at $3.8 billion and equity fund sales rose 11%. Redemptions continue to decline resulting in positive net close for the third quarter in a row, after adjusting for the liquidation of our target date funds at the second quarter. Excluding that liquidation year-to-date, net close were positive by nearly $400 million. Note that in October, we moved the management of some VA in retirement funds from the mutual fund segment to our investment operations. For reporting purposes this internal move will result in an outflow of approximately $2 billion from annuity mutual funds and about $700 million from retirement mutual funds in the fourth quarter. There will be no significant impact on mutual funds earnings as a result of this move. Talcott\u2019s core earnings for the quarter were $122 million, which was above our outlook for several reasons, including lower than expected ESV and ISV program cost and higher investment income including limited partnership income. We continue to see a steady run-off of our U.S. VA business, where contracts have declined more than 13% since September 30, 2013. Fixed annuity contracts decreased by 5% during the quarter and are down 19% since a year ago. Although expenses for the ISV and ESV annuity programs were lower than expected this quarter, the surrender activity for both of these programs was in line with our overall expectations. In the Corporate segment, core losses totaled $58 million, up from $16 million in the third quarter of 2013. Both quarters had favorable items. The third quarter of 2013 include a total of $55 million of benefits related to recoveries for past legal expenses on closed litigation and a favorable settlement on liabilities at the company\u2019s former parent. The third quarter of this year included $7 million of legal expense recoveries. Keep in mind that the principal driver of the losses in the corporate segment is interest expense, which we expect to decline in the future because of our debt capital management plan. We intend to repay two 2015 maturities that totaled $456 million and also to spend up to $500 million to call or tender for debt under the current capital management plan. However, with the recent change in market conditions we expect to execute the $500 million call or tender in 2015 rather than by year-end 2014. Our investment portfolio continues to generate solid investment returns with modest impairments. Portfolio yields have held up well despite the low interest rate environment without any material change in our credit risk or portfolio duration. Excluding limited partnerships, the average pre-tax portfolio yield was 4.1%, consistent with the second quarter and down slightly from 4.2% in third quarter 2013. Total investment income increased 3% from the prior year quarter, which is principally due to higher limited partnership income partially offset by the effect of lower asset. The Hartford\u2019s book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at September 30, 2014 was $39.82, up 1% from year-end and 2% from September 30, 2013. The growth in book value per share over the last year was due to the positive impact of net income and share repurchases, partially offset by shareholder dividends. During the third quarter, we used $845 million to repurchase common shares. We repurchased $320 million or 8.9 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $35.78 per share. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, we began in July we paid $525 million and took delivery of 11.2 million shares during the quarter. This program has not yet been completed. Based on the volume weighted average stock price through September 30, 2014 there were approximately 3.5 million shares yet to be delivered under the ASR. In total, through September 30, we have used about $1.5 million to repurchase common shares under our 2014, 2015 program, which will be little less than $1.3 billion to be repurchased through 2015. As you know, one of our key goal is to drive our core ROE to a level that exceeds our cost of equity capital. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2014, our core earnings ROE rose 8.2%, compared to the 6.4% of September 30, 2013, reflecting the growth in core earnings, as well as the impact of our capital management program. Our cost of equity capital has come down, reflecting our restructuring action. We expected to continue to decline as Talcott runs off and the Company\u2019s earnings volatility and risk profile become more in line with our P&C peers. Finally, before turning to your questions let me provide a brief summary of our fourth quarter outlook. Our core earnings outlook for the fourth quarter is in a range of $375 million to $400 million or $0.85 to $0.91 per diluted share assuming about 440 million shares outstanding. This outlook assumes catastrophe losses of about 2.5 points on the combined ratio or $42 million after tax and about $5 million after tax of prior year development for worker\u2019s compensation accretion. Talcott core earnings are projected at $90 million to $95 million and Group benefits is expected to be in the low to mid 40s, down from $55 million last year, which had included some favorable items. In addition, keep in mind that limited partnership returns were strong in last year, averaging 11% annualized while our outlook for the fourth quarter assumes 6% annualized yield from limited partnership. To wrap up, the third quarter was another quarter of significant progress. P&C and Group Benefits and Mutual Funds results were outstanding and we repurchased a substantial amount of equity under our capital management plan. We are pleased with our progress this year and remain optimistic about the future. We look forward to sharing our 2015 outlook with you in February, when we report fourth quarter financial results. I will now turn the call over to Sabra to begin the Q&A session. Sabra R. Purtill: Thank you, Beth. Before opening up the call for the Q&A period, I wanted to note upcoming dates for The Hartford. First please note that Chris, Doug, and Beth will be at the Goldman Sachs Insurance Conference in New York City on December 9th and we hope to see many of you there. In addition, as Beth mentioned, we expect to announce our fourth quarter results and our 2015 outlook on February 2nd with a call on the morning of February 3rd. Please note that consistent with the prior years on call on the morning of February 3rd will be a little bit longer than our normal quarterly call and we will note that and hopefully you can plan accordingly. Tiffany, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions at this time? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two things, first the small commercial property and casualty insurance earned premium growth of 7%. It looks like that\u2019s the fastest versus second quarter of 2012. Policy-in-force growth was modestly positive. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what contributions were delivering that strong growth, is it more new business or pricing? Doug Elliot : Jay, good morning, this is Doug. I think it\u2019s a combination of all, right. So we had steady progress across the pricing front. Our new business numbers that we layout in the sub but were also very strong in the quarter. And the combination that now we have in the entire platform are our ICON platform with all the products in it is being very well received by the marketplace. So we\u2019re hitting nicely across the board and I expect that moment to continue. Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then on a separate issue, I believe for Beth. For the Talcott earnings, we understand the guidance for 4Q, I believe previously it might have been either you or Chris did give the expectation for Talcott earnings growth for 2015 in terms of how \u2013 what order of magnitude that would decline? And if you could update us there that would be helpful, just so we can square our models. Beth Bombara : So we I don\u2019t believe have given an outlook for 2015 as it relates to GAAP earnings for Talcott. I believe we\u2019ve talked about in the past is cash free earnings generation in and around that $250 million to $300 million range. As far as the runoff of the block for your models, it suggest that as you look at our surrender rate and you can view that as a proxy as you think about the earnings in that book declining offset by the fact that we have seen market improvement for that has the counter effect of improving the fees that we get on the accepting block. Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Okay. Any other insight you can provide there or it\u2019s a bit of a moving target? Beth Bombara :  Then I think we\u2019ll provide more insight when we get \u2013 in February when we talk about our outlook for 2015. Jay H. Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW. Your line is open. Vincent M. DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just to start with two comp questions. So one of the things that we\u2019ve, I guess, heard more often in the industry is, some of your peers trying to put on as much profitable business right now, particularly in small commercial workers comp. And so, the thought process here that we\u2019re hearing is that your peers want to put on as much profitable business on the small commercial side since it\u2019s sticky and then from that essentially have a profitable base to work through the next cycle. And so, as we kind of look at your results and see the strong and consistent small commercial underwriting result and profitability and then also seeing your retention coming up, I\u2019m curious if you guys are taking a similar approach? And then secondly, we\u2019re hearing a lot of chatter around the strategy. Does that imply that we really are within workers comp starting to see that markets often? Doug Elliot : Vince, good morning, this is Doug. A few thoughts for you. One is that we\u2019re very bullish about what we\u2019re doing in the marketplace in small commercial in both platforms. And more importantly, results-wise and we share those results with you. So as we think about areas we want to grow this franchise, clearly small commercial is right in the top row of that discussion. Secondly, workers comp is a big product relative to our small commercial offering. It\u2019s been a profitable product work for us. It continues to be profitable and I expect that history to move forward in a very good trajectory. So we\u2019ve got aggressive plan moving forward. I\u2019m pleased with the progress in the third quarter, expect that to continue and I think we\u2019re seen as a market leader in this space. Vincent M. DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Good call there and just a little bit more granular. So we\u2019ve also heard that New York and California from the comp side has been particularly challenging. I just wanted to see how the states are performing for you guys since I think they are two of your largest, and then more broadly, how loss trends maybe playing out between mid-market and small commercial within workers comp? Doug Elliot : Good. So few questions inside your second piece. First, there are some headwinds in a few of the states relative to filings. I would say that those headwinds really are correlated to loss experience that has been improving across the books of business. So, not total surprised. As we look at the performance and the adequacy of our book still feel very, very good about that and we\u2019ll continue and monitor closely and obviously with the workers compensation line, as you suggest, it is a state-by-state march, very geographic centric. Second part of your question, middle versus small. As I commented in my earlier remarks, we are very pleased of our progress on our workers\u2019 compensation book in the middle, slightly different tenancies, in our small book we tend to be on the micro end of small, but again, we see good signs on the frequency end; very-very low to minus frequency across both our books of business and the severity dynamics both wage and other have been very moderate over these past couple of years, so, to us the all-in loss trends are very much in check. Vincent M. DeAugustino \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Good deal. Nice quarter. Christopher J. Swift: Thanks. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Yes, thanks. Good morning, couple of questions here. First, just on the reinsurance program you talked about the new property reinsurance, which related to $500 million per risk. Number one, was that alternative capacity, traditional capacity and then on the top of the reinsurance any other initiatives that you are looking at right now, i.e. internal reinsurance type programs to take advantage of the more competitive reinsurance market? And I have a follow-up. Christopher J. Swift: Brian, it\u2019s Chris. Thank you for your question and joining us today. The $500 million per location policy was traditional. Reinsurance they are working with our long time partners. So, we feel good about it, gives us the opportunity to expand our property appetite in an appropriate fashion. I think, as it relates to \u2013 across the alternative capital in general, I know there has been a lot of discussions in \u2013 I think fundamental review is that \u2013 the market in general is just re-thinking how to support, risk taking in general and \u2013 but as it relates specifically to our books of business, I think we\u2019ve talked about it in the past. I mean we feel good about our reinsurance programs, the cost of it and I will call it the more permanent nature of it over longer period, over different cycles. So, we are aware and participate in a lot of discussions and explorations of what\u2019s feasible from an alternative capital. But we are not heavy users of reinsurance right now. But we will continue to push ourselves to see if there is something creative \u2013 that can help benefit our shareholders. Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Great and then second question, Doug. Curious, we\u2019ve seen a drop in gasoline prices, obviously with the big drop in oil prices. Have you guys seen any increase in frequency in the auto line or should we expect maybe that will start to pick-up here as we head into the holiday seasons? Doug Elliot : Our trends really have not changed much in the last quarter or so. We will certainly watch carefully and that may indeed happen with the holidays upon us, but at the moment I would say pretty much as they\u2019ve been. Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Doug Elliot : Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Market, your line is open. Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yes, great. Good morning. Thank you. I\u2019d like to follow-up on what Jay Gelb was asking a little bit on Talcott. And so, I think what we\u2019re hearing is that when we think about capital that can come out or they\u2019re going forward as kind of the corollary to estimating earnings. Is it true that we can take contract count decline and thus AUM decline as a good proxy for the decline in required capital at Talcott? Is that going to be a pretty linear read for us going forward? Beth Bombara : Randy, it\u2019s Beth. So, no, I was talking about earnings. When it relates to required capital, as we talked about in the past, a reduction is required. So that capital is not going to be on linear path on as the book runs off. It obviously will decline over time and obviously impacts our views as to excess capital within Talcott, but it\u2019s not a linear calculation. Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Well, if it\u2019s not that, what would be our best kind of tool for estimating the draft and required capital? And while I\u2019m calling with this, the follow-up would be, I think, the RBC last was 500% there. So if required capital declines, it seems like RBC can be allowed to decline as well. So just trying to get a feel for how you can think about how capital could be freed up there as a result of these good surrender activities you\u2019re getting in Talcott? Beth Bombara : Okay, so a couple of things. First, as it relates to our views around required capital in the Talcott entities and what their needs are, as you know, that\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate. RBC is one thing that we do look at as it relates to that. I\u2019ll remind you that we focus on RBC requirements in a stress scenario, not just the printed RBC in this environment. But as we talked in the past, we have been working to evaluate what should be their appropriate target going forward, taking into consideration RBC target as well as other things like absolute levels of surplus and liquidity. And our expectation is that we will be sharing with you in February our views around the excess capital that we see in Talcott, as well as what we could see as a reasonable expectation and timetable for extracting that capital over time as the book continues to runoff. So I\u2019d ask you to wait until February, because I think we\u2019ll be able to provide you better information then that will help you see how we\u2019re thinking about the capital generation coming from the Talcott entities. Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Then just one more if I could. I mean, what is the printed RBC? If we\u2019re not going to change the stress case conversation right now, what is the printed RBCs as off right now in Talcott, as of the third quarter? Beth Bombara : So as of the third quarter, we\u2019re at about 500%. Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay, so 500%. Okay. Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open. Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker): Hi, thank you. If Doug, can you talk a little bit more about the growth outlook for group benefits, which it sounds like you\u2019re pretty positive in your prepared remarks, but how much activity are you seeing in the market and how our pricing trends and then maybe also are you starting to see any benefit to premiums from employment growth or higher wages? Liam E. McGee: Good morning, Erik. Maybe just a few comments and we\u2019ll be back in 90 days to give you the full 2015 layout. We are encouraged by the early look at some of our January 1 activity, which is why I shared the comments that I did. January just the beginning of the first quarter, but we\u2019ve had some nice success on both the new business front and feel good about our retention of key existing accounts. So let\u2019s leave it at that and we\u2019ll be back with a broader look in 2015 in a few months. Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker): Got it. I guess are you seeing any benefit though from just on existing business from either higher enrollments or employment growth? Liam E. McGee: We are working hard on our penetration inside existing accounts for sure. I would say that that work is ongoing. As you know we\u2019re really right in the throes of enrollment season, so I would had a better sense probably out 45 days and we can share maybe some of that at Goldman Sachs. We are seeing relatively small growth in the employment area, so don\u2019t think the numbers of workers in our major cases, it is driving significantly upwards, in general small positive growth. Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you and just one more follow-up on Talcott. I guess your fourth quarter guidance is higher than what you had been guiding for the third quarter initially. Is that\u2019s just because of lower expenses related to the ESV program or is there anything else driving that? Beth Bombara : Yes, so it\u2019s lower expenses for both ESV and ISV. There were two programs and then also as we\u2019ve seen markets improved a little bit of an uptake because of that as well. Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Christopher J. Swift: Erik, it\u2019s Chris. In addition to what Doug said, I guess what I\u2019m particularly pleased with the teams performance there is \u2013 I\u2019ll share with you more in early 2015, but a number of clients, I would say large ones that we lost maybe three years ago between our replacing and some of our activities. I\u2019m going to come back to the form. And I think that\u2019s just speaks to one of our reputation, our claim handling capabilities, and just the power of the group benefits franchise, so more to come as Doug said, but I\u2019m particularly pleased with our new sales activities and old clients returning back to us. Erik J. Bass \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you for the additional color. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open. John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Hi, good morning everybody and congrats on a very solid quarter. A question for Doug, on the P&C commercial side, so we\u2019re seeing pricing begin to decline a bit, but it\u2019s still above your estimated loss cost trends. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any change in your outlook. Yes, I know, it\u2019s maybe a little bit premature, you want to talk about 2015 in a few months, but are you still expecting that you can generate improvement in the accident, your combined ratio moving forward maybe recognizing that some of the non-cat impacts have been probably a little bit below, what you have been pricing for. Doug Elliot : Yes, good question, tough question and a critical one. We have seen the market become increasingly competitive over the last several months and I comment on that in my script. John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Yes. Doug Elliot : : So, putting all this in one basket, I continue to describe the overall market place is generally rational. Especially in the sectors, we compete in, which largely or small commercial and middle. And that\u2019s important to us in our franchise and I share those results in terms of stability. It\u2019s hard for us to predict these competitive dynamics going out, what I can\u2019t tell you is that in the fourth quarter we intent to execute much in the way we had these last several quarters, which is we\u2019re working hard to renew our best performing accounts and driving pricing in terms of those accounts that need improvement. And I think, you know, our history we\u2019re not afraid to walk away from accounts that we believe, we can\u2019t get to price adequacy. So, our price is going to be very consistent, going to watch the market place, we\u2019re still on top of last trend and I expect that to continue in the fourth quarter and then we\u2019ll talk more as we get out to January about 2015. John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay, really helpful. And then maybe a question for you to Chris or Beth. Just coming back to Talcott in sort of the historical look at a stress scenario in maintaining that 325% risk-based capital ratio, I know that\u2019s not the only metric, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019ve talked about pretty consistently now for a couple of years. Given so much change and so much reduction in risk in that segment and I noticed you also mentioned a very high proportion of the remaining variable annuity reserve outside of surrender charge at this point. So potentially, we could see that surrender rate continue to stay very elevated here. I\u2019m just wondering whether you have actually finalized yet of you on whether the $325 million stress target income down and if so by how much? Christopher J. Swift: Hey, John, it\u2019s Chris. John M. Nadel \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Hi, Chris. Christopher J. Swift: Let me just \u2013 I\u2019ll remind the units \u2013 let me just philosophically rate, remind you. I know you know this and others but we really want to run Talcott to be capital self-sufficient particularly in a stress scenario, so that philosophy is unchanged. John M. Nadel \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Yep. Christopher J. Swift: You\u2019re referencing the $325 million and all I would tell you is again it\u2019s best that \u2013 we\u2019ll cover more in early 2015, but we know that could come down. So it is going to be different going forward, we\u2019re working our process with our various constituencies, but particularly our regulators. So I believe we\u2019ll have an acceptable outcome that will talk through in early 2015. Beth, I don\u2019t if you would add anything more? Beth Bombara :  No, I think you said it very well. John M. Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Yes, that\u2019s very helpful, thanks. Look forward to February. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Yes, thank you. I\u2019ve got two questions, the first is you admission that the underlying portfolio yield in your investment portfolio held up pretty well without taking much more risk and seems to defy gravity given we know about the interest rate environment. Can you just talk about how that occurred and why that occurred? Christopher J. Swift: Jay, it\u2019s Chris. I think \u2013 if you really look at the numbers this quarter that I think Beth talked to is our reinvestment rate was about 3.6%, the maturity I\u2019ll call it securities rolling off this quarter were 3.7%. So I think again our HIMCO professionals continue to look for the right opportunities, I don\u2019t think we are stretchy from a risk side. But we do have also had some core capabilities and real estate, mortgage loans I\u2019ll call it private placement that offers the opportunity to be very selective and try to get the best yield for the risk of return trade off. Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, thank you. Second question on the commercial business, the expense ratio is kind of last couple of quarters has really been at the higher end and where it has been for the past three years. I think you\u2019re making investments in that business. Do you think this is sort of a peak-ish number or could we see that never rise a bit further, as you continue to invest in the business? Doug Elliot : Jay, good morning, this is Doug. When we think about the expense these were really are balancing two parts of equation, one part is that we\u2019re investing back inside these business particularly on the technology side, so obviously, that\u2019s working against this relative to absolutes here, but we have a number of initiatives inside our businesses where we\u2019re looking at expense opportunities in general, we\u2019re harvesting ideas that are going to make us some more efficient, productive, place over time where that is particularly relevant is clearly in the middle market, as you know in the last couple of years, our middle market top line has come down a little bit between 2011 and 2013. And so we\u2019ve got some experienced pressures there that we are coming aggressive with making adjustments forward. But albeit looking out, I\u2019m pretty comfortable with where we are today and very pleased with the trade off we\u2019re making between invest and overall outcome relative to combined ratio and margins. Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So this is not \u2013 it is sort of a peak-ish number. we wouldn\u2019t expect that to rise further from here, unless obviously the top line changes noticeably? Doug Elliot : Certainly, true. correct. Jay A. Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Good morning. Just a quick one for Doug and then one for Chris or Beth. So Doug, just I guess given what you mentioned on workers\u2019 comp, now hitting return hurdles, I presume that\u2019s an overall comment and I guess Commercial Auto is the other business where you had beginning rate, any \u2013 fair to say the heavy lifting is behind you from a rate standpoint, or any other businesses where you expect to get significant rate? Doug Elliot : Tom, good morning. I would say that our comp strategy now is fine tuning and working the edges both in middle market and also in small. I did comment that we are still re-underwriting and working aggressively on the pricing front with auto, and that\u2019s a comment again, both across middle and small commercial as well. The property, and liability, and our specialty books all have different strategies and I would suggest to you that our pricing mean is probably not as aggressive there as we are approaching the marketplace in auto. So somewhere in the mid single digits three to six range probably for the other lines. Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. And just shifting gears to Beth or Chris. so if I look at the initial 2014 and 2015 capital plan was split 80% buybacks and 20% debt reduction. and then if I look at the Japan sale got a bit more conservatives, led 60% buybacks, 40% debt reduction. So my question is, as we think about how would Hartford capital go down in the future, how should we think about that split? Beth Bombara : So Tom, it\u2019s Beth. I\u2019ll take that. So what we\u2019ve said in the past is that any capital management actions that we would take in the future will continue to be balanced. We\u2019re very mindful looking at what our leverage and coverage ratios are and as we\u2019ve said our goal is overtime to be in the low 20s and so any actions we take we\u2019ll continue to the balance that. So it\u2019s not as I can say it\u2019s an exact percentage. It\u2019ll really be based on the amount and looking at overall of those factors as we think about the balance sheet going forward. Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : So, Beth, as a follow-up then. Since you\u2019re still above low 20s right now, it\u2019s fair to say that if you had extraordinary capital return actions on Talcott you probably lean more towards the conservative end of it, until you hit the low 20s threshold? Beth Bombara :  So the low 20s is a target, we haven\u2019t set necessary a time table for working to when we want to achieve that, we\u2019ll just continue to be balance. So what I would say to you is I\u2019d expect there to be a continuation of both, but not necessarily that we\u2019re trying to be overly conservative. Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  And then, so just one last one if I could sneak it in from a tactical standpoint, why bother with tendering for debt? Why not just sit on the cash, earn some yield, and pay it off as you go? I guess you have some fairly big maturities in 2017. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s too long to wait or what the view of tendering versus sitting on the cash and waiting to pay maturities. Beth Bombara : So again, our view has been that we do want to reduce the leverage on the balance sheet. When we look at the cost of a tender or call, we obviously take that into consideration to some extent what you pay in the PB calculation on that kind of takes into consideration about that, you won\u2019t be paying that interest in the future. So for us it\u2019s really a way to get us to our targets. And we\u2019ll continue to look for the best way to execute that at the best price. Tom G. Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Your line is open. Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : Good morning, Hartford. A question on hedging costs, which I don\u2019t think you breakout anymore with Japan, outage come down and clearly your assets are coming down against the dollar is up and interest rates are down. Any guidance just sort of the rough run rate of hedging costs that are below the line? Beth Bombara : So, Bob this is Beth. So as it relates to our U.S. VA book in the way that we thought about the spend for both the WB program and the macro program we\u2019ve really haven\u2019t changed those targets. I would say the macro program has probably cost us a little bit less. We used to talk about it in $5 million range, a couple \u2013 spending a little less than that now, but we really haven\u2019t changed our views on hedging. But you can see in our results because we still do breakout the VA hedging results that they were very modest for the quarter, which is what we\u2019d expect going forward with Japan, no longer in our result. Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : I\u2019m sorry. The $75 million refers to what? Beth Bombara :  What we refer to is the macro hedge program. Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : Okay. That\u2019s continuing or that\u2019s not continuing? Beth Bombara : So we are continuing the macro hedge program. It\u2019s just that the cost of that program has come down a bit given market conditions. Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : And that\u2019s below the line or is that in core earnings? Beth Bombara : All of the hedging costs are below the line. Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d turn the conference back over to our presenters. Sabra R. Purtill:  Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us today and your interest in The Hartford. Certainly if you have any follow-up questions about the quarter or other items, please contact either Sean or myself by phone or e-mail and we\u2019ll get back to you as quickly as we can today. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 2014 was an outstanding year for The Hartford. We continued the execution of our strategy and created value for shareholders. We accelerated the transformation of the company by expanding profit margins and increasing ROEs and P&C and Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. Our selling the Japan Annuity business and reducing risk in Talcott, returning over $2 billion of capital to The Hartford shareholder and executing a seamless leadership transition. I want to thank Liam, the Board, the management team and all our employees for contributing to a great year. Last night, we reported outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Full year core earnings increased 9% to $1.55 billion. On a fully diluted per share basis, core earnings grew 16%, reflecting profitable growth and effective capital management. The core ROE increased to 8.4% in 2014, a full 1 point increase over prior year. Core earnings growth was driven by margin expansion in P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, and solid topline growth in P&C. We achieved an almost 3-point year-over-year improvement in underlying combined ratio in P&C. The Hartford\u2019s pricing discipline and investments in new products and capabilities are producing strong results. Strong profitability recovery continued in Group Benefits, with the core earnings margin rising almost a point in 2014 to 5.2%. I'm very pleased with how our businesses are balancing margins and topline growth in this market environment. The Japan sale was another critical accomplishment in 2014. The transaction significantly improved the company's risk profile and enabled us to increase our capital management program. During the year we return more than $2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of equity repurchases and dividends. We also reduce holding company debt by $200 million. Before we move into 2015\u2019s outlook, I want to touch upon an important event that we originally expected in 2014, the Passage of TRIA. The TRIA legislation has been and continues to be critically important to policyholders that rely on the availability of terrorism insurance. We appreciate the efforts of Congress and the administration to enable its passage. Now let\u2019s turn to 2015. We expect to generate core earnings between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion. As Beth will cover in more detail, adjusting for 2014\u2019s low catastrophe losses, strong limited partnership returns and prior year development, earnings growth from P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds is expected to more than offset the anticipated decline in Talcott earnings. As Doug will detail, we are striving to expand our margins in 2015, recognizing the pricing and interest rate environment has become more challenging. In P&C, we are optimistic that targeted pricing actions and enhanced capabilities will allow us to drive modest improvements in the underlying combined ratio. In Group Benefits, the core margin is expected to be relatively stable. We foresee continued improvement in disability loss trends, but expect that to be offset by a reversion to more typical life mortality. We expect the key story in Group Benefits to be a topline growth recovery. Recent sales activity suggest The Hartford strength in claim handling and service are making a difference with customers. We are committed to improving The Hartford\u2019s ROE and growing book value per share to drive top quartile shareholder returns. As I discussed last quarter, we will focus our activities in four major areas, expanding product and underwriting capabilities, increasing distribution effectiveness, improving the customer experience and operating efficiency, and effectively managing capital, including the ongoing runoff of Talcott. We continue to add new product and underwriting capabilities to meet the needs of a broader range of policyholders. In 2015, we intend to introduce new industry verticals in middle market and to strengthen our underwriting presence in geographies where we have been underrepresented. In Group Benefits, we have expanded our voluntary product suite to include disability flex, critical illness and accident coverages. These products and underwriting initiatives strengthen our relationship with brokers and agents by helping them better serve their clients. In addition, we seek to extend our distribution in 2015. The micro segment of small commercial is best served by a multi-channel distribution strategy. We are aggressively moving in that direction with an AARP endorsed offering and other initiatives that will bring increased complicity and speed to small business owners and our distribution partners. We are also investing in technologies that will improve the customer experience and create operating efficiencies. The early feedback from the rollout of our new P&C claim systems has been very positive. The system promises to improve claims handling, efficiency and consistency, as well as the entire claims experience for the policyholder and the agent. Finally, effective capital management will continue to be -- will be continued to be critical in meeting the company\u2019s strategic goals. We plan to take $1.5 billion in dividends from the Talcott legal entities by early 2016, $500 million of which was completed in January, as we begin to appropriately reduce the amount of excess capital in Talcott to reflect its runoff status. This excess capital will provide the company with significant financial flexibility for future capital actions and investments in new capabilities. As I reflect on the past 12 months, it is clear that this has been a pivotal year for The Hartford, with the sale of Japan and the significant improvements in P&C and Group Benefits, the company strategic transformation and restructuring is essentially complete. The Hartford enters 2015 as a strong competitor in each of our markets. We have supplemented existing strengths in underwriting and claims, with enhanced capabilities and product, distribution and service. The company is positioned to create shareholder value going forward on a consistent and sustainable basis. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll cover the 2014 highlights for Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts for 2015. First, let me quickly remind you that I'll be discussing our results under the new Commercial Lines business alignment we disclose several weeks ago. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance across the Board. Our results were achieved through sound risk selection decisions, outstanding execution across our product and field organizations, and our relentless focus on getting right all the small things that go into a market-leading franchise. Before I cover our results, I want to touch on a few broad themes affecting our businesses, both in 2014 and as we look forward to 2015. First, while 2014 accident year catastrophes and P&C were slightly higher than 2013, losses were below our expectations for second year. We will take the good news, but we won't plan for it to continue. We still follow our rigorous process to manager cat exposures over the long-term. Second is net investment income, which trended down for the year and recent movement in treasury yields suggest that we aren\u2019t likely to see reversal anytime soon, this demand that we stay vigilant on our pricing and actively monitor competitive forces in 2015. Beth will have some additional perspective on our investment portfolio in her comments. Turning to our financial results, in Commercial Lines, we delivered $996 million of core earnings for the full year on an all -- all in combined ratio of 93.4. This was an earnings increase of $169 million from 2013, largely driven by 4.7 points of improvement in the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior year development was 91.5 for the year, representing 3.6 points of fundamental margin improvement. On the topline, our written premium of $6.4 billion was up 3% from 2013. Excluding the written premium declines in our programs business due to non-renewal actions taken in 2013, growth was 5%. New business momentum was building in the back half of 2013, particularly in small, commercial and middle market and that momentum carried into our 2014 results. On balance, we are extremely pleased with our competitive positioning in the market and our prospects for profitable growth. Let me offer some details on that by looking at each of our commercial business units, starting with small commercial. Our Small Commercial business continues to excel with its unique skills and product distribution and service. Our focus on customers and distributors has propelled us for a very strong market position. Written premium for the year grew 5%, aided by strong retentions. And the underlying combined ratio of 87% was 2.5 points better than 2013. New business was up 7% for the full year. We finished 2014 with three consecutive quarters of double-digit new business growth, driven by the full implementation of our coding application icon and other agency engagement initiatives. We continue to make investments in this business to drive competitive advantage. We are adding new online features for services and we launched the partnership with AARP to extend our small business services to their members. Moving to Middle-Market, I\u2019m pleased with our progress. The underlying combined ratio of 94.5% for the full year improved 4.5 points, much of this resulting from margin improvement and workers\u2019 compensation, the combination of years of underwriting and pricing actions. Written premium growth was 1%, but this now includes our programs business, which was still shedding business in 2013 and 2014. Excluding programs, middle-market written premium growth was 4%, largely driven by our strategy to expand non-workers\u2019 compensation line and deliver a more balanced book of business. Retentions were solid throughout the year and new business production of $458 million was up for the second year, much of our success in middle-market links directly to improved performance in the field. We have upped our game in underwriting, process effectiveness and agency engagement with new tools, better data and deeper analytics on the frontline. We are strengthening our risk capabilities to be a top partner for our distributors and customers, effectively underwriting and servicing an expanded array of new accounts. Within Specialty Commercial, results held steady with an underlying combined ratio of 100.2% for the full year, up slightly from 99.6 in 2013. National accounts posted another solid year with strong performance on both the top and bottom line. New business tapered off from 2013, which was a particularly active year. Nonetheless, written premiums were up 11% and account retention was in the low 90s. Our financial products business also had a strong year. The team has successfully repositioned this business and I'm confident that by more closely aligning with our middle-market operation, we can build a competitive advantage across Commercial Lines. Shifting over to Personal Lines, we delivered $210 million in core earnings, up 2% from prior year. Adjusting for Catalyst360, which we sold in 2013, core earnings actually grew 12%. The all-in combined ratio was 95.5% for the full year, improving 1.4 points versus 2013. Excluding catastrophes and prior-year development, the underlying combined ratio was 90.6, improving 1.7 points from last year. The improvement was mainly driven by lower marketing and technology related expenses. Written premium grew 4% for the year with continued strong performance from our AARP through agents offering. AARP Direct also posted modest growth from favorable retention and written pricing actions. During 2014, we rolled out our new auto product, Open Road in 32 states, increasing our pricing flexibility and improving our responsiveness to market trends. We also achieved greater efficiency in our AARP Direct acquisition process, improving our cost per conversion by 10%. Now let me pivot to Group Benefits. Core earnings for 2014 increased to $180 million, up 14% from 2013. That results in core earnings margin of 5.2%. We continue to see profit improvement driven by favorable Group Life and disability results. Excluding the effects from terminating and association, financial institutions\u2019 marketing arrangement, the 2014 group life loss ratio improved 3.4 points due to continued pricing discipline and favorable mortality. Disability trends also remained favorable compared to prior year, with the loss ratio improving 0.5 point. Long-term disability incident rates improved but at a slowing pace versus prior year. And claim recovery rates continued to be strong. Looking at the topline, fully insured ongoing premium excluding association, financial institutions, declined 2% for the full year. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business came in at 89% for the year and we've been very pleased with our renewal pricing adequacy. Fully insured ongoing sales excluding association, financial institution was $326 million for the year, down 12%. However, as we sit here today with considerable insight on the first quarter of 2015 activity, we are seeing a strong rebound in new sales. We are encouraged that our recent investments are enabling us to compete more effectively and close more cases. So as we wrap up 2014, we are pleased with our continued financial progress by the growing market strength of each business. Across our enterprise, we are seeing strong and still improving levels of employee engagement and a deep commitment to achieving even greater levels of success as we look to the future. This is what defines The Hartford and why our customers and distribution partners trust us with their most important insurance needs. Before I turn things over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on 2015. We continue to invest heavily in our capabilities as an enterprise, focused on areas of competitive advantage for each business. We've been on this journey for several years, making extensive progress in product development business metrics and easy-to-use technology applications for distributors, customers and employees alike. A great example is our new P&C claims management platform that will be completely rolled out by end of this year. It is already delivering value through improved claim rep performance, better customer experience and process efficiency. And the data analytics supported through the platform will be a source of innovation for years to come. I'm also very encouraged by the initiatives for each of our business units. We are having a strong run in small commercial and we have even greater aspirations. Our formula, based on customer value and innovation continue to separate us from the pack. This year, we will roll out enhancements to spectrum, our business owner\u2019s package policy, introduce new online services, and investing capabilities to better support distribution partners, as they pursue new marketing strategies and greater efficiencies for these small accounts. Our technology and service operations make us a go-to carrier and our investments will keep us on the leading edge of this market. In Middle-Market, we have a number of new initiatives in play to compete more broadly in the market. First, we are introducing a new underwriting cockpit that improves speed, support and data-driven insights for our team of professionals. Underwriters will be better equipped than ever to smartly compete for business. Second, we will begin deploying additional underwriting resources in targeted regions where we see new business upside. Working closely with our agents and brokers is critical to success and this demands local presence. And the third example of our focus is the build out of additional risk management professionals, specifically in engineering and loss control. We see this skill set is crucial for enabling our progress in new market sectors. These types of investments give us the opportunity to grow our middle-market business, not by competing solely on price but by bringing our strong value proposition to a larger share of the marketplace. Within Specialty Commercial, our major initiative will be leveraging the expertise of our financial products business. We now have a line, the strategy and management of financial products more closely with our Small Commercial and Middle-Market businesses. In addition, we continue to compete in the public D&O market. These teams will partner on product development and automation to create differentiated offering across commercial lines. We expect our overall commercial lines margin to remain generally stable with an underlying combined ratio between $89.5 million and $91.5 million. We will continue to seek improvement from a few pockets of lagging results such as commercial auto where we\u2019ll be aggressive with price increases and underwriting actions. In other well-performing lines, we will manage our pricing strategy to address long-term loss cost trends in individual account performance. We believe that our leadership and small commercial investments in Middle-Market provide the opportunity for profitable growth as we better deploy the capabilities we\u2019ve developed. In personal lines, we will bring even greater focus to our AARP direct business, with new product analytics and improved marketing test and learn capabilities, we\u2019re systematically improving response and conversion. We\u2019re also continuing to refine our AARP through agent\u2019s offering resulting in somewhat slower topline growth. We continue to be very excited about the quality of this business and believe that we can develop deeper partnerships with high-quality agents appointed for this program. Excluding catastrophes and prior year development, we expect the underlying combined ratio to be between 89% and 91%, a modest improvement in margins as we continue to focus on rate adequacy. In Group Benefits, we are very pleased to be positioned for topline growth with our book of business performing well. Renewal rates on business in the first quarter 2015 are very strong as is new sales activity. New sales with 1/1/15 effective date are up over 60% versus the year ago. And our win backs cases the last several years ago have now decided to come back to us, continue to be impressive and especially gratifying. Our service in claim capabilities are the reason. We truly have a differentiated experience and we\u2019re continuing to build on those capabilities. First, as we expand on the voluntary market, we\u2019re making additional investments in our products and capabilities to provide an even better experience in an increasingly consumer-driven market. Second, we\u2019re investing in an enhanced producer analytics and increased fuel resources aligned with targeted growth markets. We expect our Group Benefit\u2019s core earnings margin to be relatively stable between 5 and 5.5 with underwriting performance helping to offset declines in investment income. Overall across all of our businesses, we\u2019re focused on computing in an aggressive and disciplined manner. We believe that we have an opportunity to grow our business through smart product expansion and deeper local partnerships with our distributors. We have great scales in talents that can be deployed more widely without pushing beyond the boundaries of sound underwriting and risk selection. In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress in 2014 and excited to extend our reach in 2015. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to briefly cover the other businesses in key 2015 business metrics before turning to the capital outlook for Talcott and the holding company. Mutual Funds core earnings rose 17% in 2014, primarily due to an increase in fees from higher average assets under management, excluding Talcott related funds. As noted on slide 19, long-term fund performance remains solid with 64% of Mutual Funds outperforming their peers over the last five years. For the year, Mutual Fund sales were stable at $15.2 billion as a growth in equity fund sales was offset by reduced fixed income sale. During the year, we exited certain types of funds and transferred some funds to our investment operations, which resulted in negative Mutual Fund net flow of $1.4 billion. Adjusted for these items, net flows were about breakeven for the year. In 2015, we expect modest growth in core earnings as growth in Mutual Funds AUM will be partially offset by the continued runoff of funds included in Talcott\u2019s VA product. Talcott\u2019s core earnings summarized on slide 20 rose 5% for the year much better than originally expected due to higher limited partnership income and lower contract holder initiative cost. Contract counts continue to decline down year-over-year by 13% for variable annuities and 18% for fixed annuities. There has only been a modest decline in institutional covered life as the majority of the block consists of longer duration structured settlements and pension-related terminal funding liability. In 2015, we expect Talcott\u2019s core earnings to decline about 15% to 20% to a range of $340 million to $370 million. Almost half of this decline is due to lower projected limited partnership returns, which were 10% in 2014 versus 6% projected in 2015. Excluding the excess 2014 return in limited partnership income, core earnings are projected to be down around 10% in 2015 consistent with the runoff of the annuity blocks somewhat offset by lower expenses. Turning to the corporate segment on slide 21, 2014 core losses were about flat to the prior year. The 2015 core loss outlook of $235 million to $245 million is slightly better than 2014 due to lower interest expense from plan debt repayments in 2015. During 2015, we expect to spend up to $1 billion for debt management, which will help us move towards our long-term target of debt-to-total cap in the low 20s. Rating agency adjusted debt-to-total cap was 28.4% at December 31, 2014 or 26% pro formas for the projected 2015 repayments. Turning to investments on slide 22. We remain pleased with the credit performance of our portfolio with only $59 million of impairments in 2014, compared with $73 million in 2013. Investment yields, however, remained a challenge due to market conditions. Our portfolio yields have held up reasonably well in the low-interest rate environment, averaging 4.1% this year, excluding limited partnership or down about 10 basis points. Our 2015 outlook which is based on market yield curve projects a modest decline in the portfolio yield due to lower reinvestment rate. Our outlook for annualized P&C only pretax portfolio yield is 3.9%, including limited partnership. Turning to our capital management plan. Through January 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately $1.9 billion totaling 52 million shares for an average purchase price of $36.46 under the $2.775 billion share repurchase program and we paid $200 million of debt maturities on the $1.2 billion debt management program. Our core earnings outlook includes the impact of the completion of both programs in 2015 although the precise number of repurchased shares will depend on market prices. To summarize, as detailed on slide 24, core earnings in 2014 rose 9% to $1.5 billion which was the high end of the 2014 outlook. Core earnings per diluted share rose 16% to $3.36 due to the increase in core earnings and the impact of the capital management program. The core ROE rose to 8.4%. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at December 31, 2014, rose 4% to $40.71 from year end 2013, largely due to the capital management program. Shareholders\u2019 equity excluding AOCI declined 6% to $17.8 billion as the contribution of net income was more than offset by share repurchases and dividends. Our consolidated 2015 outlook, which, you can see on slide 25, is for core earnings of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, which at the midpoint is 7% above 2014 results once you exclude favorable items in 2014, such as CATs and limited partnership returns both better than outlook as well as unfavorable prior accident year development. On a per share basis, including an estimate of the impact of share repurchases during 2015, our earnings per diluted share would be approximately $3.65 to $3.85. Slide 25 lists several of the key business metrics for 2015, most of which we have already covered. Based on our 2015 outlook, we estimate an increase in core ROE to about 8.7% to 9.2% compared with 8.4% in 2014. As you know, one of our principal financial goals is to increase our ROE. We are frequently asked about our target ROE and how much we can improve ROE each year. As you can see, we have made a lot of progress over the last few years and we expect an additional 30 to 80 basis points of improvement in 2015. Our goal is to generate an ROE above our cost of equity capital, which, based on the current data and market factors, is about 10.6% today. As you can see on slide 26, our P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds ROEs have been improving nicely. Note that the business ROEs on the slide are unlevered, so we do not include any debt allocation or interest expense. The unlevered P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds ROE has risen from 10.6% in 2013 to 11.2% in 2014 and we project additional improvement in 2015. These levels exceed our current cost of capital of 8.4%, including debt, indicating that we are creating shareholder value in those businesses. The Talcott ROE, however, is much lower and reduces our consolidated ROE to below our cost of capital. However, as you can see on this slide, our one-year data has declined from almost 2 at the beginning of 2013 to about 1.25 today. The reduction in the size and risk of Talcott is the principal reason that the data has declined and is an important contributor to our progress in reducing our cost of capital. Nevertheless, our data remains higher than other P&C companies, which range from 0.6 to 1.15. We have made a great deal of progress in driving ROE growth and reducing our cost of capital. We're optimistic about continuing to make progress with the goal of generating ROEs above our cost of capital. Now I would like to turn to our capital outlook and specifically our views of excess capital in Talcott. As we have stated, we have been evaluating the appropriate capitalization for Talcott taking into consideration its improved risk profile with the sale of Japan. Our previous standard was to maintain a minimum of at least 325% RBC in a stress scenario. We have now updated that to a 200% minimum RBC in a stress scenario. Of course, in more favorable markets the actual RBC levels will be much higher. Slide 27 displays the allocation of Talcott\u2019s $5.6 billion of statutory surplus at December 2014. As you can see, $1.2 billion is allocated to VA, $2.2 billion is allocated to institutional and fixed annuities, and $700 million to other which includes reinsurance credit exposure on divested businesses in our COLI/BOLI book. That leaves $1.5 million of surplus that we consider today to be accessed in the stress scenario, in which we intend to take out of Talcott in stages. Last week, the first dividend of $500 million was paid to the holding company. We expect an additional $500 million in the second half of 2015 and the remaining $500 million in early 2016. Slide 28 shows the capital margin in Talcott under base, stress, and favorable scenarios, the detail of which are in the appendix. All of these scenarios assume we take the $1.5 billion in dividend by early 2016. Assuming the stress scenario occurred in 2015, we estimate remaining capital margin at the end of 2016 of about $400 million, which roughly equates to 240% RBC, comfortably above the 200% level. Slide 29 provides a reconciliation of capital margins in the different scenarios. The VA hedging program helps protect surplus in down markets. In fact, the significant portion of the approximately net $800 million negative impact from VA in the stress scenario results from the reduction of fee income that would result from lower asset levels. Talcott\u2019s major source of capital margin impact in the stress scenario comes from institutional and fixed annuities due to investment related impacts and the impact of interest rates. Finally before turning to your questions, I wanted to summarize our holding company cash flow for 2014 and our outlook for 2015. During 2014, the holding company had about $2.9 billion in positive cash flow, including the Japan sales proceeds. During 2015, we expect dividends of about $1.9 billion. I would note that our projection for P&C dividend is lower in 2015. Having accelerated dividends in 2014, we do not have ordinary P&C dividend capacity until the third quarter of 2015. During 2015 we expect to use approximately $2.6 billion for holding company obligations and the capital management plan, resulting in net holding company cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.8 billion at year-end 2015. This is a very strong base that positions us to deploy capital accretively for shareholders in 2016 and beyond. 2014 was an outstanding year for The Hartford with significant improvement in margins in P&C and Group Benefits, continued net flow improvement in Mutual Funds, and a substantial reduction in risk at Talcott. We are focused on growing core earnings in 2015, offsetting the decline in Talcott earnings with growth in the other businesses. In addition, Talcott is generating excess capital allowing us to deploy capital in more accretive ways to drive ROE improvement. We look forward to updating you on our progress in 2015 to grow both ROE and book value per share to drive shareholder value creation. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for Q&A. And as usual, we would appreciate it if people could limit themselves to one question and a follow-up and then requeue so that others have opportunity to ask the question in the time we have available. Tiffany, could you please give the Q&A instructions Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Thanks. A couple questions here. First, for Doug, just curious with the underlying combined ratio improvement both in personal and commercial, how much of that is going to come from expense initiatives versus loss ratios still improving here given where rates are in line with loss trend? Doug Elliot : Let met tackle the Personal Lines first and then we will come back to Commercial. We still have very consistent approach in Personal Lines and we will be addressing loss trends through pricing in a very similar manner as we are in 2014. So I look at the strategy in 2015 with Personal Lines is very consistent with 2014. On the Commercial Lines side, obviously an evolving environment, and as we talked to you on this call and shared our numbers last night you know that the fourth quarter was down a little bit on the pricing side versus third quarter. So we\u2019re being thoughtful about how 2015 will play out. We\u2019ve got a number of strategies in different places. But much of our improvement is coming, number one, from the fact that our written prices in 2014 will earn their way into 2015. And I would say that much of the expense work we\u2019re doing is being invested back inside the platform. So most of the work and most of what you see inside the combined ratio will be pricing and underwriting driven. Brian Meredith : Okay. And then the second question, just curious on capital management guidance here and you make the comment, the additional $500 million from Talcott, you\u2019re expecting to look to use that for debt paid. I\u2019m just curious, why that decision particularly given that debt capital is incredibly inexpensive right now? Why would you kind of make the decision to kind of continue to pay down your debt? Chris Swift : Hey, Brian. It\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll ask Beth comment too, but I think what we said along is that this two-year plan is the balanced plan of equity and debt. If you look closely at our language, I mean, we have allocated up to billion dollars of debt prepayment this year, half of that is just maturing debt and the other half is what I\u2019ll call, optionality to really look at our debts that continue to drive down. Basically, our debt to cap ratio is as about described. Beth, would you add anything else? Beth Bombara : Yeah. I just had a couple things. First of all, I think you referred to the $500 million dividend from Talcott being the same thing as the $500 million of debt reduction and they're not related, so I would separate the two. As Chris said, we announced our debt management plan last year and you may recall that in the fourth quarter we had anticipated using up to the $500 million to reduce debt and we decided to take a pause because interest rates had decreased at that time and they\u2019re still low. And so we\u2019ll continue over the course of '15 to look at opportunistically what makes sense for us to use that $500 million in a way that we think is in the most benefit to our shareholders. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Your line is open. Randy Binner : Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to touch on -- I\u2019m trying to understand the pace of the runoff and particularly through the trend that we\u2019re seeing in VA surrenders. So that came in, I think, at 11% in the fourth quarter and trended down throughout the year, but the contract count for VA was down about 13% for the year. And so just trying to think about what\u2019s the right way for us to think of how these liabilities runoff, is it more that full year result? Or is it something that could trend down as a single-digit as we look to 2015? Beth Bombara : Thanks, Randy. It\u2019s Beth. So a couple things I would say on that. As you know, we did have some initiatives in 2014, which impacted that VA count coming down, which is why you see the 13%. And as you point out, as we went into the fourth quarter, we did see a reduction. And our estimate for 10% for next year we feel very good about when we look at sort of historical trends and the fact that we don't have a plan in a significant initiative in '15 at this point. So as the year progresses, if we determine that there is something that we would do, we\u2019d obviously update you. But we think right now from all that we can see in our analysis that a 10% is as a good place for us to plan for '15. Randy Binner : Okay. And then this 10% I know initiatives and then on the fixed and institutional blocks, is there any anything initiative-wise or transaction-wise that would make sense there? It seems like maybe the window for transferring those kinds of risks to some institutions is not as open as it was in last couple of years. Any color you can provide on that side? Beth Bombara : Yeah. So I think about it in two pieces that we have our fixed annuity block. And again, the surrender rate or contract decreases that we highlighted for the year were impacted by some of the initiatives that we had in that block and we\u2019ll continue to look to see if that makes sense to do in the future. As it relates to the institutional block as we discussed before, given where rates are at this time we don't really see a transaction for that book to really be economical for us since we\u2019d be basically locking into this very low level. If the interest rate environment changes as we said in the past, we\u2019ll of course look to see if there's something more economical that we could do at that book. Randy Binner : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open. John Nadel : Good morning, everybody. A couple of quick questions for you. So if I think about -- and Beth, I\u2019m glad that you sort of commented on the $500 million from Talcott being above what was already embedded in your two-year capital management plan. So if I could get it the question maybe a little bit differently, I think you're targeting in the holding company cash levels by the end of 2015 at around $1.8 billion. I guess my question is what\u2019s your target longer-term in terms of how much cash you want to keep at the parent on an ongoing basis? Beth Bombara : Sure. Thanks. So when we look at the cash at the holding company, we typically start with looking at what our annual expenditure is for covering holding company obligations, so interest in shareholder dividends, which again you can see on our slide is about $600 million for '15. So we typically talk about a target in sort of the 1.5 times range for that and then of course we always want to have I think a little bit of cushion, but that\u2019s kind of how we look at that. John Nadel : Okay. So it's fair to say, you've got a pretty sizable cushion versus that level? Beth Bombara : Yeah. As I said in my comment, I think ending at $1.8 billion is a very strong position. Again, that doesn't include the $500 million that we anticipate to take out of Talcott in 2016. John Nadel : Yeah. Beth Bombara : That positions us very well as we head into '16. John Nadel : Okay. And then just a bigger picture question, given where rates are and you guys I think are obviously taking that into account in some of your outlook here investment income related and other. But with all the mix shift in the company, particularly the reduction in the risk and size of Talcott? Can you give us an update on how we should think about the longer-term earnings pressure and maybe balance sheet risk from a sustain sort of 2% or sub 2% tenure environment? Beth Bombara : Yeah. So if you think about the projections that we have for year and maybe what I\u2019ll do is, I\u2019ll just talk more about our P&C book. If we look at our outlook right now for \u201915 and if rates sort of remained at current levels and didn't follow the forward curve. For \u201815 we probably see a very modest impact kind of in the $7 million to $10 million range. Obviously, if they stayed there longer and you go into \u201916, you start to see a compounding effect of that. John Nadel : Yeah. Beth Bombara : I think the counterpoint to that though is what would happen on P&C pricing. So there is, obviously, the NII impact, but then there is also just what does that mean for the broader environment, if we were to remain in a low interest rate environment. But that kind of gives you a sense for the P&C portfolio. John Nadel : And then related to Talcott or Group, maybe if anything we should be thinking about, I mean, discount rate on the Group disability side or spread pressures within Talcott? Beth Bombara : Yeah. So, again, if I look at that same measure sort of putting in all in HIG, which would include the Group and Talcott piece. And again, if rates remain flat from kind of where they are now, that $7 million to $10 million impact rises to $16 million-ish. So, again, there is obviously some impact on that. I don't have a breakout between Talcott and Group. And obviously, Group, I would say there again -- there is a pricing dynamic that would also have to be taken into consideration. John Nadel : Okay. That\u2019s really\u2026 Chris Swift : John, its Chris. The only\u2026 John Nadel : Yeah. Chris Swift : Just to offer from a Group Benefits side, I mean, we\u2019ve been discounting reserves for \u201914 and we plan in \u201915 in the 3.5% range. John Nadel : Okay. Chris Swift : So I think our liability structures are already reflecting that lower interest rate environment. John Nadel : Really helpful. So we are looking at maybe 1% earnings pressure from sustained low rates at least for one year. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jay Cohen : Yes. Thank you. Just, I guess, more of a business question. I was interested to hear that you are -- through the AARP relationship going to be selling small commercial business? I am wondering, do you have any sense of what percentage of the Hart members own small businesses, how bigger population are we talking about here? Doug Elliot : Jay, good morning, its Doug. We are aware that there are more than a million members that have small businesses. These -- I would characterize them largely as micro small businesses Jay, employees, less than five. But there is a sizeable component. I think it will take us time to work at that but we are excited about the opportunity and look forward to partnering with AARP and broader ways going forward. Jay Cohen : That\u2019s great. My other questions are answered. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : Thank you. First, I just want to clarify on a previous statement from Beth, that $500 million of flexibility to repurchase additional debt? Did you say that could also go into share buybacks? Beth Bombara : No. I did not say that, what I said was that, we had year marked $500 million and that we would look at through the course of \u201915 when the appropriate time is for us to use that for our debt management. Jay Gelb : Okay. The other point I wanted to come back to is, I believe after second quarter there was some outlook with regard to ROE potentials and previously it was low 9% in 2015 and I believe 30 to 50 basis point expansion in both 2016 and \u201917? So that prior guidance would have gotten you right around 10% in 2016, is that still a reasonable expectation? Chris Swift : Jay, it\u2019s Chris, I\u2019ll ask Beth also to comment. I think some of those comments you are attributing to me. So I still see and buy them, but I would say that, I think, the headwinds were just a little bit more than six, seven months ago honestly, low rates, P&C pricing cycles gotten a little more challenging as Doug and I\u2019ve been saying. So it's not beyond, the realm of possibility, but it is a higher degree of difficulty as we sit here today. And if you really think about it, I -- once we get beyond \u201915, which again, we -- I think given fairly tight guidance, as far as ROE. I think then we are in that 20 to 40 basis point annual improvement from there. So, Beth, would you add any other color? Beth Bombara : No. I think you said it very well. As we talked about before, we had -- we did -- we do expect to see in \u201815 a larger increase than that 20 to 40 that Chris just mentioned, because of the capital management actions that are working in from the sale of Japan, but I think that\u2019s our reasonable expectation. Jay Gelb : Beyond 2015 would you expect the capital management mix to be more weighted towards buybacks as opposed to evenly split in \u201815 between share repurchase and debt pay down? Chris Swift : Jay, if you give us a little time, we\u2019ll talk about that in due course. But right now we are focused on, obviously, executing the plan here in \u201915 and when we get to really developing the \u201816 plan, we\u2019ll give you views. But we've always said balanced, so balance could mean within a range. But also keep in mind sort of debt-to-equity ratios that we want to keep them balanced too. Jay Gelb : Makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open. Erik Bass : Hi. Good morning. Excuse me. And thank you for providing the updated Talcott stat capital breakdown, I guess in addition to the stat capital, do you believe there's a level of redundant reserves at Talcott that could be freed overtime? Beth Bombara : Yeah. So, obviously, there are reserves that we hold on especially in our institutional and fixed book for things that impact interest rates. And so when you look at our margins in favorable scenarios and baselines, you could expect to see some decline there but nothing that we are expecting sort of in any significant manner in the near term. Erik Bass : Okay. And could you provide an update on the present value of the expected earnings from Talcott which I\u2019d think you\u2019d given probably most recently at the end of last year? Beth Bombara : I think you are talking about our MCV analysis, yes. So again where we stand today with the VA book, we would estimate that the MCV is still very positive and about 1.1 billion at the end of December. Erik Bass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Thomas Gallagher : Good morning. Just -- Beth just a few points of clarification. So the new news we are getting here today on the whole capital management plan is the extra funds coming out of Talcott. And just remind me though the \u201814 and \u201815 estimates for buybacks and dividend -- and debt repayment that hasn't changed at all, right. Like so the \u201814, \u201815 total capital return plan, is it same as it was but you're taking more money out of Talcott. And so my question really is if I'm right on that what are those funds being used for, is it just more money sitting at the holding company? Chris Swift : Tom, it\u2019s, Chris let me start, and then Beth could share. I think you got the fact pattern right. So the only new news here is the -- we\u2019ve defined the amount of excess capital in Talcott at the end of 2014. And we plan to take that out basically over the next 12 to 14 months. As we really head into the second half of \u201815, we\u2019ll work on call it what's next related to our capital management program. But I think what we are trying to convey and hopefully you see it, is we will have additional flexibility particularly as the cash comes out of Talcott to think about what is the most accretive use of that capital going forward. But we\u2019ve really haven't pinpoint it saying exactly, what we are going to do. But that's what we are going to work on and communicate it in the second half of \u201815. Beth Bombara : Yeah. And then the only thing I would just add just to be -- perfectly clear is you are correct, we are not making any changes to the plan that we announced in July that we are currently executing on. Thomas Gallagher : Okay that's\u2026 Chris Swift : And just one last point, Tom, do you mind -- and just philosophically, I just want to be crystal clear that there really hasn't been any change in our philosophy, and how we think about excess capital. You\u2019ve heard us say it before and we reiterated here. I mean we are going to continue to be balanced with that in equity, paydowns and repurchases. We still think it's a good use of our capital to buy in shares. We\u2019ll always have an appropriate dividend policy geared towards growing our operating earnings in P&C and Group Benefits. And then we\u2019ve said repeatedly, I mean, we are investing in our capabilities and investing for growth and expansion as we go forward, really with the eye of creating additional revenue streams that create recurring value for shareholders. So that\u2019s how philosophically we were approaching our excess capital. Thomas Gallagher : That makes sense to me, Christy. I guess my follow-up is simply -- of the $1.5 billion plan dividends out of Talcott, it sounds like you\u2019re describing that as the excess capital, that you believe exists in that block. But then it also generates earnings of, I guess roughly $300 million a year. What about the extra $600 million or so of capital that you should get from retained earnings in that block? Should we also expect that, so it would be $2.1 billion all in or is the $1.5 million also contemplate the money that's being earned their? Beth Bombara : Yeah, Tom. It\u2019s Beth. I would think about this way. So again the $1.5 billion, we defined by the valuating the actual tax rate surplus at 12/31/14. And again and showing that we would have adequate resources in a stress. So that $1.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2014, would obviously have taken into consideration any previous earnings that we generated on the book. But you are right as we think about it going forward to the extent a stress doesn\u2019t happen, and each year we generate statutory surplus as we evaluate our statutory position at the end of any given year, we could anticipate that there could be upside to that if we generate the earnings. I would say sitting here today and looking at just a lot of the pluses and the minuses that happen with statutory surplus, I would guide you to think about a range of $200 million to $300 million because it does sometimes bounce around a little bit for variety of items. But again that would be the something we\u2019d evaluate at the end of \u201815, because obviously if a stress doesn\u2019t happen, you have one more year of earnings, one more year of the book running off and then you\u2019d kind of evaluate it from there. Thomas Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Your line is open. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Hartford. Life analyst, I shouldn\u2019t be dominating. Doug, I got a PC question for you. Commercial auto, you said you are raising rates. That's a source of sort of margin improvement in 2015. Where is the sort of underwriting base that you\u2019re operating from a net line and how much are your raising rates? Doug Elliot : Bob, good morning. We\u2019ve been disappointed in our commercial auto performance, primarily in the middle market but also in small commercial as well. This year, back half of the year, our pricing has been in a mid-single to higher single-digit range and I expect that to continue, maybe even strengthen a bit as we move into the early half of 2015, so disappointed. Feel like we have some very strong initiatives, both on the pricing side and also on the underwriting side to address it, looking for progress in \u201915 for sure. Bob Glasspiegel : Okay. And, Beth, just a clarification on your answer to John on sensitivity of Talcott to interest rates here. You\u2019ve talked a little bit about earnings in general terms but how different of a presentation on capital, which you\u2019ve been given if the 10-year was 50 basis point higher where it was at the beginning of the year? Beth Bombara : Yes. So we -- obviously in the scenarios that we show for a stress we are, stressing interest rates in that scenario. And you can see kind of the impact that we see from capital that comes from that. So, I think that as we evaluated the $1.5 billion of access today, I think we appropriately took into consideration additional stress in interest rates. Bob Glasspiegel : So -- I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t quip all the stresses. The current environment is stressing it or its 50 basis points from here which stress it? Beth Bombara : So the stress scenario, as we outlined in the appendix, would have the 10-year at the end of 2016, I believe and like the 1.6 range. So, again, that would have been lower in \u201915, as you go through \u201916. I don\u2019t know if it was exactly the same sensitivity that you are highlighting but that\u2019s how we look at the stress. Bob Glasspiegel : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is open. Ian Gutterman : Hi. Thank you. I guess I wanted to clarify a couple things. First on the P&C dividend, if you are setting off ordinary capacity till Q3, what stops you in Q3 from taking a full year's worth of ordinary dividend, why does it have to be much less in earnings? Beth Bombara : Yes. So the way to think about it is, if you look at the dividend over \u201914 and \u201915, we typically take out about $800 million a year. And so what we did in \u201914 is we just frontloaded on that dividend that we normally would've taken out in \u201915. So over the two years, we kind of get back to our normal level. Ian Gutterman : Okay. But P&C start excess capital at the end of 2014, right. So why couldn\u2019t they take a full year of earnings in \u201915? Beth Bombara : So typically the way we managed the P&C balance sheet and making -- ensuring that we are providing enough capital for the P&C business to continue to invest in its operation. We target annual dividends of $800 million each year. Ian Gutterman : Right. Beth Bombara : And so that\u2019s again how we looked at it. Ian Gutterman : Okay. And then just quickly on Talcott, sort of the stress scenario. Am I remembering correctly? In the past, I think you\u2019ve talked about the Holdco cushion being for the stress scenario. Now that Talcott on its own can handle its own stress scenario, do we need to think of any Holdco capital being held for a stress, or is that really held for something other than a Talcott stress? Beth Bombara : Yes. So as we have said, going all the way back to April of 2013, we see that the capital within the Talcott entity is sufficient to handle a stress. So we are not looking to fund any deficit with holding company cash. And so when we think about the holding company requirements, we tend to focus on the actual obligations for interest and dividend. And then as I said, to have some buffer but obviously much less than what would have been needed in the past. Ian Gutterman : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Frost with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Scott Frost : Hey. Can you hear me, okay? Chris Swift : Yes, we can. Doug Elliot : Yeah. We can, Scott. Scott Frost : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my call. Just to talk about the -- thanks for clarification on the debt management program. This is the same issue announced in mid last year. So, $0.5 billion is potentially available for tenders and over market repurchases that -- just to clarify that's correct, right? Beth Bombara : Yes. That is correct. Scott Frost : Okay. Could you tell us how you think about junior sub, also the Glen Meadows in terms of attractiveness to your capital structure? Does it factor into considerations in terms of ratings? Also agencies have talked about improvement, I think in P&C operations is one catalyst. Is that all -- is it your sense that they also are -- have already taken into account this plan to capital management that you\u2019ve talked about? Beth Bombara : Yes. I will handle the second part first. So, obviously our plan that we have for capital management we share with rating agencies, so they're very aware of what our intentions are and expectation for this plan. As it relates to other resources that we have like Glen Meadows, we obviously look at that as additional capital, that we would have available to us. And as we get -- go through \u201915 and in \u201916, we\u2019ll take a look at what that means for us and how we might use that capital. Scott Frost : Okay. So just to clarify, I mean, your capital management plan, is it something the agencies would have to see you execute before they would act in your sense? And again with your capital position being the way it is, do you need those capital securities really just attractive from a rate perspective and are you sensitive to serve loss on debt extinguishment or is it more of an interest coverage issue that you're working toward? Beth Bombara : It\u2019s kind of probably a little bit of all of the above of what you\u2019ve asked. Scott Frost : Okay. Beth Bombara : First of all, it relates to rating agencies. We have had a record, a track record now for a couple years of laying out a plan and executing on that. We continue to share with them our expectation and all of that is considered as they look at evaluating the ratings of the various entities. And as it relates to just overall debt management, we\u2019re very sensitive to balancing all of those needs. So we are looking at reducing our debt-to-capital ratios as Chris and I have talked about. But we\u2019re also very sensitive to looking at interest coverage and want to make sure that we\u2019re making the right trade-off there. So part of the reason why we held off of a bit on using that $500 million that we've been talking about is we felt the charge that we\u2019d have to take given the current interest rate environment wasn\u2019t a good trade-off. So we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that as we move forward and as rate change. Scott Frost : Okay. Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sabra Purtill. Sabra Purtill : Thank you Tiffany and we\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today and your interest in The Hartford. Please note that Chris and Beth will be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Insurance Conference in New York City on February 11th at 8 AM. We look forward to seeing you there, hopefully with no snow storm. And in the meantime, please feel free to contact either Sean or myself by phone or e-mail if you have any follow-up questions on our financial results and outlook. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Sean. I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford's First Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Head of Investor Relations, Sabra Purtill, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Sean. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to The Hartford's first-quarter 2015 financial results webcast. Our news release, investor financial supplement, first-quarter financial results presentation, and Form 10-Q were all filed yesterday afternoon and they are available on our website. Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. Just a few notes before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure, are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the news release and the financial supplement. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Swift : Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Last night, we reported financial results for the first quarter. Our results show that we\u2019re off to a good start for the year, and that we are managing the increasing challenges in the marketplace. We continued to execute on our strategy and make progress across all of our businesses. Compared to the same period last year, core earnings per share for the first quarter 2015 rose 11%, adjusted for net favorable items in both periods, and book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 3%. In addition, we delivered a 12 month core earnings ROE of 8.1%. Our operating businesses performed well, despite low interest rates in an increasingly competitive pricing environment. Let me share a few highlights from the quarter. In PMC, our combined ratio of 91.7 is essentially flat compared to prior year when adjusted for CATs, prior-year development, and the New York assessments. This is a good result, given the weather conditions, and Doug will discuss more about each line of business in a few moments. In group benefits, core earnings margin increased eight tenths of a point to 5.9%, with outstanding first quarter sales that increased 67%. These results reflect our focus on pricing and underwriting, as well as superior service and claims handling. Our mutual fund businesses generated 28% growth in sales and more than $500 million in positive net flows in the quarter. In addition, we continued to successfully manage the runoff of Talcott, with a $500 million return of capital during the quarter, and year-over-year declines in variable and fixed annuity contract counts. In addition, we are pleased with the upgrades to our ratings from S&P and Moody's, which we received last week. These upgrades represent a notable milestone for us and earn an affirmation of our improved balance sheet, operating performance, and financial flexibility. As we look ahead, we are committed to expanding our capabilities to support our growth. This includes making investments in our technology platform, where we have a number of significant programs in flight. Two of these programs are currently being deployed and are having a very positive impact on our distribution relationships, and the customer experience. First is our new P&C claim system, which continued its rollout across the country. Our colleagues continue to comment on their vastly improved user experience, and how that translates into improved customer experience. With enhanced data collection, we are improving our ability to assign the right expertise to resolve claimant needs in a timely and supportive manner. Second, is our new consolidated underwriting desktop for middle market. We have modernized our underwriting process with this application, delivering immediate benefits in quote turnaround time and communication with our agents. Over time, this platform is the vehicle by which we will deliver new tools and decision support to all our underwriters, which is an exciting step forward. I\u2019m happy about the rollout of these important new technologies and look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the future. One of our strengths at The Hartford is our deep pool of talent. Since our last call, we have made some leadership changes that I wanted to share with you. David Robinson will assume the role of General Counsel when Allan Cresco steps down from the position at the end of May. David has been with us since 2006, and has a broad range of legal and business experiences, including playing a key role in our transformation, and we welcome him to the executive leadership team. I would like to acknowledge and thank Allan for his loyal service to our Company. Few people have played such an influential role in our Company as Allan, who served as General Counsel to three CEO\u2019s. And helped us to manage through difficult times and a successful transformation. We thank him for his countless contributions and wish him all the best. We also appointed Ray Sprague as permanent Head of Personal Lines. Ray joined The Hartford in 1985 and has held leadership positions in both strategy and property and casualty, including running our market-leading small commercial business. Personal lines is an important part of our strategy and we remain committed to improving our performance as we go forward. In closing, I want to reiterate that the first quarter was a good start to 2015. I am confident that we are well-positioned to navigate the more competitive market in a continued low interest rate environment. We will maintain our underwriting and pricing discipline, while also investing in our businesses with a goal of increasing ROE and book value per share to drive shareholder value creation. Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug? Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our property and casualty and group benefits businesses started 2015 with solid results for the first quarter. Retentions continue to be strong, helping to post modest top-line growth. Loss trend in our major lines of business remain benign and within our pricing targets. And in general, our operating performance was very steady, an outcome we are pleased with. We are locked in our core metrics and performance indicators, as we continue to balance margins and growth amid increasing competition. We\u2019re focused on new business risk selection, retention of our best performing accounts, and overall rate adequacy. The marketplace has grown more competitive over the last quarter. We\u2019re beginning to find that there are fewer new business opportunities transacting at our target return levels. We\u2019re also seeing more pressure on our renewals, as the rate adequacy of our book has clearly improved in recent years. We are going to compete aggressively, however, we\u2019re not going to chase business outside of our underwriting and profitability parameters. Our intense operating focus over the last several years, as well as the investments we\u2019ve been making in product, underwriting and technology, position us on a solid foundation to compete effectively under various market dynamics. I\u2019ll share a bit more about this as I recap the first quarter performance for our business units. In commercial lines, we delivered core earnings of $234 million with a combined ratio of 95.9. This was an earnings decrease of $30 million from first quarter 2014, largely driven by last year's one-time expense benefit from changes in New York Workers' Compensation Board assessments. Adjusting for this item, our combined ratio improved four tenths of a point. Renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines was 3% for the quarter. This is actually down about half a point from fourth quarter, although both quarters rounded to 3%. Overall pricing is being buoyed somewhat, by increases in commercial auto. In workers' compensation, improved rate adequacy for the industry has resulted in greater competition, especially in middle market, where our renewal written pricing of 1% was down just over 2 points from fourth quarter. In small commercial, workers' compensation renewal written pricing was 2%, declining by just half a point. Our loss trends in worker\u2019s compensation continued to be favorable, and our returns are within our target range. Catastrophe losses for the first quarter 2015 were very similar to what we experienced a year ago, although storms this year were much heavily concentrated in the north-east than last year's widespread activity. We again saw higher loss activity in commercial lines rather than personal lines, largely attributable to the different geographic concentrations in these businesses. In small commercial, written premium for the quarter grew 5%, with strong policy retention and a slight uptick in new business. The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior-year development, was 89.6, up four tenths of a point versus last year, after adjusting for the New York Assessment benefit. The increase reflects higher expenses as we continue to make investments to improve the customer experience, enhance our products, deploy new technology features, and add local sales representatives. We also saw an increase in agency supplemental compensation costs, driven by improvements in our loss ratio. We remain very pleased with our overall margins in this business and the capabilities we\u2019re bringing to market. Catastrophes hit our small commercial business a bit harder in this quarter versus last year, largely the result of winter storms here in the north-east, where we have a higher concentration of business. As always, our claims response was outstanding and we will continue to evolve our catastrophe modeling and pricing to keep pace with emerging weather patterns. In middle market, we posted another solid quarter, with an underlying combined ratio of 93.7, improving 1.1 points after adjusting for the New York Assessment benefit in 2014. Much of this gain is coming from margin improvement in workers' compensation, as our pricing and underwriting mix actions earn through the book of business. Written premium growth was 3%, as retentions remain steady and new business production benefited from a higher mix of larger accounts. As I mentioned in my opening, we\u2019re seeing a slowdown in our new business pipeline for accounts that meet our underwriting profile. Both the selection of new accounts and the renewal of existing accounts is driven by the talent, portfolio management tools, and data analytics we\u2019ve enhanced in recent years. We will continue to write business when it\u2019s well priced, and exercise the discipline to walk away when it\u2019s not. Middle market commercial auto has been an area that has not met our return targets. In particular, our corrective actions have taken longer to gain traction and show the improvements we expected. Price increases in the quarter were in the high single digits, and we\u2019re continuing to push even harder to achieve a rate adequacy in this line. Within specialty commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 99.1 improved versus prior year, after adjusting for the New York Assessment benefit in 2014. At this combined ratio, the overall business is operating within our target return range, reflecting particularly strong performance in bond and financial products. Favorable prior-year development in financial products contributed to specialty commercials' combined ratio of 94.5. D&O claim trends since the financial crisis have been more favorable than our initial estimates, and we continue to see strong performance in the E&O line. These coverages are becoming an important part of our overall value proposition across all our commercial line business units, and it\u2019s great to have strong results coming from financial products. National accounts continues to perform well, and we\u2019re pleased with the overall profile of this business. We feel comfortable with our retentions and new business hit rates in a very competitive market. In personal lines, core earnings were $75 million for the quarter, down from $101 million last year. The underlying combined ratio of 89.9 deteriorated 1.2 points from last year, largely driven by auto, where we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick in our physical damage severity trends. Total written premium for the quarter grew slightly better than 1%. That included 1% growth in AARP Direct and 23% growth in AARP through agents. We\u2019re pleased with the momentum of the AARP offering through independent agents and we continue to balance growth with overall rate adequacy to ensure that we\u2019re building a strong book of business. On the direct side, we\u2019re adjusting our advertising campaign, and early test results have been positive. Our focus on member value, with the support and insight of the AARP organization, continues to evolve this program and drive its success. In the non-AARP agency channel, written premium was down 7% versus the first quarter of 2014. This is partly due to the highly competitive comparative rate of dynamics of the channel, and partly due to our own underwriting actions. We continue to see opportunity in this channel to grow our business through highly partnered agents. These actions will better position us to align with our best distributor relationships, and deliver competitive products to their customers. Shifting over to group benefits, core earnings for the first quarter were $52 million, up 16% from 2014, delivering a core earnings margin of 5.9%. We continue to see favorable trends in our group life and disability loss ratios versus prior year, although the rate of improvement has slowed. Looking at the top line, fully insured ongoing premium, excluding association-financial institutions, was up 4% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business is in the low 90%s, and we continue to achieve our renewal pricing targets. Fully insured ongoing sales were $300 million for the quarter, a strong start to \u201815, and as I have previously indicated. Approximately 25% of the sales gains are win-backs, customers that left us in recent years, but have now come back. We consistently hear that our service capabilities are a key differentiator and the primary reason clients come back. We\u2019re proud of our Hartford team mates who make that value proposition real every day. And we\u2019re continuing to invest in the tools and technology necessary to meet the needs of our customers. Let me conclude with a few general themes. Across our property and casualty and group benefits businesses, we are well-positioned to compete. We\u2019ve made important investments to improve our capabilities, and taken some hard actions to address shortcomings in our portfolio. Notwithstanding this consistent progress in recent years, there are always pockets where we can and will do better. We will continue to dig deep into our business metrics to effectively manage our performance, retain our best customers, and build value. 2015 is showing signs of greater competition and this is the time for our skill and experience to guide our actions for long-term success. We have a much stronger foundation for the journey ahead. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I am going to briefly cover first quarter results for the other businesses, and then provide an update on the investment portfolio and our capital management activities. Mutual funds core earnings rose 5% in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in fees from higher average assets under management, excluding Talcott variable annuity funds. As expected, Talcott-related AUM continued to run off, which reduced the segment's total AUM compared with a year ago. Fund performance remained solid this quarter, with 70% of funds outperforming their peers over the last 5 years. Our strong performance track record has helped drive strong mutual fund sales, resulting in net positive flows of $529 million. Talcott posted good results this quarter, with core earnings of $111 million, about $20 million above our expectation because of higher investment returns, including limited partnership returns. We model limited partnership income at a 6% annualized return. Assuming that return, Talcott's quarterly core earnings for the balance of the year would be in the $85 million to $90 million range. As Chris mentioned, Talcott's annuity contract counts continue to decline. Our ISV and ESV programs added slightly to the variable and fixed annuity runoff. And we will continue to look at contract holder initiatives and other programs that can help accelerate the decline in these books of business. Since we put Talcott into runoff, variable and fixed annuity contract counts have dropped by almost one-third, down 32% and 29% respectively, since June 30, 2012. During the quarter, Talcott paid a $500 million dividend to the holding company, which contributed to the decline in statutory surplus to $5.1 billion from $5.6 billion. We generated about $63 million of net statutory surplus this quarter, in line with our prior outlook of $200 million to $300 million of surplus generation for the full year. However, low interest rates could provide downward pressure on that estimate as we approached year end. We do not expect this to impact our current intention to take two dividends of $500 million each from Talcott. One in the second half of 2015 and another one again in early 2016. Corporate segment first quarter 2015 core losses were about flat to the prior year. We expect some reduction in interest expense during 2015 as we repay $280 million of maturing debt during the quarter, and also intend to repay another $167 million of scheduled debt maturities later this year. In addition, we will utilize up to $500 million for additional debt management, including the call of our October 2017 debt maturity we recently announced. Turning to investments, the credit performance of our portfolio remains strong, with a modest $15 million of impairments during the quarter. Our portfolio yield also held up reasonably well this quarter, despite the headwinds from low interest rates, with an annualized yield of 4.1%, excluding limited partnerships. In addition, we had more fixed income make-whole premiums this quarter than normal, which added a few basis points to the all-in yield compared with fourth quarter. New money yields remain low, although within the range we expected for the year, which will continue to put pressure on investment income levels. Limited partnership returns, on the other hand, were well above our outlook, with an annualized return of about 14%, consistent with the prior year, but more than double the 6% average we use for planning purposes. This impacted Talcott's results in particular, as I noted earlier. Our private equity and real estate partnerships drove most of this upside, while our hedge fund investments, which are principally global macro funds, had low single-digit annualized returns consistent with our outlook. To wrap up on our results, we had a good quarter, with consolidated core earnings per diluted share up 11%, excluding net favorable items in both periods, such as catastrophes below budget, prior-year development, and the New York Assessments. In addition, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 2% from year end 2014, reflecting net growth in shareholders' equity and the accretive impact of the share repurchase program. Growing book value per share is a key financial goal for The Hartford and an important driver of shareholder value creation over time. A second key financial goal is increasing our core ROE. The 12 month core earnings ROE was 8.1%, a good improvement over the prior year, which included the benefit from several net favorable items. While this remains below our cost of capital, we intend to improve the ROE over time with continued core earnings growth and capital management. The 12 month un-levered ROE for our P&C group benefits and mutual funds businesses was 10.6%. Before turning to Q&A, I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on our capital management plan. As a reminder, the two-year plan initiated in 2014, was $2.775 billion for share repurchases, and $1.2 billion for debt capital management. That plan remains unchanged and through April 24, we have repurchased approximately $2.1 billion of common equity, totaling 57 million shares, for an average purchase price of $36.93. We have $656 million remaining under the equity program, which we will complete over the balance of the year, including a total of approximately $250 million during the second quarter. Under the debt management program, we repaid maturing debt of $200 million in 2014, $289 million in 2015, and expect to repay $167 million in November, which leaves approximately $500 million for other debt capital management. On Friday, we noted the custodian of our intention to call the 4% notes due in October 2017, which have PAR outstanding of $296 million. Including accrued interest and the make-whole premium, this bond call will use approximately $320 million of the remaining $500 million. We expect to use the balance for other debt management actions. As I previously mentioned, during the second half of 2015, we expect Talcott to dividend $500 million to the holding company, and P&C group benefits and mutual funds to also generate about $700 million of dividends. We have made significant strides in reducing debt and improving our balance sheet and risk profile over the past several years, which contributed to the S&P and Moody's upgrades. We expect our capital management plans to include both equity and debt, as we look for opportunities to redeploy excess capital accretively, both as capital management and investment in our businesses. We will continue to execute the current capital management plan, and during the second half of this year, we will update you on our capital management outlook for the remainder of the year and 2016. To summarize, first quarter results were a good start to the year. Our strategy remains unchanged as we remain focused on growing core earnings in our P&C, group benefits, and mutual fund businesses to offset the runoff of Talcott's core earnings. While competitive conditions may be more challenging, the underlying returns in our businesses have improved significantly compared to several years ago, and we are well-positioned, both financially and competitively, to continue to create shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. As I noted earlier, we have about 30 minutes for Q&A. In order to get through the queue and allow everyone to have time to ask their question, we would request that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then re-queue if you have additional questions. Sean, could you please give the Q&A instructions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Michael Nannizzi : Couple questions. Is there any way we could quantify, Doug, the technology investments and higher commissions based on business profitability on 1Q results? Doug Elliot : Mike, we don't share the details to allow you to do that. I would say this, that Chris and I have shared that our technology invest plan over this three year period is a $1 billion-plus plan. That\u2019s putting a little bit more than half of the - about half of the expense pressure, namely inside small commercial, as I called out this morning? Michael Nannizzi : Right. Doug Elliot : And as I mentioned, we obviously are seeing a very solid, profitable run through our loss ratio. So we\u2019re feeling a little expense pressure in our supplementals because we\u2019ve got a three year trigger for loss ratios with many of our agents and brokers. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. Got it. Okay. So I mean, as that continues, then, we could expect to see - I guess we\u2019ll continue to see the expense pressure from supplementals. And then as you work through your technology spend, then we should probably see that normalize at some point? Doug Elliot : Yeah, I would say that. And clearly, as we replace \u201812 with \u201815 - \u201815 starts out in a good spot from a loss ratio standpoint. The three year run with \u201815 will be \u201813, \u201814, \u201815, which will be three good years. \u201815 clearly is in a better place than \u201812 would have been. So I think now we get to a normalized level as we approach \u201815. Christopher Swift : Mike, I would just add on the expense side, we are harvesting gains today. So you should not think that we\u2019re not trying to be efficient today and improve our existing processes, particularly as we spend money on new technology, which will continue. We do capitalize some of those investments that will be amortized over a five to seven year period, depending on the project. But we ultimately expect the payback through increased - I'll call it productivity, reduced unit cost and ultimately, faster growth. So that\u2019s how Doug and I have been thinking about it. Michael Nannizzi : On the upgrades this last week, Beth, thinking about those, where do those fall in your expectation? I mean, clearly, you\u2019re working towards this type of recognition. Is this earlier than you expected? Earlier affirmation than you expected? And does this change in any way how you're thinking about your capital management plan as you start penciling the second half of the year? Thanks. Beth Bombara : Thanks, Mike. So obviously we're very pleased with the actions that both S&P and Moody's have taken. Obviously, over the last several years, we\u2019ve been working with them closely to share with them our plans, and we plan to continue to work for continued improvement. So I don't see it changing our views relative to our capital management plans. Again, it\u2019s nice to get the recognition for the improvements that we have made. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS, your line is open. Brian Meredith : Couple questions here for you. Doug, just curious, on the increase that we saw and some of the severity on the personal auto, would you attribute that to kind of industry what\u2019s going on? Or is anything - any of that related to maybe some selection issues with the big rapid growth you're getting in the AARP agency business? Doug Elliot : We\u2019re looking at every component of that. And we do feel like there are some things happening here that we need to kind of lean into and we have some work programs around. We\u2019re clearly looking at vehicle year and making sure that our new open road product is appropriately pricing those. In the quarter, it looked like our subrogation was a little light. So we\u2019re leaning into subrogation. And as you understand that, that\u2019s something we can catch back up with. So we\u2019ve got a number of things that we\u2019re looking at internally, but we understand there\u2019s probably been a little bit of physical damage pressure across the industry as well. Brian Meredith : Great. And then staying on the P&C topic, I\u2019ll let you keep going here, Doug. Commercial auto. What exactly are the issues with your book that you\u2019re dealing with right now? Seems like some other companies are actually saying they\u2019re finally getting to the right profitability level on commercial auto? Doug Elliot : Yeah, I would start by saying the pressure we\u2019re feeling today in commercial auto is very different than some of the programs and captives we had several years back. So those are in our history, and I feel good about the way we\u2019ve moved away from those programs. This is more organic middle market and to a lesser extent, small pressure just across severity. We\u2019re seeing severity trends in those books of business. We\u2019re pricing for them. We\u2019re looking at vehicle weights against our price per pound. We're looking at driver experience. I would say that we\u2019re leaning probably a little bit more aggressively into driver experience this year than we had in the past. So we\u2019re working across that auto book. We're going to get this book performing much better as soon as possible. And I would say right now, we\u2019re leaving no stone unturned. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino from KBW, your line is open. Vincent DeAugustino : Just a quick follow-up on a previous question on the auto loss cost side. Just with this hitting the physical damage severity side. I\u2019m curious if this is the result of just greater actual damage to vehicles, or if there's any inflation in the repair cost? And the reason I ask here is, if it\u2019s on the actual damage levels to the vehicles, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any type of correlation on the bodily injury side, just maybe to a lesser magnitude? Doug Elliot : Vince, this is Doug again. We are looking at year of vehicle. So obviously, the newer vehicles will have more technology in the bumpers on both sides. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s got our full attention. We obviously feel great about our claim process, but we\u2019re going back. As you know, we have a new claim system that is rolling out as we speak. So we\u2019re looking at the work streams that now revolve around that new system, and looking at similar type and year to make sure we\u2019re on top of all those trends. Vincent DeAugustino : Okay. So your driver base isn't as sensitive to gas prices, but any notable shifts on the frequency side? Doug Elliot : A general up-shift, but not dramatically, we've watched this carefully over the last 10 months, 12 months and so not that I think this is inside our patterns relative to loss at the moment. Vincent DeAugustino : Okay. And if I can squeeze another one on just pricing on the workers' comp side. Workers' comp is a generalization of a lot of smaller micro markets and geographies and injury class codes. I'm curious, based on your comment this morning, within those aggregate numbers, if there are any pockets of really favorable or destructive pricing that you\u2019ve got to watch out for? Doug Elliot : I think you probably have a great sense of the marketplace. In general, there\u2019s been a downward pressure across the filings in workers' comp. So some of the major states are looking at moves in the pricing realm that now are flat to down. I would say, across the middle market, I don't see major swings from the geographic standpoint. I think we\u2019re competing well, I think the tools are in place; the books are very adequately priced. So the improvements we\u2019ve made over the last three years, I think do position a bit more competition, which is what we\u2019re seeing. But we\u2019re going to keep our discipline, and I\u2019m very comfortable that we\u2019re going to be thoughtful as we play this out. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays, your line is open. Jay Gelb : First, on Talcott, I just want to get a bit of a better understanding why you feel the quarterly run rate of earnings would be $85 million to $95 million, given the strong - or much stronger performance was on the first quarter. Was that just all simply due to excess limited partnership income? Beth Bombara : Yeah. That\u2019s exactly what drove the out performance for the quarter. So when we look at just normalizing the run rate for investment income, it gets back down within the range that we previously gave. Jay Gelb : Okay. And then on the capital structure, Beth. I'm looking at page 5 of the supplement. I think this lays it out pretty clearly. Could you remind us where you feel a target range should be for the dollar amount of debt, and also debt to capital? My guess is you\u2019re focused on rating agency adjusted debt to capital? If you could remind us your targets there, that would be helpful for modeling purposes. Beth Bombara : Yes, absolutely. So we do focus on the last line that you see on that schedule, which is the rating agency adjusted debt to capitalization. So ended the quarter at 27.3%. When we look forward to the year and anticipate the debt reduction that I covered in my remarks, all things else being equal, we\u2019d expect that 27.3% to be on a slightly under 25%. And we stated all along, our goal has been marching down to the low 20%s. Jay Gelb : Okay. So even after the Company finishes up its debt reduction for this year, that seems to imply there could be more to come in the years ahead to get that ratio lower? Beth Bombara : Yes. So as we look forward and we think about capital management actions in the future, debt reduction was something we\u2019ll always consider. As we said in the past, we don't need to get to that target immediately. So we intend to continue to be balanced in how we approach that. But obviously, as you do equity repurchases, that also puts pressure on the ratio. So we\u2019re really just looking to balance all of that. And I would call it a steady march down to the low 20%s. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray, your line is open. John Nadel : A question for Doug on the commercial lines side, and maybe it\u2019s sort of wrapping up a couple of the earlier questions, maybe in one maybe easier fashion for us to understand. I think for 2015 you had targeted a combined ratio ex-CATs in prior year between 89.5 and 91.5. 1Q was definitely a bit above that range, but obviously tough weather. But also on the expense side, it sounds like things are going to be a little bit higher. Can you give us a sense - do you still feel good about that range for 2015? Or could this expense component push you modestly above the upper end of that? Doug Elliot : John, I would say that we still feel like that range is achievable. A couple of thoughts. One is, I do think the first quarter on the expense side is a tough compare, because of the one-timers that were achieved last year. But we\u2019re conscious of that, and as Chris said before, we\u2019re driving efficiencies inside this operation. So although we\u2019re driving some of the dollars back inside the invest part of our business, we are looking to become a more streamlined efficient company over time. And I do think, obviously, we\u2019ve got to wait and see how weather plays out second and third quarter. But I look at this as a solid start to the year ,and those targets definitely achievable. John Nadel : Okay. Thank you. Then separately, maybe a question for Beth on the runoff annuity block. The variable annuity surrender rate remains high, although I guess it\u2019s coming down modestly, but can't stay in the 20%s forever, I suppose. But the fixed annuity surrender rate this quarter dropped pretty significantly. Was there any specific thing that happened there? Beth Bombara : Yes. So I will remind you, John, we had a program in place in 2014 that increased that surrender rate, our ISV program. So that obviously impacted those surrender rates that we saw in \u201814 and then going into \u201815. And as I said in my remarks, we will continue to look at ways that we can target specific portions of the book, as we have in the past. And obviously, that can make the surrender rates sort of ebb and flow. John Nadel : Okay. So ex-some sort of modified program, we should expect probably something more in the low to mid single digits on the fixed annuity block? Beth Bombara : Yes. It does tend to bounce around a bit, too. But I think on average, I would say that that would make sense. But quarter-to-quarter, depending on just where various contracts stand relative to choices that they have to make, you can sometimes see the numbers bounce. But on average, I think that\u2019s a good place to be. John Nadel : Okay. Thanks. And then I'm going to sneak one last one in, unless Sabra wants to beat me up. But as we look forward to an updated capital management outlook in the back half of the year, can you just remind us what the ongoing cash needs of the parent company? How much cash do you want to hold back relative to interest expense and dividend payments, etcetera? Beth Bombara : Sure. So as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, when we think about holding company cash and levels that we'd feel comfortable at, we typically target around 1.5 times interest and dividend requirements. And when you look at where we are with interest and dividends, you can think about that as being in like the $650 million range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your line is open. Jay Cohen : A couple of questions. First is, Doug, I think you mentioned that you had planned to adjust your ad campaign for the AARP business. What specifically will you be doing, and how do you think that will affect the revenues? Doug Elliot : What we\u2019ve done in the ad campaign is, we\u2019ve adjusted slightly to be a little bit more value-based, tied in with the AARP membership. So as we\u2019ve made some tweaks over the past 90 days, our response rate has risen positively. And our close rate on those responses also has seen some favorable reactions. So more to come as we work out the rest of 2015, but very encouraged by the early start. Jay Cohen : Great. And then sticking with personal lines, the agency - non-AARP agency business, you had said it\u2019s getting pretty competitive with comparative raters. Was there a change in the quarter, or is this just a gradual continuation of what you\u2019ve seen over the past several years? Christopher Swift : I would say from the industry side, no change that we can tell. We have made some adjustments in our own strategy, really around classes in vehicles and geographies, just normal tuning that goes on day-to-day. And so the combined actions of competitive pressures on our own actions contributed to the quarter. Jay Cohen : Got it. Christopher Swift : Let me just add just a perspective, too, because I called it out, particularly in my prepared remarks, that we are - I mean, personal lines is an important strategy for The Hartford and complementary, obviously, with our strong commercial capabilities. So that\u2019s why we appointed one of our seasoned leaders, Ray Sprague, to really lead this and help us continue to improve it, because we have a wonderful 30-plus year relationship with AARP that we want to continue to leverage and serve their customers. Specifically on your ad question, if you haven't seen them, I\u2019ll get Sabra sent to send you a clip. But they\u2019re really powerful connections - emotional connections, Doug, I would say. They\u2019re strong testimonial-based, hearing directly from AARP members themselves and explaining the value proposition that we offer. As opposed to just competing on price and just a minimum, I'll call it, features and capabilities in the products. So we offer a rich product that we\u2019re proud of from a coverage side. And I think we're going to try to do a better job in explaining why those coverages are needed to insure for the unforeseen. So those are just a couple thoughts I just share with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse, your line is open. Tom Gallagher : I\u2019ll have a question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to [Ryan Tunis] for a follow-up P&C question. Beth, just coming back as a follow-up to what John Nadel asked about on the capital management front. So if I understood your answer correctly, that should leave the full, we\u2019ll call it, $500 million dividend that you expect to get out of Talcott in the back half, plus the $700 million of operating dividends or $1.2 billion. It should leave all of that for incremental capital management or other, over and above your existing capital plan. Is that right, or is it some fraction of the $1.2 billion that would not have been accounted for yet? Beth Bombara : Yes. So the way I would have you think about that, Tom, if you recall, back in February, we provided you with an update on our projections of holding company cash and where we expected the holding company to end the year at. And that was at about $1.8 billion, and that remains unchanged. That took into consideration all the dividends that we just talked about. So when I was answering John's question on the holding company requirements, and if you think about $650 millionish being the annual interest and dividends that the holding company pays, and our target to hold 1.5 times that, I think that gives you a little bit of map as how we think about yearend \u201815. And then again, as we said, going into \u201816, we have the additional $500 million dividend that we anticipate taking out of Talcott as well as just our normal dividends that we would take out of the other businesses. Tom Gallagher : Got you. So that would leave a little under $1 billion, then, if I\u2019m solving - in response to that - with that response in mind, it would leave a little under $1 billion in terms of incremental capital management? Is that the right number to think about? And then obviously, it\u2019s a determination of what do you use for buybacks versus debt management, but is that the right figure? Beth Bombara : Yes. So Tom, I don't really want to get into a specific number. As we said, we are going to look to update our plans in the second half, once we\u2019re going to see how the first half of \u201815 goes and our views of the remainder of \u201815 going into \u201816. There\u2019s nothing hidden in the math that I\u2019m giving you - so you can draw your own conclusion. But again, when we talk about updating our plans, it would be \u201815 through \u201816. Tom Gallagher : Got you. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Ryan on P&C. So I guess my question is \u2013 Doug Elliot : Ryan, let me just follow up on Tom and - I appreciate your reconciliation and trying to pinpoint it. But I think Beth said it well, is that we will get into the second half of \u201815, go through our regular forward-looking planning process, and see the - and just make some final decisions. I think, from my perspective, I take great comfort in the fact that the agencies have seen the improvements that we\u2019re making. We are sitting on excess capital that we intend to deploy in accretive ways. You\u2019ve heard our penchant to keeping things in balance between debt and equity, so I don't think there is anything really changed. And if you could just continue to be just a little patient with us in that we want to be a regular company, and sort of look at these things in a normal cycle and rhythm, and we\u2019ll communicate our views to you at the appropriate time. But thank you for your interest. Tom Gallagher : Thanks, Chris. Tom Gallagher : So yeah, I guess my question on the ongoing businesses, a little bit higher level on personal lines, it\u2019s for either Ray or Doug. But I guess just looking at auto, 7% renewal rate increases this quarter. Should we expect margin improvement in that business this year, given the magnitude of those rate increases? Or would you say those rate increases are necessary just to keep up, based on some of the elevated physical damage severity you mentioned? Thanks Doug Elliot : As we start the year, loss trend is certainly eating into our pricing equation. We hope that that will change. We have got a number of work streams to try to bring incremental margin back inside that book. I would remind you that overall, our auto book is in actually pretty reasonable shape. And clearly, on the AARP side, very solid shape. We have some work to do in the agency channel and we\u2019ve chatted about that in the past. So I hope that we can turn that pricing into a benefit inside the ratio. That\u2019s the goal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bas from Citigroup, your line is open. Erik Bass : Just wanted to touch on the group benefits business. Obviously, it was a very strong quarter for sales and you cited the benefit from the win-backs. Can you also talk about the contribution from new products? And maybe, also, just discuss the competitive trends that you\u2019re seeing in the group benefits market? Doug Elliot : I\u2019ll try to cover a few of those items in the question, which was a good one. Very pleased with the quarter, obviously, a strong sales quarter - our strongest sales quarter in several years. Although I would remind you that we\u2019ve had quarters like that in the past, when this business was really running well for us back in the late 2000s and even into 2010, so pleased with our start to 2015. You can also see that a bit more success has been on the life side. So as we look at the long-term duration contracts in LTD, strong start, but not as strong, probably, as we had seen on the life contract side, so just something in terms of marketplace. Yes, we\u2019re excited about the new product development over the past several years, and we\u2019ve got two new voluntary products in market, including a new disability flex product. We have sold several of those deals. I will also tell you that we\u2018re looking to populate them with employees of the contracts that we\u2019ve written them on, but I think off to a good start. They're recognized by many of our policyholders, and I think we\u2019re going to begin to see that success play out in 2015. So very pleased with our group benefit start. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. And just any comment on the overall competition? I guess when you\u2019ve talked about - your comments around competition picking up generally, it seems it was more related to P&C. But anything similar that you\u2019re seeing on the group benefits side, or is it still a relatively benign environment? Doug Elliot : I would say it\u2019s a relatively consistent environment, so we see competition there. Maybe a bit more on the LTD side than what we had experienced in the past. And again, what\u2019s so interesting about the group benefit world is that, particularly in the national accounts, we\u2019re working six months, nine months in advance. So some of the successes we had in the first quarter were really the result of actions and proposals that went on last summer. But we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to be successful in the middle market. That will be an increasingly important part of our group benefit strategy. But I do think rational competition really across in a consistent manner. Christopher Swift : I would just add a couple of themes that Doug explained. One, if you look at sales, the life TI piece is interesting, so shorter duration versus longer duration. We\u2019re having a little bit more success, particularly in the lower stream environment. Two, it\u2019s obviously a heavy national account season, the 1-1. But equally, there\u2019s a lot of good contribution that Doug and the team have been focused on in middle market in the small side. So our balance of sales is spread amongst the different segments. And then thirdly, the channel, I would say exchanges are beginning to contribute in a way that we anticipated, but is a positive development, too. So we rely on our existing agents and brokers. But there are a number of exchanges that we\u2019re participating in that are contributing nicely to our increase in sales. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR, your line is open. Randy Binner : A lot of good stuff, so mostly answered. But I want to actually jump back to the commercial auto discussion, and then some comments in the opening script, that D&O and E&O claim activity has been favorable. So it\u2019s a reserve question in that the net reserve release in the quarter for commercial lines was relatively flat. And it was relatively flat overall. So the question is was there adverse POID in commercial auto that offset the more favorable D&O and E&O activity, or was there not POID in those items this quarter? Doug Elliot : I think you can see in the sup that, yes, we had some adverse auto liability actions taken on our reserve position, for sure. Mostly middle market, I might comment. And then the financial product good news essentially did offset that. Just a thought about the financial product, D&O, E&O, book. We were heavier in the financial institution block back during the recessionary period, so we made appropriate reserve position judgments back in that period. We've watched them play out as the last five or six years have played out. This quarter, we came to the decision that we had - it was time to make some of those adjustments. So the netting of those two is what\u2019s playing out in our reserve position on the prior, and I think it is well laid out in the sup for you. Randy Binner : Thank you. And then the follow-up is just on thinking of more recent accident years. So if - especially with D&O and E&O, with the economy continuing to be good and loss cost relatively benign, especially in \u201812 and \u201813, there\u2019s been a pricing. Is there an early read you have on some of those - the casualty lines written in those more recent accident years and how they may develop? Christopher Swift : I think it\u2019s too early for us to comment on that. We have a well-balanced book of business across sector, geography, etcetera. But I think it would be early for me to make a call on \u201814 or \u201813. Randy Binner : All right, fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan, your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Many of my questions were actually answered, but on the personal lines side, can you discuss just what\u2019s going on in the non-AARP agency channel premiums? They have been down for a while. Is it competition or are you being more selective in what you\u2019re choosing to underwrite? And then, Beth had mentioned in her remarks on Talcott surplus being sensitive to interest rates. Maybe if you could quantify or give us some color on just how sensitive it would be to make 20 basis points, 30 basis points, 50 basis points of a change in rates? Doug Elliot : I\u2019ll start and take the first half and then we\u2019ll flip to Beth. I would say that with Ray's leadership - and he and I now have been engaged heavily with the group over the past nine months - it\u2019s a great chance for us to do a refresh. We\u2019ve mentioned that we are rolling out a new auto class plan that always encourages tuning, as these things roll into market. So I would consider what we\u2019re doing in the marketplace kind of normal for a competitive product adjustment strategy that we will continue to evolve as we move forward. Yes, it\u2019s a competitive channel, but I think our returns are really in very solid shape. We would like them to be a bit better, but I\u2019m satisfied with where we are and I think we will continue to do tuning as we move forward. Beth Bombara : And Jimmy, on the question on interest rates, I don't have an exact sensitivity that I can give you - a basis point change and what that might mean. What I would tell you is that when we look at the overall book in Talcott, we feel very good about the cash flow generation that we see coming from the VA book. And as we get closer to the end of the year, low rates could just put pressure on that previous range that we gave. But overall, still feel very good about the balance sheet strength and feel very comfortable with the dividend plans that we've put out there. And as we get to the end of \u201815, we will evaluate surplus levels to determine what, if any, additional dividends we would see in 2016, besides what we have already announced. Jimmy Bhullar : And just lastly, is there a minimum level of surplus you would want to leave in Talcott, assuming a normal decline in the size of the block? Beth Bombara : I don't have a specific target in mind. Over time obviously, we focus on RBC ratios. We look at the overall surplus, especially in stress situations and then also balancing liquidity. So again, the plan that we have announced and the dividends that we expect to take out put us well within all of those thresholds that we monitor. And again, as the book gets smaller, we will evaluate absolute surplus levels. Jimmy Bhullar : And those amounts you are comfortable with, even with rates where they are, right? Beth Bombara : Yes. The items that we have already disclosed, we feel very comfortable with. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny, your line is open. Ian Gutterman : I wanted to follow up on Randy's question about the reserves in the recent accident years. Doug, I specifically focused on workers' comp. Obviously, that is your biggest area of reserves. And when I look at the recent accident years, they are reported to incur - the initial reported to incur is so much better than has been historically that I can't draw any other conclusion that you seem to be reserving a lot more conservatively. The only possible exception to that is maybe there has been some meaningful shift in the book, where reports would be coming in later than it used to because of mix or some other underwriting change. Is there anything like that going on? Or should I be encouraged by seeing the early reported to incurred ratios looking so much better than historic? Doug Elliot : First, I am pleased that you are encouraged. We are encouraged by our book profile over the past few years. Not only on the pricing side, but really very pleased about the mix changes and how they've played out inside our earnings and reserve profile. So I think 2013 and 2014 are still early to call, but we are very pleased as to how they look and we hope they continue to look as solid as they are today. But you know, we call them as we see them. We feel good about progress, but these are long tail lines that take awhile to mature. Ian Gutterman : Of course I was thinking more how they play out over time than expecting it this year. But that's okay and then just a follow-up on the agency auto business, then, for you and or Chris. Just strategically and I - you obviously talked a lot about some of the changes you are making, but as sort of Jimmy alluded to, that book shrunk for a long time. And again, I am specifically talking about the non-AARP here. Are the actions you are taking enough that you can compete where you need to at the scale you are at? Or are you going to have to face a decision eventually of either you need to get bigger in then non-AARP business or maybe get out of the non-AARP business? Doug Elliot : Ian, I think you ask very solid questions. As Chris had suggested, we are totally committed to this space. This is been a real solid complement to not only our personal lines agency franchise, but also to the commercial as well. But we have been challenged and we have got to get those hit challenges head on from a financial standpoint. We are doing so as we speak today. I am optimistic about what the next couple years will bring, but I also know that challenge in the channel, based on how competition competes and the comparative rates, etcetera. So I think we will be talking about this as time plays out. And know it has our full attention. And we are on it and we are pulling levers to drive a better financial outcome. Christopher Swift : Ian, I think Doug said it well. But I think when you think about it also strategically, we still believe in advice that the independent agents provide, provided that we have a good competitive home and auto product. So I think when you speak of auto, don't forget about home in making sure that we have a total solution for our independent agents and our customers. So as Doug said it and he said it well. We are committed to figuring this out and how we can continue to add value in this segment. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Sean, we are coming up the hour, so we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Frost from Bank of America Merrill Lynch your line is open. Scott Frost : Without getting into any predictions of ratings - credit rating trajectory, can you give us an idea of where you think your targeted metrics map in terms of NRSRO quantitative ratings? And I have a follow-up. Sabra Purtill : I'm sorry, Scott. The tail end of your question got a little garbled. The metrics relative to -- Scott Frost : Yes. In terms of just the quantitative ratings that NRSROs have out there, you have targeted metrics. Where do you - what do you think they map? Sabra Purtill : Right, like the 22% to 23%, for instance, on the debt to total capital. Beth Bombara : Yes. I would say just slightly higher. Scott Frost : Okay. And can you also remind us a couple things I want to ask about the Glen Meadows and the eight and eight junior subs. What Moody's basket treatment do they get and are they within S&P's equity bucket for you? And how would you characterize the attractiveness of those two instruments in your capital structure? Beth Bombara : For Moody's , it is 25% and for S&P, 100%. The way I think about it, we looked at our debt stack in total in trying to manage to the targets that I said. So those obviously weigh into that as we look at really focusing on the rating agency adjusted targets. So right now, they fit very nicely. And as we continue to manage the debt stack, we really are looking at it more from the perspective of managing to those targets. Scott Frost : So are you saying that both of those instruments are attractive to you now? Beth Bombara : Right now, yes, they are attractive. They do help us achieve the targets that we have. Over time, that could change, but for where we sit today, we do see them as attractive. Operator : There are no further questions. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Sean. We would like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford. If anyone has any remaining questions, please feel free to contact Sean or myself by phone or e-mail and we will be happy to help you. Thank you and have a great day.

My name is Chris, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Hartford second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Good morning and welcome, everyone, to the Hartford second quarter webcast. Our news release investor financial supplement second quarter financial results presentation and 10-Q were all released yesterday afternoon and are posted on our website. Our speakers today include Christopher Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford, Douglas Elliot, President, and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. Just a few notes before Chris begins. Today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings as well as in the news release and financial supplement. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Swift : Thank you, Sabra, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. Last night we reported strong financial and operational performance for the second quarter of 2015, completing a successful first half of the year. We continue to navigate in a dynamic market environment and reported improved results across all of our businesses. Core earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.91, a significant increase compared with the prior year. P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds each delivered better operating margins in top line growth this quarter. This quarter\u2019s strong performance contributed to a 12-month core earnings ROE of 9.6%. The quarter also included net favorable items compared with last year, including higher limited partnership income, lower CATs, a federal tax benefit, lower A&E reserved strengthening and a favorable litigation outcome. Even when adjusting for these items, underlying results were strong. Doug will provide more details on P&C and Group Benefits in a few minutes, but I\u2019d like to share with you a few highlights from the quarter. In P&C, our combined ratio when adjusted for CATs in prior year development was 88.9, a 3.8 improvement over the second quarter of 2014. We are especially pleased to see improved underwriting results in both commercial and personal lines. In group benefits, the results reflect our focus on new business generation in disciplined underwriting. Sales increased 29% and after-tax core earnings margin increased to 6.3%. We continue to successfully manage the runoff of Talcott with year-over-year declines in variable and fixed annuity contract accounts of 12% and 11% respectively since June 2014. In addition to strong earnings, we are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase in the company\u2019s capital management plan and extended it through December 2016. Beth will review the details in a few moments. The plan reflects the successful strategic and financial transformation of the company including a sharpened focus on P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds businesses. Since the beginning of 2014, we have returned to shareholders more than $2.8 billion of capital. With the increase in this plan, we intend to return nearly 5.3 billion in share repurchases income and dividends over the three-year period ending 2016. Our primary focus going forward continues to be on the profitable expansion of P&C, Group Benefits, and Mutual Funds business where is we hold competitive market positions. As you know, we have been investing aggressively in these businesses with the goal of improving operating capabilities. This effort includes a significant upgrade in technology such as our market leading small commercial icon system and the recent introduction of a new claims platform. And we have additional upgrades planned. As we consider management of excess capital in the future, we will prioritize opportunities that accelerate our premium growth and operating capabilities. In the event that we do not find opportunities that meet our strategic and financial objectives, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Looking forward, I am confident that we have the right strategy, capabilities, and people required to successfully compete in a dynamic market environment. The Hartford strategy is focused on four areas. First is product expansion. We continue to expand our products to meet a broader range of policyholder risk needs. We are also participating more deeply in targeted industries and extending our risk selection capabilities. The second is distribution effectiveness. We are actively expanding The Hartford\u2019s commercial line sales and underwriting presence in key geographies, particularly in the west and Midwest. This expansion, supported by enhanced marketing efforts and rigorous sales execution, is driving better outcomes. Third, we continue to improve the customer experience and the operating capabilities of our company through things like process efficiency improvements, technology upgrades, and digital access. And fourth, we continue to invest in talent. We are proud of our employees, and we are working diligently to attract, retain, and develop the best talent in the industry. For example, we recently hired Mo Tooker as our Chief Underwriting Officer for the P&C businesses and added two new executives to compliment the Personal Lines team, Mary Boyd and Casey Campbell. Like the rest of you, we are closely watching developments across the industry including recent M&A activities. These activities certainly have repercussions on our markets. While change brings risk, it also brings opportunity. We are prepared to address and benefit from opportunities that arise, particularly those that fit our primary focus of expanding products, increasing distribution effectiveness, improving the customer experience in our operating capabilities, and becoming a destination for great talent. As I reflect on my first full-year as CEO, I am appreciative of the many contributions that our Hartford\u2019s employees make every day. What makes The Hartford special is our strong character. Throughout the past year, we have received numerous accolades for ethical conduct, risk management, governance, and diversity in inclusion practices, and those attributes are incredibly important us to. In conclusion, we are well positioned to achieve continued success, and we remain focused and our goal of increasing ROE and book value per share to drive shareholder value creation. Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Elliot : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our Property and Casualty and Group Benefits businesses posted strong bottom line results for the second quarter. Favorable property experience for both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses was a significant contributor to earnings. In other lines, our businesses produced solid margins consistent with recent quarters as loss trends remain benign. With the benefit of strong retention, we also delivered solid top line growth. Favorable weather patterns were clearly the primary force behind our outstanding property results. While we have been increasing our property capabilities in recent years and I am confident that our improved acumen and risk selection and analytics is an important driver for our long-term success, we know that quarter to quarter results will be subject to the presence or absence of severe weather. A well-balanced product mix that includes property is a competitive advantage with customers and agents, and we remain steady on our long-term strategic goals in this line of business. Competitive dynamics across all our businesses are largely unchanged from last quarter. As I commented then, adequately priced new business opportunities are more limited, and we remain disciplined in our risk selection approach. We continue to find success in our local relationships with agents and brokers, and we have been investing in sales and underwriting professionals along with our product and technology capabilities to improve our market position. I\u2019ll provide some additional insights on this as I share the second quarter performance of our individual business units. In Commercial Lines, core earnings was $264 million, with a combined ratio of 92.2%. This was an earnings increase of $51 million from second quarter 2014, largely driven by favorable property experience, margin improvement in workers\u2019 compensation, and higher net investment income. Renewal written pricing and standard commercial lines was 3% for the quarter, essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and down two points from second quarter last year. Pricing continues to be strongest in commercial auto where our profit improvement remains a focus. Trends in workers\u2019 compensation pricing are generally in line with first quarter as we execute a very disciplined strategy to retain our best performing business at margins that meet or exceed our return targets. Catastrophe losses for second quarter 2015 were slightly higher than a year ago, but below our expectations. In small Commercial, written premium grew 4% in the quarter driven mainly by strong policy retention as the new business growth rate has slowed somewhat in recent quarters due to competitive forces. The underlying combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year development was an outstanding 85.1%. The decrease of 2 1/2 points versus a year ago is the result of lower non-cap property losses and improved workers\u2019 compensation margins. We\u2019re very pleased with our sustained performance in this business. Our strong written premium growth rate and profit margins have been very resilient as our underwriting and pricing analytics have helped to guide our book up business management actions. In mail market, we posted a strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 89.3%, improving 8.3 points versus second quarter 2014. Much like in small Commercial the improvement is coming primarily from excellent non-cap property experience with contribution from margin improvement and workers\u2019 compensation. A large portion of the favorable property result came from our marine business where we had an excellent second quarter. Written premium growth was 8% driven by strong retention in workers\u2019 compensation and increased new business in both construction and marine. We\u2019re pleased with recent success in these industry targeted businesses as they are a strategic focus for us. This is a positive indication of the traction we\u2019re gaining in the market as a result of talent and product investments made over the last several years. Since earlier this year we have been adding underwriters in regions where we believe we can cultivate agency partnerships and compete effectively for new business. This is a longer term strategy for growth, and it will take time to build momentum in these local markets. However, we believe it is the right time to be investing in talent, to put our improved product and technology platform to even greater use in the market, and develop new books of profitable business. In specialty Commercial the underlying combined ratio was 98.8% versus 101.5% in the prior year. The three main businesses comprising specialty commercial are all operating within our target return range. We posted solid top line growth of 4%, while margin improvement was driven by improved loss experience in financial products and a mixed shift in our results toward bond with a smaller capped business. In personal lines, core earnings was $42 million for the quarter versus last year\u2019s $27 million loss. Much of this improvement is due to favorable catastrophes which are down this year by $64 million pre-tax. In addition, we had significant improvement in our non-catastrophe homeowner losses versus last year when we experienced elevated homeowner fire losses. Comparatively, fire loss this is year were at their lowest level in the last five years, and $11 million of the improvement in core earnings was due to a favorable resolution of outstanding litigation. The underlying combined ratio of 89.1% improved two points from last year, largely driven by the homeowner results I just described, partially offset by a slight uptick in auto liability severity. In addition, we\u2019ve been closely monitoring increased auto physical damage severity, having begun to see adverse trends several quarters ago. Industry trends in early 2015 also appeared to be somewhat elevated. We have identified several opportunities for improvement to our physical damage claim practices and have taken action. Our early observations from these initiatives indicate that we\u2019re driving improved outcomes, particularly in areas such as subrogation and total loss management. Total written premium for the quarter grew 1%, including 1% growth in ARP direct and 14% growth in ARP agency. We continue to be encouraged by the growth and solid margins of our AARP business. On the direct side, new business increased by 4%. In other agency, written premium was down 9% versus second quarter 2014. We\u2019re aligning ourselves with highly partnered agents who seek to deliver competitive yet value-based products and services to their customers. As we move in this direction, there\u2019ll be some agents and customers that do not match our profile and may seek other options. Shifting over to Group Benefits, core earnings in the second quarter was 56 million, up 8% over prior year, achieving a core earnings margin of 6.3%. The increase is primarily attributable to top line growth and a lower expense ratio compared to prior year. Earn premiums excluding association, financial institutions was up 5% in the quarter, driven by growth in our employer group life and disability lines. For the quarter, fully insured ongoing sales of 58 million, up 13 million from prior year, as we continue to have success marketing our differentiated service offering. In addition, our employer group business continues to maintain strong book persistency around 90% on an annualized basis. The overall loss ratio was essentially flat to prior year. Improvement in the Group disability loss ratio was largely offset by less favorable mortality in group life, which looks to be a function of normal volatility in the line. This is another excellent quarter for Group Benefits. Markets remain competitive and we\u2019re performing well in all assets of our business. We are well positioned with strong book persistency and improved capabilities, allowing us to compete for new accounts. And we\u2019re executing on plan initiatives for our voluntary platform, further enhancing our value proposition. With that, let me conclude my comments by reiterating that we had a strong second quarter. We enjoy favorable results from catastrophe and non-catastrophe property losses, and the performance of other lines of business remain strong. Across our Property and Casualty and Group Benefit businesses, we have strengthened our products, technology, and talent. Over the last six months we have attracted a number of experienced industry leaders to our team who will help drive our near-term execution and our long-term strategic objectives. We are confident that the business platform we\u2019ve been building in recent years will serve us well as we balance growth and profitability for the long term. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to briefly cover results for the other segments and investments, and will then review our updated capital management plan. In addition to Commercial and personal lines, P&C includes the P&C other operation segment, which has a block of runoff liabilities, including asbestos and environmental. Core losses in this segment were 113 million in the quarter, down from losses of 146 million in the second quarter of 2014, due to lower reserve strengthening on our A&E reserves. As many of you know, we complete the annual ground-up A&E reserve study in the second quarter. As a result of this year\u2019s study on a pre-tax basis, we strengthened our net reserves by 146 million for asbestos and by 52 million for environmental or a total of 198 million. This is down from 2014 when we had net reserve strengthening of 239 million, comprised of 212 million for asbestos and 27 million for environmental. The asbestos reserve strengthening reflects lower than projected improvement in new mesothelioma claims for a handful of our peripheral accounts, less than 20 out of more than 1,100. The remainder of the accounts are trending in line with the assumptions used to set our reserves. The environmental reserve strengthening was driven by higher new claim severity, including at a handful of super-fund sites but frequency has declined. We are often asked why we haven\u2019t done an A&E reinsurance deal. We evaluate options for A&E periodically, but to date these deals have not been cost effective, taking into account many factors, including the value we add by continuing to manage these claims ourselves, the price charged by potential reinsurers, the lack of a full assumption reinsurance or sale option, and the potential loss of investment income. Last year investment income in the P&C other segment totaled 129 million before tax. Notwithstanding another year of adverse development on the A&E book, we believe that we can create a better outcome for shareholders if we continue to manage this book ourselves. We will, of course, continue to consider alternatives for these exposures as options and costs could change. Turning to the financial results of our other segments, Mutual Funds core earnings rose 5% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher fee income on increased average assets under management, excluding Talcott variable annuity funds. As expected, Talcott-related AUM continue to run off, which reduced the segment\u2019s total AUM over the past year. Fund performance remains solid this quarter, with 69% of funds outperforming peers over the last five years, helping to improve net flows to a positive 250 million in the quarter. For the first half of 2015, net positive flows totaled 779 million, the strongest net flow performance since 2010. Talcott posted very strong core earnings of 171 million this quarter, well above our expectations because of a 48 million federal tax benefit and higher investment income, largely from very good returns on limited partnerships. Driven by private equity and real estate funds, limited partnership returns have been very strong this year, running at more than double the rate we used in our February outlook. Talcott\u2019s annuity contract counts continue to decline. Our ISB program added slightly to the fixed annuity runoff, while variable annuity runoff was a more normal level since we did not have a surrender focused contract holder initiative this quarter. We continue to evaluate contract holder initiatives and other programs that can help decelerate the decline in these books of business. In July, Talcott paid the second 500 million dividend of the year, bringing the total to 1 billion. We expect another 500 million in early 2016. Corporate segment second quarter 2015 core losses declined compared with the prior year and with the first quarter largely due to lower interest expense as a result of debt repayments. We expect interest expense to decrease in the second half, due to the second quarter bond call and the fourth quarter 167 million debt maturity. For the full-year, interest expense excluding the impact of any debt tenders or repurchases is expected to be about 357 million, down 5% from 2014. Turning to investments, the credit performance of our portfolio remains strong with a modest 11 million of impairments during the quarter. Our annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4.1%, and continues to hold up reasonably well despite the headwinds from low interest rates. New money yields remain low, although within the range we expected for the year, which will continue to put downward pressure on investment income and yields as higher yielding investments mature and are reinvested at lower returns. Helping offset this somewhat, similar to the first quarter, we had higher levels of income from fixed income make whole premiums and other non-routine items, and also from limited partnerships whose annualized yield was about 13% in the quarter. To wrap up on our results, we had a strong quarter with consolidated core earnings per diluted share up significantly and a 12-month roll-in core earnings ROE of 9.6%, both reflecting lower caps, strong limited partnership income, a few favorable tax and other items, partially offset by unfavorable prior year development. Excluding net unfavorable items from both periods, core earnings per diluted share was up 66% over second quarter 2014. In addition, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, also rose up 4% from year end 2014 and 8% from June 30th, 2014. Reflecting net growth in shareholders equity excluding AOCI and the accretive impact of the equity repurchase program. Outstanding and diluted shares have decreased by 9% since June 30, 2014 as a result of the equity repurchase program. Before turning to Q&A, I\u2019d like to wrap up by reviewing our capital management plan. As announced last night, the equity repurchase authorization was increased by 1.6 billion and extended through year end 2016. This provides us a slightly more than 2 billion of equity repurchase authorization for the balance of 2015 and 2016. We currently expect to use this amount ratably over the period subject to market conditions and other factors. Yesterday\u2019s increase brings the total equity repurchase authorization to nearly 4.4 billion for 2014 through 2016. Debt reduction remains part of our capital management plan, as we strive to reduce our rating agency adjusted debt to total capital ratio to the low 20\u2019s, over time. Yesterday, we announced that we intend to repay the 2016 debt maturity of 275 million. As previously stated, we intend to repay the 167 million issue that matures in November of this year. In addition, we have 180 million remaining under the current debt management plan, which was extended through December 31, 2016. When and how we will utilize that portion will depend on various factors, including market conditions. The increase in the capital management plan will be funded by current holding company funds, as well as future dividends from the operating subsidiaries and other sources. During July, we have received about 900 million in dividends for the holding company, including 500 million funded by Talcott. For the remainder of the year, we expect approximately 300 million in dividends from subsidiaries for a total of about 1.9 billion for the year, unchanged from our February projections. In 2016, our current outlook is for about 1.9 billion of subsidiary dividends and other cash flows to the holding company, including 800 million in dividends from the P&C companies. Finally, recognizing the strong improvement in our P&C group benefits and Mutual Funds earnings, the board authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.21 a share, effective with the October dividend payment. Including the impact of share repurchases, we expect to pay dividends of about 330 million over the next 12 months, or about 30% of trailing 12-months consolidated net income, excluding Talcott. Combined with our equity repurchase plan, we are clearly delivering a substantial amount of excess capital back to shareholders. As Chris discussed, with our strategic and financial transformation largely complete, our priority for excess capital utilization going forward is to find opportunities to invest in our businesses, helping to drive premium and earnings growth and expand our capabilities. We will continue to evaluate capital management options as it remains a good tool that we can use to return excess capital to shareholders in the event that we do not find opportunities that meet our overall objectives. I will call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Before beginning the Q&A session, I would like to remind you all that consistent with past practice and company policy, we do not comment on market rumors or speculation. We appreciate your keeping that in mind so the Q&A session can be productive for everyone on the call. Chris, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? Operator : I certainly can. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you. Beth, just wanted to sort of go back just a comment that you made there. So for 2016 you said the current outlook is 1.9 billion in dividends including 800 million from the sub. So am I missing something? Where is the other 1.8 billion coming from? Beth Bombara : Sure, Mike. So, as you recall, I mentioned that we do anticipate getting $500 million of dividends from Talcott in early 2016. Michael Nannizzi : Yup. Beth Bombara : So that would be included. And we also expect dividends from Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. And similar to this past year, we would expect to have favorable tax receipts at the holding company as well. And all of that comprises the 1.9 billion that I mentioned. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. That\u2019s great. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Doug, can you break out-- is it possible to break out the margin improvement that we saw in both small commercial and Middle Markets. It can from either the favorable [indiscernible] weather or underlying margin improvement related to comp? Douglas Elliot : Mike, let me try to give you a little bit of color. You\u2019re right. It was a very good Property quarter and workers\u2019 comp too. It was about four points in Middle Market and a little bit less than that in small commercial and just in terms of the margin improvement in that line of business. Michael Nannizzi : Okay, so those points you mentioned are related to the property and the remainder would then be related to workers\u2019 comp? Douglas Elliot : Those are the two line drivers, yes. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. Okay. And then in homeowners, would it be possible to quantify the - or just give us some marker around the impact of the favorable fire losses on the underlying? Douglas Elliot : I can do that. You obviously get the CAT numbers and you can see that the CATs are down Q to Q seven points from last year. The fire losses, as I mentioned, were down to the lowest level in the last five years. I think we\u2019re about five to seven points less than the higher years during that five year period. So I would use as a gauge inside our non-CAT property element. Michael Nannizzi : Okay, got it. Great. And then the last question, I guess, on the other agency business, obviously premiums there is have declined. I\u2019m guessing that that\u2019s because of maybe not acceptable levels of profitability. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what\u2019s happening there in terms of your profitability? And what actions you are taking and seems like the prudent thing to do, but just to get an idea where that is relative to your AARP business, for example. Thanks. Douglas Elliot : Sure. Mike, a few things, one is, and we\u2019re working all angles of this. We\u2019re working on tuning our open road product which is our new auto class plan, so those tuning requirements continue throughout the country. We are investing and working hard on our homeowner\u2019s product, probably a little bit more going forward than over the last three to four years. We think Homeowners is an important line relative to our personalized strategy, so a lot of work going on in homeowners. Clearly challenged in the agency space thinking about how we compete and looking for partners that are willing to work with us, work on a value prop play. We have been tuning that segment and will continue to tune. We do feel good about progress. Very pleased with our overall return efforts, but also want to see if we can get the top line moving in a little bit more positive direction. Michael Nannizzi : Great. Thanks so much. Douglas Elliot : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. John Nadel : Hi. Good morning everybody. Doug, maybe just a quick follow-up. I understand the following up on Mike\u2019s question about the favorable weather and the impact that that had. Can you just sort of characterize that for the commercial segment overall as well as for the personal line segment overall? Significant accident year-loss ratio improvement, but just wondering what you think the actual underlying sustainable level of improvement really is. Recognizing, you know, each quarter can be somewhat volatile. Douglas Elliot : Yeah, John, the underlying in small, again, really across all our commercial businesses on property was probably several points less than sustainable. That doesn\u2019t mean that we haven\u2019t seen improvement, but I would say two to three points. When I look at our spectrum product in small commercial, a couple of points under where we have been the last second quarters of prior years, and really the key property business has performed pretty consistently the last couple of years. So at consistent levels but at solid levels. I like our loss performance, I think both [indiscernible] and CAT are in very good shape, but probably a couple of points better than a run rate perspective. John Nadel : Got it. Okay. That is really helpful, thanks. And then maybe a question for you, Chris. I appreciate certainly the improvement that we have seen in the underlying fundamentals, the improvement in the balance sheet, etc., and the commentary about seeking opportunities to accelerate growth. I\u2019m curious because it still appears that there\u2019s a reasonable amount of financial flexibility and conservatism in your updated capital outlook. And so the question for you is this, do you think really buybacks versus potential acquisitions to accelerate growth have to be a mutually exclusive concept, or do you believe you have the capacity to pursue both? Christopher Swift : John, thanks for the question. I wouldn\u2019t exclude one or the other at this point. I think you have seen our history and track record, particularly working to improve our financial position and deliver the firm, and obviously reward shareholders with accretive capital management. So the way we think about is we announced a plan through 2016. That is our intention. It is our highest and best use of excess capital, but I think what we were trying to signal is a little bit of an inflection point because we feel we\u2019re in a different place. We\u2019re in a different company today. And we can be a little bit more offensive minded about opportunities in the marketplace. John Nadel : Totally appreciate that. And I guess just a quick follow-up along those lines, Chris. Any specific areas within P&C or even on the Group insurance side that you feel like are areas where you want to expand, where you want to be able to find that faster pace of growth, where you maybe lack some scale today? Christopher Swift : John, I think we think about opportunities across all our businesses. I mean, you mentioned a couple, but in Commercial, you really think about two main themes. If you\u2019ve heard Doug and I and Beth continually talking about adding product and underwriting capabilities to the platform, being a deeper and broader risk player. That\u2019s really what we mean in growing our future capabilities and industry verticals. So we think of specialty in that area. We think, in terms of larger parts of the U.S. economy, maybe we haven\u2019t participated as deeply as I think we can or should. John Nadel : Okay. Christopher Swift : You referenced and you heard Doug talk about marine construction, real estate, infrastructure related. Those are the types of things we talk about as far as the real economy and expanding. And along with our geographic penetration and focus. So, anything along those lines, in Commercial, would be very intriguing to us. And you mentioned Group Benefits. If I really look at our platform, I would say we gear it more towards a national or large account platform. Very balanced LTD, STD and Life business. About 50% of premiums in each of those categories. So, if there were opportunities in the small and medium case segments, and folks that potentially could accelerate the pace of our voluntary sales growth, those are the things we would think about there. John Nadel : Okay. Christopher Swift : And then, lastly, in Personal Lines. Look, we don\u2019t aspire to be a broad market player, but we think we have unique skills and capabilities in direct marketing, in sort of those niche areas. And we think in those terms, John, if there were opportunities to use our brand and direct marketing skills in our wonderful claim skills. So that\u2019s just to give you a little bit more of a flavor. John Nadel : I really appreciate the color. Thanks very much, Chris. Christopher Swift : John, just a last point there. I think in all of this and, hopefully, you of all people know, and others, is that we continue to be very thoughtful. I would say disciplined and deliberate in this area. Just knowing where we\u2019re coming from and how we want to use shareholders\u2019 capital in the most prudent fashion, going forward. But we did signal a change this quarter. John Nadel : Yeah, no question, Chris. I have a lot of confidence. So, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Good morning. Two quick questions I think for Doug. One, within the overall 3% standard commercial rate increases, is there a difference between the property and liability lines? Douglas Elliot : Meyer, all the lines do have their own nuances to them. As I mentioned, Auto is right now achieving more rate across Commercial than other lines. So that\u2019s the lead line. Workers\u2019 compensation has been a bit more under pressure over the last couple of quarters. And even between small and middle, there are nuances. So, yes, very different dynamics across the lines. But, in general, pleased we still see rational competition. Maybe a bit more pressure, but I am very pleased about what we put up this second quarter, and feel good about our efforts first half of the year. Meyer Shields : Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the adverse developments in Commercial, besides the asbestos environmental, in terms of what was going on there? Beth Bombara : I will take that. This is Beth. We had very modest adverse development, excluding A&E. We had some favorable development in our workers\u2019 comp lines, which is offset a little bit by unfavorable development as it relates to the discount on workers\u2019 comp reserve, which reflects the fact that as we\u2019ve been settling claims at a faster pace, the amount of actual discount that you have in the reserve changes. And then, the other aspects were really just small puts and takes across the various lines. Really nothing that is worthy of calling out. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yeah, good morning, Chris. I\u2019m just wondering, can you talk a little more about, when you are evaluating financial acquisitions, kind of the financial benchmarks that you are going to be looking at? Be it, IRR\u2019s, return invested capital, how it relates to share buyback and those types of things? Tangible book value, dilution. Christopher Swift : Brian, yeah, happy to. I think, a couple points. One, first, any acquisition opportunity first needs to be strategic and financially compelling to make sense. I think, second, we also think about it when we talk internally of the comparison to building organically, because largely what we have been doing is an organic focus. So an acquisition needs to be weighed generally in terms with an organic build. And those organic builds require an investment, requires timelines, obviously patience because it won\u2019t happen overnight. So, you sort of weigh all that to sort of see would an acquisition opportunity really accelerate our growth and make sense. I think also, too, really since our transformation, we really driven down our cost of equity capital, reduced our leverage, improved our valuation. So, I think today we have greater flexibility to think about acquisitions. And, ultimately, we view it as a ROI or IOR type of analysis where it needs to add value over a longer period of time and exceed our cost of equity capital today or else we won\u2019t do it. And I think from there then the historical metrics of EPS and book value per share will emerge in the accounting records that I think then will create value over a longer period of time for shareholders. So, as I said to John, we continue to be very thoughtful, disciplined, and deliberate in this area. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking. Brian Meredith : And do you relate it all to share buyback and thoughts on return, share buyback versus M&A, organic growth? Christopher Swift : It\u2019s part of the overall equation, but, again, from a strategic side when we\u2019re trying to grow our capabilities and grow our earnings, that also needs to be weighed in because by itself, share buybacks don\u2019t increase the nominal dollars of earnings going forward. So, but we do weigh that all very carefully, Brian. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up for Doug. The investment spend that you\u2019ve been doing the last couple of years, system build-out (audio breaks up), those types of things, where do we stand in that kind of process as far as expenses, and how much longer do you think it\u2019s going to be a drag on the expense ratio? Douglas Elliot : Brian, when I think about our invest, I think about it over a longer period of time. So, I don\u2019t think about it in spurts of quarters. This is a long-term process. I know we shared quite a bit of that progress in Charlotte with the investor day in June. We\u2019ve got some of those invests going on in Middle. Yes, a little bit of pressure on the expense ratio, but I look back at where we are in kind of our quarterly expense and our annual expense targets, and I think about what\u2019s happening through the bottom line in our margins. I\u2019m comfortable with those invests, and actually see them over a longer period of time than I do over just 2015 or 2016. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Christopher Swift : Brian, it\u2019s Chris. I think just another thing you need to think in terms of is, and I\u2019m not sure where the industry stands in totality. All I can speak from is our company, but we really do need to modernize our tools, capabilities, infrastructure, digital content, and as Doug said, this isn\u2019t a simple one and done over the next 12 to 18 months here. This is a commitment to fundamentally improve our customer facing, exchanges, interfaces, for the long term. So we\u2019re going to be disciplined about expense management, but on the invest side we\u2019re over clubbing to really improve our capabilities in this area. So, I think we are balancing the best way we can in this dynamics, but make no mistake about it, we\u2019re committed to fundamentally improving our infrastructure and capabilities to improve our customer experiences. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Erik Bass of Citigroup. Your line is open. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. In Group Benefits you continue to have nice growth momentum. So, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the competitive dynamics in the market and how much of your growth is coming from new products and your expanded voluntary product set. Douglas Elliot : Erik, hi, this is Doug. A couple of thoughts about it. Really we had a terrific start to 2015, so we\u2019re encouraged about that progress and really feel like we have priced our way through the challenges of two or three years ago, so that is in the rear-view mirror. As I look ahead, there are strong competitors around us, but I feel good about our ability to earn our way into the finals, and we\u2019ve won our share. Inside our new sales, there\u2019s a positive story both on new customer, but there also is a positive story on growing inside our current customers with at issue sales in addition to where we were last year with that current customer. So that\u2019s point number two. And then lastly, voluntary has been an important part of our strategic grow these last couple of years, particularly just getting the product ready to meet the street. I think we feel good that we were able to work those 11-15 and now into 15 with the accounts with our abilities in the voluntary area. It is slow, it\u2019s probably a little slower than Chris and I thought it might be. As we finish the year, our sales probably in the voluntary area will be just in the GAAP product area probably under 10 million for the year, but what\u2019s important is that we\u2019re able to be at the table with customers that demand that as part of their suite. And I think we\u2019re there today, and a couple of years ago I was not able to say that. Erik Bass : Thank you. And then just a quick one for Beth. You mentioned that you still expect to pay a 500 million dividend from Talcott in early 2016, which I believe in the past you\u2019ve said doesn\u2019t include 2015 statutory earnings. So, given the pretty strong results you\u2019ve seen in Talcott so far in 2015, is there a potential to take either an upsized dividend or an additional dividend from Talcott in 2016? Beth Bombara : Yes, so that is correct. I have only included the 500 million that we\u2019ve previously talked about. As it relates to 2015, I think what we\u2019ve always said is we want to see how 2015 year actually ends. Through six months in June, Talcott first rate [ph] surplus is actually relatively flat once you adjust for dividends, and so what we really need to see is where we end the year. Right now we would anticipate that we would generate statutory surplus still in that 200 to 300 range, but as we said previously, kind of at the lower end of that range. But it really is going to be a function of just where interest rates land at the end of the year and how that potentially impacts reserves that we have to set. So until we end the year, we\u2019ll evaluate where the statutory surplus is and there could then be potential, but we\u2019re not putting that into our projections at this point. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Chris, just to start out, I just want to get a sense for the way you\u2019re thinking about potential M&A. Would you contemplate transformative M&A, or are we talking about more modest opportunities as ways of deploying excess capital? Christopher Swift : Tom, thanks. I would say I think our current thinking right now is more modest, adding to capabilities and product lines. And I made a point to be clear, we\u2019re a U.S.-focused company and organization right now. So, I assume if you were talking about transformative, you were thinking maybe beyond our borders, but our intent is I think we have opportunities to capture more market share with expanded products and capabilities in our U.S. territories. But also be sensitive to maybe following U.S. customers abroad with some of their skills. But we don\u2019t think about building international local market expansion currently. Tom Gallagher : Okay. That is helpful. And then I just want to be clear here that the current buyback authorization, is that going to be competing with M&A when you contemplate what you\u2019ve announced so far? So in other words if you found attractive deals that could consume some of the buybacks or do you have additional resources or excess capital that\u2019s actually slotted for M&A? Christopher Swift : Tom, it\u2019s a balancing act. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s competing. That\u2019s our plan, that is our intention, that\u2019s what we think is the highest and best use. And if there\u2019s alternatives that come along, we\u2019ll put that as far as the overall equation. But I think you know myself and Beth, we are appropriately prudent in managing the balance sheet and always have flexibility in mind. Tom Gallagher : Okay. And I guess either Chris or Beth, just to be clear, though, your current capital plan doesn\u2019t necessarily allocate some additional capital buffer for M&A, or am I - can you comment on that at all whether there\u2019s something in that plan through 2016 that is allocating something that you\u2019re now holding on to for M&A or anyway can you comment on that? Christopher Swift : Yeah, Tom, and Beth can add her point of view. Again, how we think about it and maybe others have talked about it, too, is we said the deal needs to be strategic and make financial sense. And if we find something that from an acquisition side hits those hurdles and makes our ROI\u2019s work, we\u2019ll figure out how to finance it. And so I said earlier, we\u2019ve reduced our leverage and will continue to reduce it, but we do have flexibility to figure out how we would, I\u2019ll call it fund or finance a deal, if we found the right one. So that\u2019s all I would say at this point. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Randy Binner : Thanks. You all discussed the A&E resolution market a little bit in your comments. Do you have any update on the annuity risk transfer market? From our perspective, it seems active. And so would be interested in any update you have on that market or should we think of Talcott as continuing to be internally managed resolution? Christopher Swift : Randy, it\u2019s Chris. Beth can add her point of view also, but I think right now we\u2019re very pleased sort of with the runoff in total of Talcott. And particularly the capital that we\u2019ve taken out. I remind you we\u2019ve take a billion out this year and we plan as Beth said to take 500 million out in early 2016. So we understand the risk. It\u2019s well managed. It\u2019s well contained from our perspective. And as Beth might comment upon, we do really believe in this low interest rate environment. That does depress valuation. So these are all the things that we consider in sort of a transact versus a continued runoff mode. But Beth, what would you add? Beth Bombara : Yeah, I think, Chris, as always, I think you\u2019ve captured it very well. Christopher Swift : Yeah. Beth Bombara : I think it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. And we are always open to the consideration of transactions, but at the end of the day, needs to make economic sense for us and where we sit today with the capital that we\u2019re able to extract. And as Chris said, to manage the risk in that book, we feel very comfortable. But of course, we\u2019ll always be open to other considerations as markets change. Randy Binner : Great. And then the follow-up there is just on the withdrawals, which in the kind of the 12%, 11% year-over-year basis is good. And I think that\u2019s kind of as some of your programs that increase surrenders are winding down. Do you have any plans to kind of continue to push new programs there to continue to accelerate the wind down of those liabilities? Beth Bombara : Yes, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019ll always consider other policyholder type initiatives that could further reduce the exposure and that book of business. We\u2019ve been very pleased with those that we\u2019ve had in the past. As I\u2019ve said pretty consistently is our thought process is to really be very targeted as we look at those initiatives. So we don\u2019t have one right now in place. There is a team that consistently evaluates those to see if there\u2019s something that could be done. But overall when we look at the continued reduction in the contract counts, we feel very good with the activity we\u2019re seeing. Randy Binner : And those have been well received, those plans by agents and clients? There\u2019s been no real push back, is right? Beth Bombara : Yeah, I mean, I think the results speak for themselves and what we\u2019ve been able to achieve with those programs. Again, we\u2019ve always said they\u2019re not right for everyone, and that\u2019s why policyholders have a choice. But as we said, we\u2019ve been pleased with the results that we\u2019ve been able to achieve on both the programs we\u2019ve had in the variable annuity and the fixed annuity space. Randy Binner : All right. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Scott Frost with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Scott Frost : Okay, thank you. From the debt side, appreciate the clarity in communicating your debt management goals. Thank you for that. But wanted to talk briefly about your junior sub issues as you may have expected. It\u2019s topical in our world. First, with respect to the 8 and 8\u2019s and then to the Glenn Meadows, how would you characterize the efficiency of each of these instruments in your capital stack? And I have a brief follow-up. Beth Bombara : Okay. Thanks for the question. So again, as we\u2019ve been talking about in the past, we are focused on reducing our overall rating agency adjusted debt to capitalization ratios, also focused on things like coverage rates and so forth. And so we really look at our capital, our debt structure sort of across the spectrum. And today as we sit here, I think that the eight teams do provide us benefit in that we do get equity credit as we look at managing that ratio. And overtime we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the debt stack, keeping all those factors in mind, but no change in our views as to how we think about those. Scott Frost : Okay. And just specifically for the Glenn Meadows, is it your understanding that this issue will continue to receive favorable capital treatment from NRS or Rose at the float date in 2017? Beth Bombara : Yes, we do not expect any change in how those would be considered. Scott Frost : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Jamminder Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jamminder Bhullar : Thanks. Hi, Good morning. Most of my questions were answered, but I had one for Doug. Overall I thought the results were pretty strong, but you did have weak premium growth in the non-AARP agency channels. Just wondering what is driving that and what are you doing to turn that around? What your expectations are for that channel? Douglas Elliot : So that part of the challenge in our personal lines area is not new to the quarter. So we have had pressure in there. We see lots of competition. There are lots of names that continue to compete in that space. I\u2019m very encouraged. I like where our team is headed. You know we have made a couple of very important additions in the last ninety day, so I feel good about that, and I think we will be talking more about strategy through the next couple of quarters, particularly in that personal lines area. Operator : The next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is open. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Hartford. It seems like there is a lot of deals going on right now in the marketplace, and I have never seen the Property Casualty world undergo more changes than we\u2019re seeing today, and the glass half full is just going to create opportunities and as there this is eruption in competitors. The glass half empty perspective would be maybe you need to rethink where you are as far as scale, tax structure, technology, efficiency, etc. Where do you see Hartford in this world, and I am sure you\u2019re going to take the glass half full preference, but maybe respond to the negative issues that some might suggest are popping up? Christopher Swift : Bob, it\u2019s Chris. I think you outline some good points. We think about it generally as we are entering a very dynamic cycle, and that really every company, including our own, needs to think about competitive advantages. There is really a couple of drivers that we see. One, not all the industry participants have really enjoyed the price increases that we and others have had over the last three years, and pushed so hard to maintain. Generally, lower economic growth and continued low interest rates is really has a compounding effect on companies balance sheets and ability to investment in new technology and capabilities while producing good financial results. Alternative capital is just obviously disrupting some of the reinsurance base and it\u2019s got the potential to creep into other aspects of the market. And then very important for I think for all of us is that distribution in our agents and broker partners are really going through their own form of industry consolidations, which ultimately means in my judgment that fewer carriers are going to be on panels. And brokers and agent will continue to look for those companies that have the most to offer for their clients. So I think the table stakes are higher to sort of meet the requirements of today. Ultimately as a national company, Bob, with a lot of great strengths, brand reputation, capabilities, new energy and vigor around it. I\u2019m very optimistic of our ability to continue to compete and have competitive advantage to drive shareholder value going forward. So it\u2019s probably not any one of those things. It\u2019s probably all of it that we\u2019re trying to-- I\u2019ll call it manage for outcomes that we think are best for our shareholders and ultimately our employees and customers. Bob Glasspiegel : That\u2019s a very fair answer. Is the pivot to M&A recognition that scale is going to be increasingly important and you need more volume to do the technology spend that you are signaling is necessary? Christopher Swift : Yeah, I would say in and by itself, scale is not a driver. If you really look at our words and really what we\u2019ve talked about here is adding new capabilities that we don\u2019t have today or areas of the market-- the risk taking market. We\u2019d like to participate more in. I\u2019m sorry, I think that is more of an immediate focus, but you make a good point. Scale helps out, too. Obviously from an expense and efficiency side. And if you look at, at least one big deal that happened in New Jersey not too long ago. I mean, and we really think it in terms of it will over a longer period of time be a very compelling transaction that drives down unit costs, has greater tax efficiency, has a greater capital base to potentially take on risk. So those are all the things that we\u2019re very well off.. But we also know what we\u2019re focused on and particularly our segments of the market that we think we have great competitive advantage in. Bob Glasspiegel : Fair answers. Thank you. Beth Bombara : Thanks, Bob. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Chris. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford. Also want to note that Beth Bombara will be attending the KBW insurance conference on September 9th and we hope to see you all there. If you have any follow up questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact either Sean or myself today by phone or email. Thank you and so long. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Ian, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to The Hartford\u2019s webcast for third quarter 2015 financial results. Our third quarter financial results news release, investor financial supplement, presentation and 10-Q were all released yesterday afternoon and are posted on our website. Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. Just a few notes before Chris begins, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are also available on our website. Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the news release and financial supplement. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Thank you, Sabra. Good morning, everyone. Last night we announced our financial results for the third quarter. While we delivered strong underlying performance in our commercial lines and group benefit businesses, we did experienced some headwinds in several areas, resulting in a decrease in core earnings, lower net investment income, prior year development in commercial lines, and higher cats and loss costs in personal lines were the primary contributors to a 19% decline in core earnings per diluted share. Net investment income was down 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. This decline is mainly due to hedge fund performance in the quarter. However, year-to-date results remain ahead of our outlook for alternative investments in aggregate. We also had some notable achievements, including increase in 12 months core earnings return on equity to 9.1% and growing book value per diluted share by 8%. In mutual funds, net flows year-to-date were at the highest level we\u2019ve seen since 2010 and in Talcott, our execution remains steady, where we continue to successfully manage the risk of the book and return capital to the holding company for more creative uses. Doug and Beth will cover operating results in more detail. I wanted to share a few thoughts on our results. In commercial lines, the underlying combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development improved 1 point over prior year. This result was driven by small commercial and specialty commercial, which delivered underlying combined ratios of 86.8 and 99.1, respectively, or better than prior year. The underlying results in middle-market were steady versus last year. However, prior-year development in general liability and commercial auto contributed to the deterioration in the total combined ratio. Personal lines cat losses were elevated versus prior year, although, below our expectations. We saw and reacted to recent signs of increased auto frequency, which impacted our combined ratio. We also experienced elevated non-cat property losses compared to the prior year. This business is always required that we actively utilize data and analytics to monitor trends and make adjustments, and that is exactly what we're doing. Group benefits delivered another strong quarter with core earnings margin of 5.5%, improving a full point from prior year. The year-to-date margin of 5.9 is the best we've seen since 2008. In addition, the group benefits team recently signed a renewal rights agreement for AIG\u2019s under 100 lives employer segment, which aligns with our objective to grow in the small and middle-market areas. Looking ahead, we are focused on executing on our strategy even as we face a more competitive and dynamic industry environment. We share some examples of these efforts. Relative to distribution in commercial P&C we are on track to meet our goal of adding sales and underwriting talent in targeted geographies like the West and Midwest regions, which will help us be more responsive to customer needs. In group benefits, we increased the number of sales representatives in the under 500 lives employer segment to complement our national account segment. The goal is to have a more balanced portfolio of small to midsized accounts, while maintaining our strength in national accounts and early results of these efforts are encouraging. In early October, Doug and I, went with a number of our senior leaders, attended the Annual CIB Conference, where we met with more than 80 of our industries top agents and brokers. These discussions confirm that the work we have been doing to expand our product offerings and risk appetite is beginning to pay off. The feedback we received also affirms our view that The Hartford has strong and growing momentum with many of these organizations, which will serve as well on our strategic journey. Talented people are the engine behind The Hartford success. I am especially proud of a care and commitment our employees show towards customers in their time of need. During the recent wildfires in California, our claims teams were able to quickly inspect 100% of claims, meet in person with all impacted customers and get them into temporary housing, no small feat considering the impact of these fires. This is exactly the kind of claims service that differentiates us and earns The Hartford a 4.8 out of 5 Star ratings with our customers. Before turning the call over to Doug, I want to emphasize that while we had some challenges in the quarter I am pleased with the progress The Hartford has made during the year. Our year-to-date results reflect a 17% increase in core earnings per diluted share over the prior year and we are focused on finishing the year strong. I am confident that we have the right people, capabilities and underwriting discipline to succeed even in an increasingly competitive marketplace as we remain focused on delivering shareholder value by increasing ROE and book value per share. Now let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug? Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I am going to provide additional details on the operating results of our Property and Casualty and Group Benefits business units, but, first, let me begin with the few observations about the market. The competitive landscape in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits is slightly more pressured than we experienced over the last four quarters. Markets remain largely rational, but there are more clear signs of aggressive new business pricing with some loosening of terms and conditions, particularly in commercial property. We continue to find opportunities to acquire adequately priced new business while remaining disciplined in our risk selection approach, mainly through more intense sales execution in our local markets with agents and brokers. In Personal Lines, competition is generally consistent with prior quarters. We continue to see opportunity for growth in the direct channel and with our differentiated AARP agency offering. Price competition in the traditional agency channel remains the norm driven by competitive raters. Third quarter core earnings in Commercial Lines was $216 million with the combined ratio of 94.5. This was an earnings decrease of $52 million versus third quarter 2014, primarily driven by adverse prior period development in commercial auto and lower net investment income. The underlying combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and prior period development, was 91, improving 1 point from third quarter 2014, largely driven by continued margin expansion in workers' compensation. This improvement reflects the solid foundation we built in recent years across our commercial businesses through rigorous underwriting and pricing discipline. Renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines was 2% for the quarter, down 1% from second quarter 2015 and 2 points from third quarter last year. Commercial auto continues to achieve high-single-digit price increases as we and the industry address weak returns in the line. Pricing in other lines is more competitive, particularly middle market. In Small Commercial, written premium grew 4% in the quarter. Strong policy retention has continued providing a nice tailwind as new business was up more modestly at 2%. The underlying combined ratio was 86.8, improving seven-tenths of a point from a year ago due to better workers' compensation margins and favorable non-cat property losses. We continue to work on distribution initiatives with our agency partners to drive new business growth. Although the market is competitive, our business model is performing well and we see the opportunity to deploy our capabilities to gain market share. In middle market, we posted a somewhat mixed quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 93.8, three-tenths higher than third quarter 2014. However, the overall combined ratio was 102.5, 8.8 points higher than last year due to adverse prior period development, primarily in general liability and commercial auto. The development in general liability was driven by a large loss in older accident years. In commercial auto, we continue to see increased severity on a relatively small number of losses, mainly from accident years 2010 to 2013. In several of these claims, there has been a pattern of significant build up in medical costs without ongoing notification to us. It\u2019s important to note that our reserving estimates assumed that these trends will processed into more accident years as well, but that certainly does not reflect the intensity of our actions to improve performance in the line. We have been working throughout the year to improve claim, product, and underwriting execution and thereby better manage outcomes on the current accident year. This includes implementing new underwriting tools and guidelines that we expect to reduce our exposure to these high severity risk profiles for both new and renewal business. And we continue to increase rates and improve our pricing segmentation to better address loss cost trends. We believe that we have begun to mitigate these trends in the current accident year but will only make that call as the data develops. Moving to the topline in middle market, our metrics continue to show that we are making effective decisions to retain well-priced business and acquiring new business when meeting our underwriting and rate adequacy thresholds. Written premium growth was 2% driven by strong renewals in marine, new business growth in large property and construction, and pricing increases in commercial auto. We remain committed to improving and expanding our non-workers' compensation lines recognizing that we must be thoughtful on our approach given recent market conditions. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio was 99.1 versus 105.1 in the prior year. The 6 point improvement was driven by better loss performance in Bond and Financial Products. Last year Bond\u2019s accident year losses included a large loss while this year has returned to our historical performance. Topline growth for Specialty was 7% driven mainly by strong account retention and renewal premium in national accounts and to a lesser extent auto premium adjustments. In Personal Lines, core earning was $70 million for the quarter versus $71 million last year. Of the $54 million decrease, $23 million was due to higher catastrophe losses versus third quarter 2014. Our total catastrophe losses this quarter were below our expectation. However, third quarter of last year was even more favorable resulting in a challenging year-over-year comparison. Our most significant events this quarter were the California wildfires which resulted in $56 million of pretax losses, the underlying combined ratio of 95.6 deteriorated 4.7 points from last year driven by increases in auto frequency, non-cat homeowner losses and marketing expenses. Let me provide more detail on each of those items. First, auto frequency increased 3% in the quarter after several quarters of flat to negative indications. We had anticipated some increase in our frequency this quarter known that we had a very favorable frequency change in third quarter 2014. On a trailing 12 month basis, our frequency change is below 1%. There have been quite a few broad-based data observations such as lower gas prices, improving employment conditions and increased miles driven that point to roads being more congested. It is very difficult to correlate this information with our specific book of business which we generally find to be less susceptible to these factors due to our weighting towards majeure drivers. However, we all travel the same roads and our customers are not completely insulated from these conditions. As a result, we have reflected a slight increase in frequency with our loss estimates and pricing assumptions. The months ahead will provide more data and we will continue to adapt our pricing and marketing strategy accordingly. Second, this quarter we start increasing non-cat homeowner losses primarily from fires and water damage, although partially offset by favorable weather losses. These types of losses tend to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. Recall that fire losses in the second quarter of 2015 were at their lowest level in seven years. We\u2019ve examined the loss profiles and at this point have not seen any particular patterns in our data. And finally, direct marketing spend is up this quarter versus third quarter 2014. AARP Direct, auto has continued to perform well and we've been planning for increased acquisition efforts in the back half of this year to take advantage of our recent product improvements. We are especially focused on driving online activity through our contact centers where our sales teams provide outstanding counseling services, have demonstrated the ability to convert prospects to customers. Total written premium for the quarter grew 1%, including 4% growth in AARP Direct and 8% growth in AARP Agency. In other agency, written premium was down 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. Our efforts engaged with highly partnered agents who value the differentiated products and services we offer are continuing. Shifting over to Group Benefits, core earnings in the third quarter was $47 million, up 24% over the same period in 2014, achieving a core earnings margin of 5.5%. The increase is primarily attributable to topline growth and a lower disability loss ratio compared to prior year. Earned premiums excluding association, financial institutions was up 3% in the quarter, driven by growth in our employer, group life and disability lines. For the quarter, fully insured ongoing sales, was up 7% to $61 million. In addition, our employer group business continues to maintain strong book persistency, around 90% on a year-to-date basis. We are having success in competitive markets. Our flow of new business opportunities is strong and we are working in a discipline yet aggressive manner to win new accounts. Long-term disability continues to be the most competitive line, despite having underperformed across much of the industry in recent years. Our disability book of business is performing well, following several years of underwriting and pricing actions and we are maintaining our steady course. Our Group Benefits value proposition has been significantly enhanced over the last several years, with improvements to our service and claims experience and the addition of a robust voluntary platform. We are well-positioned to expand this business and are confident that we have build momentum across our target markets. With that, let me conclude my comments. This is a quarter where we experienced some volatility across our auto and property lines, and we are very focused on taking appropriate actions to strengthen performance in these areas. We continued to invest in product expansion, deepen our distribution capabilities and deliver outstanding service to our customers. Markets are competitive and we're responding with discipline and focus to stay on track with both near-term actions and our long-term strategic objectives. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to briefly cover the other segments, the investment portfolio and our capital management actions before we turn the call over for questions. Mutual Funds core earnings were flat with the prior year quarter, as lower fee income due to the decrease in market levels from June 30th was largely offset by lower distribution and other operating expenses.  Total AUM was down about 5% from September 30th last year, mostly due to Talcott related AUM runoff. Excluding Talcott, AUM declined 2% due to the market decline this quarter. Fund performance remains solid, with 58% of all Mutual Funds and 74% of the equity funds, outperforming peers over the last five years, helping to improve net flows to a positive $307 million for the quarter and almost $1.1 billion year-to-date. Talcott posted stronger-than-expected core earnings of a $107 million, but down from a $122 million last year due to decreased fees and investment income, partially offset by lower expenses. The decrease in fees reflects the continued runoff in Talcott, with an 11% decrease in variable annuity contract count over the last year. Investment income was impacted by several factors, the largest item being lower limited partnership income, which was partially offset by higher bond calls and make-whole premiums than last year. In addition, Talcott\u2019s operating expenses and costs for contractholder initiatives were lower than the prior year. As I mentioned last quarter, Talcott paid a dividend of $500 million in July, in addition to the $500 million dividend paid in February. We expect to pay another $500 million dividend to the holding company in early 2016. Corporate segment third quarter 2015 core losses of $63 million were up slightly from $58 million in 2014, which included a $7 million insurance recovery. Excluding this benefit, core losses continue to decline due to lower interest expense as a result of debt repayments over the last year. Turning to investments, the credit performance of our portfolio remains strong although impairments rose slightly to $40 million before tax from $15 million in the third quarter of 2014. About half of the impairments resulted from the decision to sell some lower credit quality securities in the high-yield and emerging market portfolios. Our annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnership was 4.2% in the quarter, up slightly from 4.1% in both second quarter 2015 and third quarter 2014. Our consolidated portfolio yield held up well despite the headwind from low interest rates, as the impact of lower reinvestment rates was partially offset by the benefit of make-whole call premium and bonds, prepayment penalties and mortgages and other non-routine items. These non-routine items, which are largely correlated to the continued low interest rate environment, increased the year-to-date investment yield by about 10 basis points. Excluding these items and limited partnership, our year-to-date annualized portfolio yield was 4%, down about 10 basis points from a year ago. The P&C portfolio also is experiencing a similar pattern, declining this quarter to an annualized yield of 3.7% excluding limited partnerships. And it did not benefit from non-routine items to the same degree as the Talcott portfolio. Although P&C new money yields averaged 3.8% due to wider credit spreads, we continue to expect low reinvestment rates to pressure P&C in consolidated portfolio yield. As Chris mentioned, lower limited partnership returns negatively impacted our results, particularly in Commercial Lines and Talcott. This portfolio had an annualized return of 3% this quarter. The year-to-date return is 10%, still well above our 6% outlook. This portfolio which totals about $3 billion is roughly 60% private equity and real estate partnerships, which have earned about 18% year-to-date and 40% hedge funds, which were negative in the quarter and year-to-date. Hedge fund performance was adversely affected by the global decline in equity markets and volatility in currencies Looking at the fourth quarter, we can\u2019t accurately predict hedge fund performance because of their idiosyncratic nature. However, we do have some early visibility into real estate and private equity partnership returns, which are reported on a one-quarter lag. So far, we expect fourth quarter real estate and private equity income to decline from the strong recent performance as the valuations will be impacted by the third quarter decline in equity markets. Considering this, we currently estimate that fourth quarter limited partnership and other alternative investment income will be lower than the third quarter 2015 actual results. We've always expected limited partnerships to have more volatile returns than the rest of the general account and we have sized them accordingly. We also expect returns in the portfolio to be higher overtime to compensate for this volatility, which we certainly have seen over the past several years. Turning to our capital management program. As you know, we increased our equity repurchase authorization in July. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares for $300 million. In addition, since the end of the quarter through October 23rd, we repurchased an additional 2 million shares for $94 million, leaving roughly $1.7 billion remaining under the equity repurchase authorization that expires at year-end 2016. In addition, as a reminder, we intend to repay an outstanding $167 million debt maturity in November. I would note that our rating agency debt to total capital ratio was approximately 26.9% at the end of September, down from 28% at year-end. September 30, 2015, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI rose to $42.99, up 6% from year-end 2014 and 8% from September 30, 2014, reflecting positive net income after dividend to shareholders and the accretive impact of the equity repurchase program. To summarize, core earnings totaled $360 million for the quarter or $0.86 per diluted share. Even with some of the challenges we experienced in the quarter, we did improve core earnings ROE and grow book value per share. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved a core earnings ROE of 9.1% compared with 8.2% at third quarter 2014 in the range of 8.7% to 9.2% provided to you at the beginning of the year. In addition, our year-to-date core earnings of $2.81 per diluted share, up 17% from 2014. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. First of all to those of you listening on the webcast, I will apologize for some of the sound interference that you are getting. I just want to remind you all that the replay of the call will be available. There is also a transcript, however, given the irritation of the skipping what I want to do is repeat the dial-in number. So that you can hear the Q&A session clearly. So for the dial-in, it\u2019s area code 877-685-7362. For those international, it\u2019s area code 937-999-2389 and the conference ID is 50576163. And I repeat it\u2019s 50576163. If you dial those numbers, you should be admitted automatically to the call and again the dial-in is 877-685-7362. Just a reminder to those of you who are on the call right now that we request that you limit yourself to two questions after which you're welcome to re-queue for additional questions. We appreciate your hearing to this so that we can have as many people as possible ask their questions on the call. Ian, could you please repeat the instructions for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Meredith. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thank you. A couple questions. First, can you just dive into whole frequency situation, just a little bit more here. Perhaps you can give us some more color on kind of maybe state that is coming from. Is more of it coming from AARP versus the other agency? Is it balanced? Anything that you're seeing? Doug Elliot : Brian, this is Doug. Let me start out by saying clearly July and August were little heavier on the frequency side than September. So we think some of that is attributed to summer travel and we\u2019re very interested how October will play out. So very important transit there on the top. There is obviously a state dynamic. If you look at miles driven that DOT is shared. There clearly is a West Coast and across the South dynamic of more miles driven over the 2015. We\u2019re feeling some of that in our state-by-state analysis. Next point, I would share is that as we look at the top 10 states from a Personal Lines liability perspective, essentially we were in line with market share. So we\u2019re not overlined in any of the bigger states that are driving some of this frequency change namely, California. We\u2019re aware of those states where we are and our work continues. So as I look at this dynamic, we had very favorable rolling 12 frequency changes over the past couple years. We have seen a little bit activity certainly into the third quarter. We reacted to it in our financials. We\u2019ll stay on top of our trends into October, November. And we\u2019re going to make sure that our pricing analytics are correlated with the trend you're seeing in our loss analysis. Chris Swift : Hey Brian, it\u2019s Chris. Let me just add a larger context that you guys jump into it right away. The AARP relationship has been a wonderful 30-year relationship for us and it\u2019s very strategically important. And we pride ourselves on working together with them, some of their members and have coordinated strategies and outlooks so that 80% of our Personal Lines book is AARP whether it be direct or agent. And it\u2019s -- over longer period of time has performed very well. So that when Doug refers to increases in frequencies, you got to think in terms of a lower different base than sort of a larger mass market in your Personal Lines company. So as much as we reacted to it, there is a basis difference that our book is still relatively outperforming with lower frequencies from what we could tell at this point in time. Brian Meredith : Got it. Thanks. And then my next question, one of you can just dive in little bit more into the commercial auto adverse development. What are you\u2019ll doing right now to make sure that that\u2019s going to continue here going forward. It\u2019s kind of been almost a quarterly event that we've seen recently? Doug Elliot : Brian, again this is Doug. So what we've seen most recently is some pressure between months 24 and 42 in our triangles. And as I mentioned in my commentary, primarily in years 2010 to \u201813, so we\u2019re seeing late emergence of medical information as these claims are unfolding over the couple years. Couple things are happening. One is that inside our claim operation, we\u2019re looking at diagnostics that will try to get our arms around those claims as quickly as possible. I gave an example on the call moments ago. Sometimes we don\u2019t get these till late into their life, but we are looking at our claim practices and wondering whether we can make adjustments there. And more importantly inside our underwriting, we are buckling down and making sure we\u2019ve got all the disciplines around driver behavior, past driver behavior and we\u2019re looking at new class plan tweaks, et cetera. So were working both ends of this, kind of, like we have put our arms around the issue and something that although has been frustrating, I feel like we\u2019re on top of it. Brian Meredith : So you\u2019re not seeing any increase in frequency in the commercial auto space necessarily? Doug Elliot : No, this has not been a frequency issue. It\u2019s more in the severity side for sure. Chris Swift : Brian? Brian Meredith : Yeah. Chris Swift : Again, just a context. This is primarily a middle-market phenomena. Our middle-market premium is little over $200 million on an annualized basis. So it's irritant as we feel and -- but we\u2019re trying to work through the best we can as Doug said. I think the other context too is just the larger balance sheet. And you know we\u2019re one of a few companies that has disclosed our carried reserves in excess of our actuarial point estimates and at year-end \u201814, it was about 3.5%. We continue to grow that here in \u201815. So it\u2019s just a little minor irritant in relation to the larger reserve positions that we have for adverse deviations in the future. We\u2019re very satisfied with particularly as continuing to grow those positions here in \u201815. Doug Elliot : Brian, I guess, the last point I\u2019ll just add over the top is as you know we continue to drive rate into that book of business, right. So I\u2019ve given you underwriting claim access but we\u2019re not forgetting about the need for rate to deal with that increased severity. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Sabra Purtill : Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question. Operator : You next question comes from Michael Nannizzi. I apologize from Gary -- Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you. Can you hear me? Chris Swift : Yes, we can Michael. Michael Nannizzi : Hello. Great. Doug, can we dig a little bit more into the auto -- the auto underlying combined deterioration year-over-year? Can you quantify, it looks like the expense ratio was higher? We can\u2019t really see that breakdown at the product level. Can you just help us understand like what the breakout between the expense ratio and this frequency deterioration wise? Doug Elliot : Sure, Mike. Let me see if I can maybe walk third quarter \u201915 to second quarter, I\u2019m sorry, third quarter \u201914 to third quarter \u201915 for just to take you through that. So if you look at an X to X basis, I\u2019m going to walk from 90.9 to 95.6. The frequency dynamic in our auto book, both PD and liability, roughly 2.5 points, so that 4.5 point change, so frequency driving more than half of that change. There\u2019s another point coming from ex-cat property. I talked about the fact that we've seen a few more fires, water losses in the quarter, so there's a point of that change coming from property. And then the other point or so is coming from expenses. So that's how I think about the 4.5 point move. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. So what about just in auto? Doug Elliot : In auto, you\u2019d have to rewrite that without the property premium. Obviously, the auto news has nothing to do with the homeowner change, right. So the 2.5 points waits up to within auto probably 3.7-ish or so. The other point I would make when you think about the roll-forward with auto. We had a very favorable frequency quarter in third quarter 2014. So we're comparing a little bit of a move, a 3% frequency move third quarter \u201815 to a very favorable quarter last year makes the compare more challenging. But, nonetheless, our pick is where it needs to be for third quarter \u201815. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. So, okay. Just if I can -- so if I look at the underlying combined in auto deteriorated 460 basis points year-over-year? So can you tell us of that 460 how much of that was the higher expenses? It looks like your expenses about a point higher across personal lines? I\u2019m just trying to figure out how much of that increase is expenses and how much of it is due to frequency? Doug Elliot : So 100 to 110 basis points of the 450 would be the expense move? Michael Nannizzi : Okay. Doug Elliot : The frequency, I think, you have it is 250. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. And the rest, okay, the rest of frequency. Okay, and then, so can you talk about the rate action that you\u2019ve taken so far and when do you expect to see this trend normalize? Doug Elliot : I guess the few things. As I commented, this did emerge on us over the course of the summer. September reasonably performed. So not near the patterns we saw in July and August. We are though thinking we\u2019re in a different frequency environment. In fact, we have planned for that, right. So some of our plans in 2015 suggested that we were not to see some of the favorability we had seen in \u201814 and prior. As we move forward, we obviously are watching carefully, right, whether we have a new norm of the frequency trend or not. I think it's early to call. I would not suggest that we think we\u2019re in a 3% go-forward world, but we are contemplating whether we need to move and how aggressively state-by-state. Lastly, our indications and maybe I didn't say this before, as we think about our book of business, our frequency change does not look to be because of the new business we\u2019ve written over the past year or 18 months, it looks to be across our book, and yes, there is state profile. So we\u2019re spending time with all the large states and also the small states. We\u2019re looking across all of our profiles. We\u2019re spending a lot of time on our renewal book and we\u2019ll be dealing with and are dealing with rate actions necessary to counteract where we see pressure inside the frequency. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. Okay. And then just on the middle-market book, you\u2019ve mentioned a large property loss, can you tell us as far as component of the commercial business, how many points of the combined ratio that represented? Doug Elliot : A large property loss. Michael Nannizzi : I think you mentioned in middle-market, right. Doug Elliot : I think I said [GL] [ph]. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. Doug Elliot : So we had an old claim case in our primary liability book many years back, where as we worked our way to the core settlement process with this customer. We just decided it was a time we had to change our estimates and so we did that and that was a prior development move. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. Okay. I thought I'd seen in the conference, in the presentation that you mentioned that you had a middle-market property loss, but I\u2019ll go ahead and take a look at that. I\u2019ll follow-up offline. Thanks. Doug Elliot : Okay. You got it. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Gary Ransom : Good morning. A while back you talked about a new Small Commercial initiative through the AARP channel. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on where that stands? Doug Elliot : Sure. Gary, this is Doug. We did launch an AARP initiative last summer, summer of 2014 with AARP. It has been slow to develop, but we've learned a lot. We continue to work that effort. The aggregate some of the premiums is not over-the-top of $10 million so this is still small dollars to us. But working with AARP and leveraging some of things we've done in Personal Lines, I think we've learned a lot and we continue to adjust and shift as we go forward and expect to continue the right customers that are a big part of the AARP program. Gary Ransom : Do you think this can be something quite a bit bigger over the coming years? Doug Elliot : I think it's early to call that, Gary. I'd rather give it a little bit more time. I think we probably on both sides expected a little bit more traction in the first year or so, but I\u2019m not deterred by that. I still think there are terrific customers that will become Hartford customers over time. We just have not been able to generate the traction that we expected yet. Gary Ransom : Okay. And on the higher AARP marketing cost, is there any early read on what that has generated in terms of new sales as we come after that? Doug Elliot : So it's a bit seasonal, Gary. As you know, we ramp up those efforts second half of the year, particularly leading into the January 2016 quarter. So we do not have the success yet that those marketing efforts are geared at, but I think we will over the coming months and obviously they\u2019ll be geared to geographies and our customer segments as well. Gary Ransom : Okay. Thank you very much. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Gary. Operator : Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Randy Binner : Hey, thank you. Couple of follow-ups on the frequency and then the commercial auto. So on frequency and personal auto, I just want to kind of get a simple point right, is that -- I think the narrative here is that the older drivers in this AARP heavy book are still different, is that right that they\u2019re safer drivers, they\u2019re just getting kind of caught up in collateral damage out there out on the roads? And the other piece, the AARP question is can you talk a little bit about your pricing power to push that rate against the frequency experience in that book versus what we might see in a more wholesale channel? Chris Swift : I think your first point is well taken and clearly history kind of plays that out. So our driving experience in our AARP financial experience has been very solid over a longer period of time. So yes, we believe exactly what you shared. Secondly, on the pricing piece, we\u2019re just going to have to work at this, right. This is a state-by-state, month-by-month effort. Obviously, the premiums don't all earn in day one. We\u2019re going to have to chip away over the coming quarters. It's not a three or six month process, but it's one that has already begun and one that will accelerate as we look at these patterns that are coming at us today. Randy Binner : Yeah. I mean, I guess I\u2019m thinking is like, I mean you should have better pricing power with an affinity channel, right. So I mean, have you -- I mean can you share how past pricing increases have gone in this channel? I mean, how good the retention or reception is? Chris Swift : We share retention with you in our sub, so you\u2019ve seen very steady performance in our retention area. I would expect that to continue. Consistency is a big part of that performance, right. So we\u2019re very aware of how consistent we need to perform both in a state and a product basis. And I would say that across not only Personal Lines but small commercial as well. So we intend to address the signals we\u2019re seeing here. We are going to watch carefully. But I think that our customer base is very well informed and I expect that our retention will remain strong moving through time. Chris Swift : Randy, it is Chris. Randy Binner : Okay. Chris Swift : I think the only other observation to is probably little bit of industry tailwind helping all of us given others reacting to even higher frequency, and moving rate action in various state. So, most of our policies are on a 12-month basis given the more preferred marketplace. So we don't have a six-month -- lot of six-month of policy phenomenon but the actions the others that have taken, I think will lay a path that we could draft off of. But we also do this in conjunction with our partner, AARP, right. I mean, it\u2019s their members. We want to be thoughtful we want to be consistent. We don\u2019t necessarily want to shock the system here. So, as Doug said this is a three-month phenomenon for us and we are not sure exactly where it's going to top out it but we know how do you manage the AARP relationship. We know how to manage our 50 state new regulators and I think our past performance has indicated that fairly well. Randy Binner : Okay. Great. And then just jumping over commercial auto, I think Doug had mentioned that you are getting high single-digit price increases there and maybe that was a comment for the industry as well. But, I guess a simple question is, I mean, how do we get a sense of that\u2019s enough, the commercial autos was a problem during the financial crisis years and now it is the recovery -- financial recovery problem, if you will, with the 10 to 13 accident years. It seems like these are probably litigated claims. I'm guessing where the medical is building up as well, correct me if I'm wrong there. But I mean there, is high single-digit enough. I mean, should we be getting -- should we be going forward double-digit price increases here? I mean kind of interested in reflection on that? Chris Swift : Randy, a few points for you, one is that our high single digit is approaching double. It has been approaching double over the last several quarters. So, yes we are pushing of the curve. Secondly, we are seeing the benefit inside the early looks of our 2014 and 15 accident years. So, I feel better about progress inside those years. Again, there is a liability line that takes a while to playout. So, I want some maturity before we make those calls. But I'm encouraged by progress and also the underwriting efforts underneath that are tweaking and adjusting our book of business both new and renewal continue to have their impact. Randy Binner : All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks a lot. Chris Swift : Operator, can I just make a comment before we take our next question. I think, Mike from Goldman asked a question about a property loss. I just want to come back to it. In the financial package, we did share that there was a property lost. It impacted our middle market book of business. We did have a $10 million net fire in that book of business. I think it was a point in change inside the combined ratios. So we commented on it in our disclosures. In the Midwest, I think there was a one-off but that is the answer to the fire question. Operator : Your next question comes from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. John Nadel : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Doug, maybe to beat the dead horse of Personal Lines for a moment. If I look at the year-to-date underlying combined ratio, so excluding prior year excluding cats, I think you're running through the first nine months about 91.5% if my math is right. Your guide for 2015 was a range of 89 to 91, it doesn't seem like you\u2019ll get back to that unless you get some favorable weather or something else coming through in 4Q. But I guess the question is, as we look out to \u201816, if you saw that trends that developed here in the third quarter continue. What kind of range relative to that 89 to 91 which you think would be reasonable looking out? Beth Bombara : I\u2019ll take that. John, it\u2019s Beth. So, I think we really want to get into providing \u201816 guidance at this point. I mean you're right, when we look at \u201815 in the combined that we provided at the beginning of the year, the 89 to 91 that probably running a bit about that by a point. And so as we look into preparing our views into \u201816 taking into consideration some of the actions that Doug is talking about will firm that up. But sitting here today, I think we would expect to be, kind of on the higher-end of that. John Nadel : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, I have a question about the level of earnings for Talcott this quarter and thoughts on statutory capital from Talcott as well. So, Talcott\u2019s core earnings in the quarter and if I have it right, $107 million. You had the negative impact of lower alternatives returns, but I guess that was offset or maybe partially offset by better bond prepayment income. I just sort of want to get a sense, if you had a 6% limited partnership or alternatives return there and more normal prepayments, what that segment would've looked like? And then given, you took a $500 million dividend out of Talcott in July, is it simply a matter of hedge gains given the negative market performance that drove statutory capital to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter? Beth Bombara : So, couple of things. So, first on the NII piece, you\u2019re right in that. The underperformance that we saw on the limited partnerships was really made up by the outperformance that we saw on these non-routine items. Just to give you a sense for the quarter for Talcott, it is probably around $30 million pre-tax of these non-routine items. So, I kind of think of those a little bit as a wash. John Nadel : Okay. Beth Bombara : On the surplus side, yeah, we did see a pretty sizeable increase in statutory surplus for Talcott, once you take out the effect of the demand and a couple of things. One, you're right in that because of the market performance during the quarter, we did have hedge gains and because our targets are more economic instead, the reserves did not move to the same degree. So, we had a benefit there. The other items that impacted the quarter as well, was just the recognition of deferred tax assets. That number does tend to bounce around a lot quarter-to-quarter, just because of the way the recognition rules work. So that was also a significant piece of that. So, when I think about Talcott for the year is again, if you back out the impact of dividends, we see statutory surplus up almost $450 million. I still go back to that $200 million to $300 million range we\u2019ve talked about before. I think it\u2019s at the beginning of the year. I was feeling more likely be at the lower end of that range to maybe slightly below. Sitting here today, I kind of see us now at the higher-end and potentially maybe a little bit about that. But it really is going to depend on where market conditions end for the quarter. John Nadel : And just a real quick follow-up on that. That $200 to $300 million, if we are at the upper end of the range given where things and that's a 2016 dividend out of Talcott, correct? Beth Bombara : So potentially, I think what we\u2019ve said is that we want to look and see how the year ends and some of that also. When you think about dividends, you\u2019ve got to think about where is the statutory surplus generation is coming from. It\u2019s coming from recognition of deferred tax assets. Those are hard to dividend out. They are not cash yet. John Nadel : Understood. Yeah. Beth Bombara : But as we said, we\u2019ll end the year. We will asses where we are. We do still anticipate taking out the $500 million in early \u201816 and we will evaluate what other capacity there could be depending on how we end the year. John Nadel : Thank you so much. Beth Bombara : Ian, we are ready for the next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Two quick questions if I can. First, could you give us a sense of the five of the renewal rights books that you\u2019ve got from AIG? Chris Swift : Meyer, it\u2019s relatively small, think in terms of around $30 million. Meyer Shields : Okay. And second, I think, you mentioned that you were growing in specialty large commercial property. I was hoping you can talk about that, because I think it could be one of the areas where pricing is particularly weak? Doug Elliot : Meyer, this is Doug. We have been building capability in the public entity area for last couple years that area has quite a bit of activity in third quarter, because July one tends to be a big renewal crossover for that book of business. So, couple of underwriters in that area. We have nice success. It's really had some traction. I am very pleased about how that\u2019s gotten off the ground over last of couple years. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jay Cohen : Yeah. Sure. One more on the auto frequency issue and that is, there seems to be a variance among companies as far as how they're experiencing this. We are clearly opting, Geico we have seen pick up in frequency, now you have, whereas seemingly Travelers and Progressive don't seem to be bothered nearly as much by this. And I know you don\u2019t know these companies, like you know your own company? But I'm wondering if you can reflect on some of the potential explanations for the differences we are seeing, we are all little confused by ourselves? Chris Swift : Well, let me share some thoughts and maybe some other thoughts I have just shared. I guess, as you look at miles driven, just at the core, Jay. We're seeing gas prices remain at fairly low levels and the miles driven are up. So as you think about parts of the country, we saw that over the middle part of the year and I think we just have more drivers and we have generally a better business climates. So we have both commercial and the person line drivers on the roads. It's hard to avoid accidents as they continue to occur. Again, we are -- our book has performed well overtime and we are very pleased with that. But the fact that they're on the roads today, there are just more accidents and they are part of those accidents. As we think about kind of further dissecting, there is a statewide mix as I mentioned earlier and I think that will continue to play out. I don't want to make projections of \u201916 and \u201917, but I think the state does matter congestion, et cetera. So, it's early, I don't want to take two months and make too much of it, but I also want to give you indication that we are taking a very seriously, disappointed in our quarter and we are going to work hard to make sure we are connecting the pricing and our frequency discussions. Doug Elliot : Jay, the only other observation I would have is, we\u2019ve said it before, I mean, our mature book is different than other aspects of others. So we don't know others company's books, as well as they know it, but all we know is that, the majeure driver does exhibit different driving patterns and different levels of frequency. My only other industry observation and others, I have talked about it, but I've been more attuned to just particularly with teenager and young adult the drivers is, there is too many devices in cars these days, that are potentially creating a unfocused driver situation and I think it's real. And I think, we all need to take personal responsibility to continue to put these devices down and focus on the road, because there is just too many distractions. That\u2019s all I will say on that. Jay Cohen : Okay. Thanks for the thoughts guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : Thanks. My first question is on property/casualty investment income? In the third quarter was $267 million. That included only a $5 million contribution from the limited partnerships and other alternative investments. So, Beth, I am trying to square your comments in terms of what that means for 4Q? I mean, should we expect the total net investment income for P&C to be below that $267 million in 4Q, if I understand the message you are trying to deliver? Beth Bombara : Yes. So when you look at the compare from third quarter to fourth quarter, and we think about again the limited partnership return, we are expecting to see those be below what we say in the third quarter, just base on what we see today, so that would be negative. And as I commented, P&C did not -- doesn't really seem to benefit as much as the Talcott portfolio from some of these non-routine items that also impacted the compare. Jay Gelb : Okay. And then, more broadly, would Hartford generating around the 9% return on equity in -- for the trailing 12 months? I think there is some concern now whether the company has the ability to get that higher in over the next year or so, and what are your thoughts on that? Chris Swift : Jay, I think, we feel about the improvements, obviously, we have made over the last, couple of years. So, I know, you know, this team has worked hard to deliver that 9.1 trailing where we are today and we are going to finish the year strong and we will talk about our guidance for \u201816 and beyond in February. But I think what we've been trying to signal particularly with my comments, Doug\u2019s comment, Beth\u2019s comments particularly on low interest rate, I mean there are serious competitive pressures. There is serious low interest rate pressures that are affecting the industry\u2019s book of business. And we\u2019re not going to be immune to it. So I would still say that we think we have levers to continue to manage and expand our ROEs going forward. But clearly it's not at the rate and pace that we've been able to deliver in the past. Jay Gelb : Understanding the guidance won\u2019t come in totally next year, can you direct -- qualitatively can you give us some insight on those levers? Chris Swift : Well, you know, Doug\u2019s talked about it here just in the Personal Lines book. I mean, it\u2019s underwriting actions, it\u2019s pricing action, it\u2019s a mix of business action. We\u2019re trying to be a more efficient organization, while we invest in some of our new capabilities, particularly technology. As I mentioned, coming out of CIAB, I think we have the opportunity to expand our market share, not competing on price, but by delivering more products and services to our existing customer base and they would do more business with us. So those are just, some of those on top of my thought. Jay Gelb : Excellent. Hopefully capital management as well? Chris Swift : Not clearly. I\u2019m focused on the numerator as you know. So but we do -- we have our plan through \u201816, which I think you know is meaningful and will contribute to our performance. Jay Gelb : Thanks for the answers. Chris Swift : Thank you, Jay. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. One follow-up on the prior-year development in commercial auto, so understanding the higher medical costs that you saw this quarter. Doug, is that what you\u2019ve been assuming from the standpoint of \u201814 and later loss -- initial loss picks or is that if medical costs remain at that level, you'd also have an issue there? Doug Elliot : So Tom, we are expecting some of that pattern that we've now seen emerge in 2010 through 2013, to also emerge in 2014 and beyond. So, yes we\u2019ve become a bit more conservative in our development factors in those outer months in the most recent accident years. Tom Gallagher : So, in other words, if those elevated medical costs remain -- continue as is, you shouldn't have adverse development on \u201814 and later? Chris Swift : Correct. That was our goal. That's why we made the move. Tom Gallagher : Okay. The other question I had is there was -- I guess for Beth, there was a $200 million capital contribution to a property casualty, U.K. runoff entity. Can you just provide a little color what's going on there? Is that a business you're planning on selling, anymore capital going to be needed there? Beth Bombara : Sure. So, yeah, we've been in the process of consolidating our U.K. P&C runoff businesses into a single legal entity. And so what we were disclosing with some of the activity that happened in October is this process does require court approval. We received it on October 13th, and so the capital moved around within the entities. This really is consolidating this business into one legal entity, has a couple of advantage. One actually is more efficient from a capital perspective when you take into consideration the capital standards in the U.K. And it also allows us to consolidate operations, which gives us a little bit of operational efficiency. The second point is it does provide us greater flexibility to potentially act on more permanent solutions to dealing with these types of exposures. Think about this group of business is having reserve about $800 million and I\u2019d say little less than 60% of that is asbestos exposure. But I\u2019m not going to comment on the likelihood that we actually would be able to find such a solution. Tom Gallagher : Okay. And then if I could just sneak in one last one, Beth. For the 4Q, actuarial review or balance sheet review that we should expect for Talcott, when I consider your long-term separate account return assumptions which are still north of 8%, is that a meaningful risk as we think about current interest rate level and potentially changing that as it would relate to a DAC impairment? Beth Bombara : Yes. So, correct. And that we do look at the DAC assumptions and other reserve assumptions in Talcott in the fourth quarter. Sitting here today, I think couple of things to keep in mind. You are right that our long-term assumption is in that 8% range, but we\u2019ve benefitted from many, many quarters of outperformance to that, which actually when you think about how the DAC calculation works gives you a little bit of buffer on that. So sitting here today, I do not see any changes in long-term expectations that would impact our views of that balance as we head into the fourth quarter. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Beth Bombara : Thanks. Ian, I think we have one more question in the queue, if we could take that? Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital. Your line is open. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Hartford. I was just wondering if we could just look a little bit more carefully at the homeowners\u2019 book where you\u2019ve been sort of pushing 8% rate increases and retentions being dropping a little bit. The margins aren\u2019t -- you're not making a lot of progress year-over-year, which you highlighted sort of the fluky fire losses this quarter. Have you ruled out sort of any adverse selection going on in that book and what is your overall pricing versus exposure growth doing today? Chris Swift : Bob, you're right. We have had some up-and-down behavior of that book of business that has been disappointing to us. We're spending a lot of time at a granular level inside that book of business by state, et cetera. I think more progress to come but not satisfied at all about our results. Leaning into the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter traditionally has been our best quarter of homeowners\u2019 performance. So, we hope to continue that in the fourth quarter but there are things, some of which you described that we are aggressively cutting apart as we speak right now to make sure there isn't an adverse element there. I don't believe that\u2019s the case today. But right now, leaving no stone unturned. Bob Glasspiegel : Fair thoughtfully answer. Is there any difference between the agency and the AARP book versus the similar profile? Doug Elliot : The AARP book has performed well across both our product lines. But I would say that home has underperformed in general in both areas. So, we are not accepting and feeling great about our homeowners\u2019 results across both channels and looking at all. Chris Swift : Hey, Bob, it\u2019s Chris. I would add in addition to Doug\u2019s thoughtful comments, as you said, home is very strategically important to us, it\u2019s important to the AARP relationship, it\u2019s probably a product line that we\u2019ve underinvested. And we\u2019re catching up quite honestly, but we\u2019re committed to catching up and providing more homeowners insurance to more AARP members, whether it\u2019d be on a direct basis or through agents. So no, it\u2019s got our retention. And as Doug said, we\u2019re trying to fix it as quickly as possible. Bob Glasspiegel : I think the industry is moving from that being an accommodation product to being the standalone P&L item and the professionalism of your competitors has certainly been enhanced. So I think the opportunity to achieve that is there for sure. Doug Elliot : Bob, I would agree with that. And I just I think I referred this. But clearly our performance in the AARP states has been closer to our targets than our agency performance, right. So we\u2019ve got more work to be done in the agency area, but in total, as I look across the line still not pleased that we\u2019re not quite where we want to be. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. And Ian, I believe I misspoke there is one more question in the queue. Operator : Your final question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, on the Personal Lines business, one of the reasons of the weakness obviously was higher AARP Direct marketing spending so -- and obviously that\u2019s a controllable factor. So just wondering what\u2019s your expectation for spending over the next few quarters? And if your loss costs do remain elevated, do you intend to slow down spending a little bit to balance out profitability? And then secondly, on buybacks, you spent about $300 million on buybacks in the third quarter, I realized you\u2019re on the10b-5 program, but to what extent do you have the capacity or the intent to be more proactive on buybacks given that you\u2019ve got the capital already? So if the stock price drops further, would you may be front end some of the buyback activity? Chris Swift : Jimmy, let me address the first part of your question and then maybe Beth wants to work on the second. Jimmy Bhullar : Sure. Chris Swift : We\u2019re obviously being always through the fourth quarter we have the ability to kind of look at and address what we\u2019re going to spend in the next 60, 90 days and we\u2019re doing that as we speak given the trends we\u2019re seeing. Second part of the answer I would share with you is that although I have characterized it as marketing spend, obviously part of that is the ability in our service centers to handle the demand that comes out of the marketing spend. So it is really a marketing spend in the aggregate and we\u2019re making sure that if for running ads on a weekend we are ready to handle those requests as they come in. So it\u2019s a combination of both generating frontline response and also being able to handle the flow as it comes to our centers. Beth Bombara : And then on the question on share buyback, yeah we did $300 million this past quarter and you are right, our practice has been to put in trading plan. So for the fourth quarter, our trading plan is around $350 million. We can always be opportunistic. As you know, our practice has been to really spread that out over the period. We\u2019ve seen that has worked very well for us, but it doesn\u2019t mean from time to time that we might take advantage of some opportunistic trades, but don\u2019t anticipate to deviate significantly from how we thought about this in the past. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thanks. And maybe if I could just ask one final question. On your annuity business, you fixed annuity surrenders run up, I think that because of the enhanced surrender value program that you initiated in June. So, maybe if you could just address the scope of that and has the benefit of that come through already or do you expect additional or continue elevated lapses and into the fourth quarter? And then on the VA business, your surrenders actually went down, so how much of that is just because of the drop in account values versus maybe that in the past they were elevated just given the surrender value programs that you had before? Beth Bombara : Yeah. So just the VA piece first. So, yes, we have seen a little bit of a decline in the VA surrender rate. You\u2019re right, in a market where we would see equity levels go down, we would typically tend to see those surrender rates act accordingly. But we do believe that there\u2019s a little bit of the impact of the actions we\u2019ve taken had in the past and front ended some of the surrender. So when we think about surrender rate absent any other programs that we might do in the variable annuity space, we do see then being a little bit lower than maybe what the run rate has been in the past. And then on the ISB, the program that we have in the fixed annuity book, we did benefit in the quarter from that. There is still some activity that\u2019s happening in the fourth quarter, so we might see continuously a little bit of bump from that and then as we go into \u201916, it just remains to see what other type of initiatives we might do. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today and your interest in The Hartford. Please note for your calendars that The Hartford will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference on December 9th in New York City. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to contact either Sean or myself by phone or e-mail. Thank you for your attention and have a good day.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to The Hartford\u2019s webcast for 2015 financial results and 2016 outlook. The news release, investor financial supplement and fourth quarter slides were all released yesterday afternoon and are posted on our website. In addition, there is a slide deck for today\u2019s webcast that was posted this morning. I would note that we expect to file the 2015 10-K on February 26th. Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. Just a few notes before Chris begins, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, available on our website. Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the news release and the financial supplement. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Thanks, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2015 was a successful year for The Hartford. Core earnings per diluted share increased 15% over 2014. Core earnings ROE rose to 9.2% from 8.4%. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, grew by 7%. We reduced debt by $750 million and we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders. Doug and Beth will go into further details of our 2015 performance but I\u2019d like to touch on a few highlights. First, Property and Casualty had a very strong year. The underlying combined ratio improved a half a point to 91 and top line growth continued, reflecting an increase in new business and the benefit of pricing and underwriting actions we have made over the past few years. Group Benefits had a very strong year. The business generated a 5.6% core earnings margin, exceeding our plan and pivoted to growth with a 2% increase in fully insured ongoing premiums. We continue to execute on our strategy at Talcott Resolution. The business is running off steadily, returning capital to the holding company and our hedge programs are working effectively. Our mutual funds business generated $1.5 billion of positive net flows in 2015, increased sales by 15% and delivered solid relative fund performance. And our ratings were upgraded by A.M. Best, Moody\u2019s and S&P, an affirmation of our improved balance sheet, operating performance and financial flexibility. We delivered these strong financial results and increased our top line momentum while investing in the capabilities and talent that are making us a broader and deeper risk player in a more efficient, customer-focused company that can deliver sustainable, profitable growth. For example, the strong talent we attracted to the organization, particularly in underwriting, sales, data and technology is enabling us to judiciously expand into new market industry verticals. Doug will touch upon this in a moment. The investments we made in new systems such as our claims system, our Group Benefits enrolment system and our middle market underwriting desktop are both reducing cycle times, and importantly, enhancing the experiences we are delivering to agents and customers. Our understanding of the business implications of accelerating technological change, shifting demographics and evolving customer expectations is informing the investments we are making in product, distribution and service. And recent marketing investments have increased the visibility of our iconic brand. For example, our sponsorship of Major League Baseball fully rolls out in 2016 and we recently announced the extension of our 20-plus year relationship with the U.S. Paralympics through 2020. As all of you know, the market is becoming increasingly competitive and the investment environment is less favorable. Consolidation amongst carriers as well as agents and brokers has accelerated. Legacy IT platforms are aging and are costly to maintain. We face disruption from the advent of big data, autonomous vehicles and new capital entering the market. Interest rates are low and are expected to be lower for longer. These dynamics are challenging insurance companies to reevaluate their operations and to adapt. We believe that The Hartford is well-positioned to address these challenges and to take advantage of the market opportunities they present. We entered 2016 with a strong portfolio of businesses and capital flexibility. We remain focused on organically growing each of our business and we will explore acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives. We will maintain underwriting discipline and tightly manage expenses to support ongoing investments in the capabilities and talent needed to be a top-of-mind company for the products we offer through our distribution partners. And we will continue to expand our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, with business performance and effective capital management that returns excess capital to shareholders. Our 2016 outlook for core earnings is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion. Excluding Talcott, this range represents core earnings growth of approximately 5% adjusted for favorable CATs in other items in 2015. We also intend to complete our capital management plan, including the $1.3 billion of share repurchases. In closing, let me express how proud I am of what we accomplished in 2015 and my sincere thanks to our leadership team, our employees, agents and customers, and our investors for their continued support and confidence. We have a clear strategy, an experienced and stable management team, a powerful national distribution network, differentiated products and a brand that stands for strength and integrity. As we enter 2016, I am confident in our ability to navigate this dynamic and competitive environment and continue to create shareholder value. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our 2015 results and Property and Casualty and Group Benefits, and then share some thoughts as we look forward to 2016. 2015 was another year of strong financial performance with improved results in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits. In Personal Lines, results were below our expectations but we remain pleased with the trends of our AARP Direct business and the progress we\u2019ve made to reposition Agency. Let me get right into our financial results. In Commercial Lines, we delivered over $1 billion of core earnings for the full year on an all-in combined ratio of 92.6, eight-tenths of a point better than 2014. The underlying combined ratio excluding CATs and prior year development was 90 for the year, representing 1.5 points of margin improvement. Recall that 2014 included a $49 million pre-tax benefit from New York assessments. Normalizing for this, the underlying combined ratio improved 2.3 points. This was driven primarily by improved results in workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and non-CAT property losses. Renewal written pricing and standard Commercial Lines was 2% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. In workers\u2019 compensation, our largest and most profitable line of business, loss trends continue to emerge favorably and as a result, pricing has flattened relative to the prior period. Conversely, commercial auto pricing was in the high single digits, reflecting adverse loss experience throughout the year. On the top line, written premium of $6.6 billion was up 4% from 2014 with growth across Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial. Let me provide some details on each of our commercial business units. In Small Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 86.6 was four times of a point better than 2014. Written premium grew by 4%, driven by strong retentions and $545 million of new business, an increase of $24 million or 5% year-over-year. New business growth in the fourth quarter was the strongest for the year at 9%, capping off another excellent year for this business unit. In the summer of 2015, many of you were with us at our Charlotte operation where we demonstrated the core building blocks that form the foundation for our market-leading small business platform. These include our new business submission technology, ICON, our underwriting and service centers that handle over 2 million calls annually from customers and agents, and our sales team that is relentless in partnering with distributors. Hopefully, you are better able to appreciate how these capabilities seamlessly intertwine to deliver the results we posted in 2015. In Middle Market, we made solid progress with the underlying combined ratio of 91.4, improving 3.1 points from 2014. Written premium growth was 3%, retentions were solid throughout the year and new business production of $474 million was up for a third consecutive year. The second half of 2015 was certainly more challenging and we saw that during the fourth quarter with new business premium down 13%. We\u2019re encouraged by the results in Construction and Marine, both of which posted strong new business growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.8 for the full year improved from 100.2 in 2014. This was driven by strong performance improvement in bond and financial products. National accounts achieved nearly 90% account retention and posted positive written premium growth. Bond written premium growth was modest as we have yet to see a pick-up in public construction projects. And financial products gained traction with the growth in middle market and technology E&O, two strategic priorities for the year. Overall, specialty written premiums were up 3%. Shifting over to Personal Lines, we delivered $185 million in core earnings, down 12% from prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 92 deteriorated 1.4 points from last year, driven mainly by higher auto loss costs and increased non-weather losses in homeowners. In Personal Lines auto, we experienced frequency trends above our expectations in the second half of the year. Our full year frequency trend is under 2% with the third and fourth quarters running at approximately 3.5% to 4%. We saw an increase in the summer months, largely due to increased miles driven. Trends in September and October were quite benign, as well as the early read on November. In December, there was another uptick in frequency, mainly in liability. Some of the claim activity in December related to November accidents, causing the November frequency to develop several points higher than our initial indication. And we also had relatively favorable trends in those months of 2014, setting up challenging comparisons for the fourth quarter. We continue to hone our rate plans and underwriting actions to address these frequency trends as the data matures. But it\u2019s clear to us that these patterns are a new norm and will be addressed in our rate filings. Now let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for 2015 increased to $195 million, up 8% from 2014. That results in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The full year group disability loss ratio was favorable compared to prior year, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline and favorable incidence trends. The Group Life loss ratio deteriorated due to slightly higher mortality and claim severity. Looking at the top line for reinsured ongoing premium, ex-Association-FI, increased 4% for the full year. Overall book persistency on our employer group WoCo [ph] business came in at approximately 90% for the year. And fully insured ongoing sales was $467 million, up $141 million. 2015 was a very strong year for Group Benefits. First quarter sales were outstanding, followed by solid activity throughout the year. The overall loss ratio remains steady and at attractive margins while the expense ratio, ex-Association-FI, decreased 1.1 points. All these drivers contributed to an increase in the core earnings margin during 2015. We were especially excited to welcome back several large customers as further evidence of our outstanding service and product capabilities. As we wrap up 2015, we\u2019re pleased with our continued financial progress and by the growing market strength of each of our businesses. Before I turn things over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on 2016. Although we\u2019re facing near-term pricing and competitive challenges, we remain committed to our long-term objective of profitable growth. Each of our business units has core initiatives underway for 2016. In Small Commercial, we\u2019re adding to our digital capabilities as customers and distributors demand more access and convenience. And we\u2019re expanding our product and underwriting capabilities to accommodate both larger accounts and broader coverage on our platform. In Middle Market, our priority is competing effectively at the front line, leveraging our talent with the tools we\u2019ve introduced over the past several years. Through advanced training and rigorous analytics, our field underwriters are continuously improving our reselection and pricing decisions. In product development and related areas such as claims and risk engineering, we\u2019re extending our capabilities in industry verticals such as construction, auto parts manufacturing and hospitality. Taken together, these actions allow us to effectively become a broader middle market player. Within Specialty Commercial, we rolled out a new risk management platform for national accounts, allowing customers better access to claim data and other information needed by risk managers. This investment further strengthens our value proposition in this competitive market segment and will allow us to work more closely with our customers to improve long-term account performance. We expect our overall Commercial Lines margins to remain generally stable with an underlying combined ratio between 89 and 91. We will remain disciplined with our pricing and underwriting actions, managing to both long-term loss cost trends as well as individual account performance. In Personal Lines, we have three overarching goals. The first is to improve the margins of our products, both auto and homeowners. We\u2019re investing in capabilities to better harness data and analytics and thereby refine and manage our underwriting and pricing. Second is to maximize the value of our long-term partnership with AARP. Investments in digital tools, contact service capabilities and direct marketing effectiveness are all designed to attract and retain more AARP members. And third, we will leverage the agency channel to target AARP members and other customer segments that value the expertise of agents who actively seek the benefits of our product suite and who value our service model. We expect to achieve a Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92. In Group Benefits, we\u2019re looking to drive growth in our core employer group offerings as well as our voluntary product suite. Our current voluntary lineup includes DisabilityFLEX, Critical Illness and Accident. We will add hospital indemnity in the first quarter of 2017. These products, along with our enhanced enrollment and marketing tools help individual participants to make sound decisions for their unique benefit needs. We expect our Group Benefits core earnings margin to be relatively stable between 5.5% and 6%. First quarter 2016 renewal retention is strong as is new sales activity. January sales are well above our five-year average but down versus a year ago. Recall that 2015 was in many ways a unique sales year, recovering from low market activity in 2013 and 2014. Overall, 2016 will be a year of competing in an aggressive and disciplined manner. Competition has intensified versus the year ago. We\u2019re putting our investments and enhanced capabilities to work to maintain our margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and improve financial performance in Personal Lines. We will continue to identify opportunities for profitable growth and we remain committed to smart product and underwriting expansions, building deep partnerships with our distributors and delivering outstanding value to our customers. In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with the successful year in 2015 and are looking forward to continuing our journey in 2016. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. Today, I\u2019m going to cover Talcott Resolution, the investment portfolio and full year results before turning to our 2016 outlook and financial goals. Talcott\u2019s full year core earnings summarized on Slide 19 rose 9% from the prior year to $472 million, much higher than our original outlook due to a tax reserve release, increased limited partnership income and non-routine investment income such as make-whole payments. Excluding these items, Talcott\u2019s results were largely in line with the February 2015 outlook of $340 million to $370 million. On a statutory basis, Talcott\u2019s surplus during 2015 increased by approximately $375 million before dividend to the holding company. Year-end surplus was $5 billion which correspond to an RBC of approximately 550%. In mid January of this year, the Connecticut department approved our $500 million dividend request and it was paid to the holding company last week. This payment completed Talcott\u2019s $1.5 billion capital return program that we announced in February last year. In addition, we expect to request a dividend of approximately $250 million in the second half of 2016. For 2016, we expect Talcott quarter earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. This outlook is based on the continued runoff of the VA in fixed books and does not include items like tax reserve releases or significant non-routine investment income that we had in 2015. I would note that our outlook does assume market value appreciation from year-end 2015 on VA accounts; and therefore, there is some sensitivity to market levels. Statutory results for 2016 will depend on many factors, such as the level of admitted deferred tax assets, cash flow testing reserves, limited partnership and non-routine investment income and other items that may create volatility. Based on the underlying assumptions in our outlook, we expect statutory capital generation to be in the $200 million to $300 million level, although as we experienced during 2015, it can vary a lot between quarters. Looking forward, our objectives for Talcott have not changed. We expect to maintain Talcott\u2019s capital self-sufficiency. Consistent with the past few years, we provided you an update of Talcott\u2019s capital margins on Slides 30 and 31 in the Appendix which are based on the market scenario summarized on Slide 32, pro forma for the $500 million dividend in January 2016 and the additional $250 million expected in the second half of 2016. Talcott\u2019s stress scenario capital margin at year-end 2017 is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, well above our 200% RBC minimum. This result gives us confidence that Talcott will continue to return capital to the holding company in 2017, although the actual amount and timing of 2017 dividends will depend on final 2016 results, market conditions, liquidity needs as well as the composition of surplus. And as a reminder, any dividends require regulatory approval. Given recent capital market volatility, I wanted to touch on our hedging programs for Talcott. First, our hedging programs have been effective against their targets and due to the sale of Japan, we have far less volatility in our reported results. Our hedge programs target the economics of the VA liabilities which means that gains or losses on the hedges mostly offset the changes in the economic liability to policy holders. Within the VA GMWB liability, we are largely hedged for equity exposure although not for fees and we are not entirely hedged for interest rates. Second, while our hedge programs are a key tool for maintaining Talcott\u2019s capital self-sufficiency, we will continue to have capital sensitivity to stress scenarios, including credit risk and interest rate exposures on the fixed and institutional annuity blocks. You can see these impacts on Page 32 of the slides which shows the key changes in capital margins in the stress and favorable scenarios versus the base case. Lastly on Talcott, we completed our annual assumption update in the fourth quarter which takes into consideration recent experience, including withdrawals, surrenders, mortality and operating expenses. We adjusted some assumptions, including lowering surrender rates which had a modest negative impact on fourth quarter net income. Turning to investments on Slide 20, total impairments for the quarter were $107 million. 2015\u2019s impairments are up from $63 million in 2014 largely due to intent-to-sell impairments on energy and other commodity-related securities. As for energy-related securities, our holdings totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and declined to $2.5 billion at year-end as we actively reduced our exposure during the course of the year. We believe these investments are well-positioned for a lower for longer oil and commodity price environment and we will continue to manage these holdings. During the year, we upgraded the average credit quality of our below investment grade portfolio which totaled $3.2 billion at year-end 2015. As you can see on Slide 20, we increased our exposure to BB bonds and decreased our exposure to bonds rated B and below during the year, including some below investment grade energy exposures. Turning to Slide 21, our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, has held up reasonably well, averaging 4.1% largely consistent with last year. However, excluding non-routine investment items, the yield is down about 10 basis points from 2014. The P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, declined to 3.8% in 2015 from 4% the year before, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates. As a reminder, the P&C yield is lower than the consolidated portfolio due to its shorter duration. Consistent with the decline in yield, 2015 P&C net investment income, including limited partnerships, declined 4% to $1.17 billion. In total, 2015 core earnings increased 7% to $1.65 billion or $3.88 per diluted share, which you can see on Slide 22. The core ROE rose to 9.2%, an 80 basis point improvement from 2014. And book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI at December 31, 2015, rose 7% to $43.76 compared to a 4% growth in 2014. Taking together the $0.78 in common dividends per share and the increase in 2015 book value per share, ex-AOCI, equates to total value creation of 9% per share. Let me provide a quick update on our capital management actions for the last quarter and the year. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased $450 million of shares, a little higher than the $425 million we indicated at the Goldman Sachs conference in early December. We also repaid $160 million of debt that matured in the quarter. For the full year, our equity repurchases totaled $1.3 billion and we used approximately $800 million to reduce debt, while paying more than $300 million in common stock dividends. As of February 3, 2016, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining out of the $4.375 billion authorization for equity repurchases from 2014 through 20116. For debt management, we have $455 million remaining under our plan. I\u2019ll touch on our 2016 outlook shortly but wanted to note that our 2016 outlook assumes the completion of this capital management plan by December 31, 2016. Turning to Slide 24, I draw your attention to expanded disclosures in the IFS for ROEs. As of December 31, 2014, we began providing legal entity balance sheets on Page 4 of the IFS. Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional ROE disclosures so you can now evaluate net income and core earnings ROEs in total as well as excluding Talcott. In addition, we have provided individual ROEs for P&C combined companies, group benefits and mutual funds. As noted on this chart, our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 10.9%. P&C is the largest driver of this result with a 2015 P&C core earnings ROE of 13.5%, offset in part by the impact of the corporate segment which has a lower ROE due to cash and liquid assets at the holding company. Talcott\u2019s core earnings ROE was 6.2%, about 2 percentage points higher than its run rate adjusted for the tax benefit and favorable investment results in 2015. Increasing our core earnings ROE to exceed our cost of equity capital has been an important goal for The Hartford over the past few years. In 2015, we closed that gap by achieving strong financial performance and a lower beta driven by the reduction in risk and volatility as a result of our strategic and financial transformation over the past several years. Before covering our 2016 core earnings outlook, which you can see on Slide 25, I wanted to let you know that this will be the last year that we provide a core earnings based outlook. Between the business sales in 2013 and 2014 and the financial disclosures that we provide in the IFS and our SEC filings, The Hartford is a much simpler company to analyze and model. Given many factors that cause a P&C company\u2019s results to vary, including catastrophes, prior-year development and investor returns, the vast majority of public P&C companies do not provide earnings guidance. However, we expect to continue to provide our outlook for financial metrics and capital management that will help you develop your earnings forecast. Turning to 2016, our core earnings outlook is a range of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion summarized on Slide 25. At the midpoint of the range, this equates to growth of about 5% over 2015 normalized for favorable CATs and unfavorable prior development and excluding Talcott. The table on this slide includes several of the financial metrics included in this outlook which were included in the news release last night. I would note that this year we have an outlook for P&C net investment income, excluding limited partnerships, of just over $1 billion, down 3% at the midpoint from 2015. As I stated earlier, our outlook assumes the completion of our capital management plan. At December 31, 2015, holding company cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion. In addition, we anticipate about $1.1 billion in dividends from our P&C Group Benefits and Mutual Fund businesses and $750 million from Talcott in 2016. These amounts are more than sufficient to complete the current capital management plans while also covering 2016 interest expense and dividends and maintaining holding company liquidity above target levels. Finally, before turning to Q&A, I want to reiterate that 2015 was a successful year, both financially and strategically. Our strategy has not changed and in 2016, we remain confident in our ability to make progress on our operational and financial objectives as we have done over the past several years. While markets are more challenging, our financial strength, financial flexibility and underwriting and expense discipline are important competitive advantages that will help us continue to create shareholder value. Chris and Doug shared many of our operational objectives for 2016. In addition to our 2016 outlook, our financial objectives in 2016 and beyond include the following - continuing to expand our core earnings ROE excluding Talcott, efficiently manage the runoff and return of capital from Talcott while maintaining its capital self-sufficiency, redeploy the excess capital generated by our business to create greater shareholder value, and generate average total value creation of at least 9% as measured by common dividends paid plus growth in book value per diluted ex-AOCI. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Just a reminder that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A which means we might run a little past the 10 AM deadline when some other calls begin. If you have to drop off or we don\u2019t have time to get to your questions, please email or call the IR team and we\u2019ll follow up with you as soon as possible today. Jessa, could you please repeat the instructions for Q&A? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb : Thanks and good morning. And thanks for the additional disclosure on return on equity. With regard to however you want to look at on overall basis or core basis, do you think Hartford has the ability to maintain or even potentially exceed a bit that 9% outcome on return on equity that\u2019s delivered this year? Chris Swift : Jay, it\u2019s Chris. 9.2% is what we delivered this year on a core basis. And thanks for acknowledging the expanded disclosures that Beth and the team have put out there. We think it\u2019s important that you really continue to see the progress that we can make going forward. So as I really sit here today, the 10.9% core earnings ex-Talcott, as Beth described, really does exceed our cost of equity capital today which we judge probably on a 9% to 9.5% range. And if we look forward in \u201816, I do think we could improve that 10.9%. So when I say that, really what I mean is if you look at the plan that we outlined, including normal CATs, we achieve our NII outlook, we maintain in the margins that Doug and his team are focused on and we execute the capital management plan, I think that core earnings ROE ex-Talcott could increase by 50% by the end of \u201816 - basis points, excuse me, 50 basis points. Jay Gelb : That\u2019s great, thank you. And I just have one question on the guidance. In the P&C and other operations which includes a drag from legacy liabilities like asbestos, it\u2019s been negative for the past few years and I\u2019m just wondering why Hartford isn\u2019t including any impact of that in 2016 in the guidance. Beth Bombara : Yes, this is Beth. I\u2019ll take that question. So we make our best call each year on what we anticipate for our A&E reserves. And to put a bogey out there as far as what we could expect for prior development, we don\u2019t really have a basis for doing that. The last several years, obviously we have seen charges. Years before that, we didn\u2019t. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate any reserves in the second quarter like we\u2019ve done before. Also note, we don\u2019t actually estimate any prior year development except for the accretion of workers comp discount, so it\u2019s very consistent with how we look at things overall. But it is something that we obviously take into consideration and thin about as we think about our expectations for 2016 and we\u2019ll make the call on what the reserves need to be at the time we do the study. Doug Elliot : Right. For our own models, if we were to put something in for prior year development on issues like a asbestos south [ph], that would detract from the - Beth Bombara : Yes, yes. We have not included an estimate for prior year development in our outlook. Chris Swift : And Jay, the 50 basis point improvement I talked about obviously does not include that either. So like Beth said, we don\u2019t really outlook favorable or unfavorable development at this point. Jay Gelb : I understand. Thanks again. Beth Bombara : Just one thing before you take another question, Sabra, I just did want to clarify that in my remarks, I call that our impairments for the quarter were 107 million. That was actually a full year number, not the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant from Nomura. Please go ahead. Cliff Gallant : Thank you for taking my question. I just want to talk a little bit about workers comp and what kind of loss trends you\u2019ve been seeing there over the last year. And then in terms of your guidance, what are you assuming going forward? Doug Elliot : Cliff, good morning, this is Doug. Our indications across our frequency and severity triangles, these last several years have been very favorable. 2015, our frequency still is small single digits negative across all our markets. Severity is a bit too early to predict on that tail line, but we\u2019re seeing favorable symptoms even at 12 months on the 2015 actually. And so very pleased about the last three to four action year. Indicators inside our loss triangles and it has been a driver of our improvement and profitability for sure. In 2016 moving forward, we don\u2019t see a major change in the environment, but we\u2019re still predicting that we\u2019re going to see medical inflation and indemnity severity based on wage and medical as we expect over the lifetime of these workers comp claims. And frequency, I think it\u2019s a pretty flattish scenario in the frequency world. Cliff Gallant : Okay, all right. So when we think about the guidance in the 80, 90, 91, I mean obviously those are very good numbers, but you could be painted as somewhat conservative in terms of your outlook as well. Doug Elliot : Yes, I\u2019ll let you pick the word. What I would say is that we\u2019re pleased with the progress. Particularly in middle market, this line has gone from at the bottom of our profitability curve to near the top. And we\u2019re trying to do everything we can to maintain that level of profitability in our book. Cliff Gallant : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. John Nadel : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. One on personal lines. I guess, Doug, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that in auto that you believe the pattern of higher frequency is a new norm. I guess the question I have in response to that comment by you is the 6% level of renewal rate increases, does that appear sufficient as you look forward now based on this expectation that the higher frequency is the new norm? Doug Elliot : So John, thanks. I guess I would say this first about 2015. First, the first six months of 2015 really were very quiet vis-\u00e0-vis frequency and then obviously very different patterns back after the year. As we move forward, we\u2019re reflecting kind of the increased economic activity which has got a lot of features to it as you know. We weren\u2019t quite sure and we certainly didn\u2019t have that tenant [ph] when we\u2019re with you in October when we talked about the third quarter. But it\u2019s more than a blip. We think it\u2019s going to be with us and therefore, we\u2019re building those patterns into our longer-term framework. And I would say there\u2019s upward bias on our pricing actions moving forward, yes. John Nadel : Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick one on Talcott, Beth, I think you had mentioned that if we had normalized 2015 for some of the unusual items that earnings would have been in the range that you guys had originally provided, if you compare that against the 2016, it looks like you\u2019re calling for sort of a core or normalized high single digit piece of earnings declined. Should we think about that as a longer-term trend as well in that is there really anything that should change around the case of the runoff of the underlying blocks of business within Talcott? Beth Bombara : Yes, I would say over the near-term that is a reasonable estimation of the decline. So again, a large portion of the income that comes in on Talcott is from the VA book and fees there so that continues to surrender activity there, you\u2019d continue to see decreases in those earnings. So in the near term, I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation. John Nadel : Thanks very much. Have a good day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Nannizzi : Thanks so much. Just a couple of questions on personal lines, again, but this time on the homeowners side. I mean clearly when we look at the whole P&C operations, middle markets and homeowners were areas for improvement, for harvesting some improvement at the beginning of the year, you\u2019ve clearly done that in middle markets, where are we in homeowners? And it would just seem that like now is probably a pretty good time to be fixing that business. Can you just sort of give us an update of where you are? And what sort of margin improvement are you anticipating in your outlook for 2016? Thanks. Doug Elliot : Good morning, Mike, this is Doug. Michael Nannizzi : Hi, Doug. Doug Elliot : We\u2019re working. We are working hard and you know that across both auto and home. I would say this on the homeowners book, number one, our ability to price parallel and properly underwrite through all those parallels is going through a vigorous review. We\u2019re looking at our underwriting and risk characteristics. We\u2019re looking at agency management actions. So really for both lines, we\u2019ve made quite a few changes in the past 12 months. We\u2019re down about 2,200 agencies that have underperformed for us over a longer period of time. We\u2019re going to continue to look at agency actions in the AARP agency world. We have deauthorized over 2,300 contracts in the last six months. So we\u2019re looking at every lever available to us both on the home and auto side encouraged by progress on both. But it\u2019s going to take time for those actions to earn their way in to the book of business which is why I think we\u2019re trying to be subtle and conservative as we play 2016 out. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. And do you have a notion of for the year you ran at 77 give or take for homeowners to kind of square up with that guidance you provided for personal lines? Is that where you\u2019re assuming some of that margin expansion comes in? Doug Elliot : Yes, we have hopes for improvement on both auto and home. I would say that if you look at our cat performance over a longer than one year period, we think that we can be a more thoughtful cat underwriter in the homeowners arena. Again, we\u2019re looking at pearls inside our product. So yes, between agency actions and underwriting actions on our own part, we do expect to see improvement in home over the next year to two. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. And then just back in middle markets for just a minute, that the gap there between middle and small is now 400 basis points or under 400 basis points. Do you feel like now kind of taking a step back and looking at the work you\u2019ve done and sort of what you\u2019ve achieved, I mean is there anything sort of one timing in the fourth quarter? Do you feel like this is a good starting point for you and/or looking at that sort of differential to small commercial? Has that kind of dragged what you would expect and potentially, could we see that gap close further? Thanks. Doug Elliot : Mike, I\u2019d love to see that gap close a bit further, but let me just offer a couple of comments. Number one, very pleased with the outstanding performance in small commercial. I think across the marketplace and historically against our own book of business, we\u2019re in a very solid spot and would like to grow and maintain that margin going forward. So that\u2019s a thought around small commercial. In the middle arena, a bit more duration matched here. So this is a book of business that has improved mightily over the past four years. We\u2019re watching the yield curve because duration does matter. Workers comp is a key line here as it is in small. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve reported a quarter with 89 execs in the middle in my career. So please with progress. I would say that between the pricing environment that we continue to compete in and the yield environment that affects our portfolio, we\u2019re going to stay close to those dynamics and be thoughtful in terms of our choices, risk by risk as we move through time. And also, as Chris has shared with you, we have geography goals. And we think there are other places in the country that we can find and build new relationships and be able to leverage our products that are really very solid at the marketplace. So like the progress. I think we can be a much bigger, broader player over time in middle. Michael Nannizzi : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen. Please go ahead. Jay Cohen : Yes, a couple of questions. One, you had mentioned I pretty notable reduction on the number of agents. Should we be factoring that as having an impact on your top line growth and personal lines? Doug Elliot : If you look at fourth quarter performance, Jay, you can see some of that playing out because one of the lines is down. It\u2019s down most substantially relative to the other personal lines. It\u2019s not 50% of our agency book, but it has disproportionally impacted our profit inside the book of business, Jay. So I don\u2019t think you have to make major top line modifications. I think you\u2019re going to probably see more quarters moving forward like what you saw in the fourth quarter. But we do expect to see some positive development inside our triangles from some of these actions. John Cohen : Got it. Secondly, on the small commercial side, one potential major competitor is planning to form a kind of direct distribution platform with small commercial. Two questions on this. One, do you think this has a chance of succeeding? Secondly, if yes, is Hartford well-positioned to essentially explore that channel if in fact people want to buy that way. Chris Swift : Jay, it\u2019s Chris. We\u2019re very aware of market developments and activities whether it be from traditional players of new players in the marketplace. And ultimately you\u2019re probably not going to like this answer, but time will tell. But if you look at what it\u2019s going to take to be successful, product, service, brand, reputation, claims, I mean it\u2019s, I call it an entire business model you have to be good at to keep customers for a long term which we\u2019ve been particularly very pleased and proud of our retention. So with $3.5 billion of premium and upstarts, they\u2019re going to try and we\u2019ll have to have a response which we\u2019ll be prepared for at the right time to counteract any of their measures in the marketplace. But I like our beginning point. But we\u2019re also very watchful as far as developments in the marketplace. John Cohen : Got it. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Thanks. I have two personal lines questions if I can. One, Doug, can you take us through the mechanics of the policies that are served by the agents that have been terminated? I\u2019m asking really whether that impact systems ratios going forward. Doug Elliot : So we have contracts with individual agencies both personal lines and commercial contracts, Meyer. And we obviously have to buy better provisions so there are extended contract periods. So some of them having six-month, twelve-month provision that we will continue to be partners. And then at some point in the future, that business will move elsewhere. They do shift and are not exactly the same throughout the country, but we\u2019re adhering to them. On the expense side, I think we\u2019re working hard to manage our expenses appropriately given what may happen to the top line. So I don\u2019t think you have to do any different to your models on the expense side. Chris. Chris Swift : I would just offer, Meyer, just a context here. So agents across our platform are very vital to our success. So when we talk about shrinking agents, particularly in the independent agency side, I think it\u2019s important you have a context of market segment. So our strategy here is to have meaningful relationships with our independent agents defined as being a top three carrier in their agency plan because that will dictate, I\u2019ll call it, long-term success with retention growth and profitability. Those agencies particularly in personal lines that we don\u2019t have that type of relationship with is the targeted area here for shrinking. On the other side, particularly given our AARP relationship and the importance of agents to certain AARP members that want advice and counsel, if we want to continue to support those independent agents that have the ability to attract and retain AARP customers for the long term. So it\u2019s very targeted here, our actions. So I don\u2019t want you to have the impression that - or getting out of independent agency channel and personal line or fine-tuning the definition of success ultimately from a growth and profitability side. Doug Elliot : And Meyer, I would say two other points that I would like to have. Number one, our research which we\u2019ve worked on now this past couple of years shows us that many of those AARP members do indeed prefer to work with an agent. So we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve made there. And secondly, my comment about the number of agents that have been deauthorized for AARP, those were essentially relationships that had leveraged the value of what we thought we brought to the table with this enhanced offering. So in the case that they haven\u2019t leveraged that, we\u2019d rather be contracted with those that are using it. And we think there\u2019s great value there. And working like crazy to build a very, very positive profile of customers that value our brand and our AARP members. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Second question, when you look at the different channels that you\u2019ve got, AARP, AARP agents, et cetera, is there a difference in terms of frequency shifts by channel? Are you seeing, I would expect, less uptick in AARP? Is that panning out? Doug Elliot : As we look at our trends across 2015, they\u2019re essentially very consistent across the channel. So our frequency uptick in third quarter and also fourth quarter as well as the very flat profile for the first half of the year, were essentially consistent across the channel. I think that leads down a path toward this economic dynamic with weather in the fourth quarter and a summer month vacation schedule in July and August that we felt the impact of as did many others. Meyer Shields : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Randy Binner : Thanks. I got a couple more on personal lines. I guess the first question is there was a notion earlier, recently as last conference call that the AARP book was a more mature group of individuals who were safer drivers. And so I just want to check in on that dynamic. Is that overtaken by the, I guess, the miles driven argument that\u2019s going on here. And if you quantify this - I missed it, I apologize - but are you getting on auto pricing price increase-wise, is the 4%, 5%, 6% bip? It would nice to hear that quantification because we are getting those numbers from other carriers. Chris Swift : Randy, it\u2019s Chris. Let me just take just a step back and then Doug and I will partner on this one here. I think your point on AARP is still generally true, but if you look at sort of the progression of activity over the last 12 months, Doug said is earlier. First half of the year is relatively benign from a frequency side and we\u2019re seeing normal severity trends in the 2% to 3%. I think what happened in July and August is we saw a little bit of a pop in frequency. Then September, October, it went back to sort of normal in that 1% range. And Beth and I then had an opportunity to speak at a conference in early December where then we gave an indication that we thought November would be in that 1% range also and sort of smooth out the year. But as we got into December, we had another sort of blip in frequency. And that impacted our quals on how we thought ultimately November frequency would develop. So there\u2019s a little bit of a lag factor that you have to put on this frequency trend. So when you put the third and fourth quarters together as Doug said, we\u2019re in that 3.5% to 4% range. I think our thesis still is that economic activity defined by low employment, miles driven up due to lower gasoline prices coupled with particularly in November then December, some weather in the Southwest, Midwest and West whether it be rain, sort of torrential rains at California experienced - and California is our largest personal line state - or other weather activity. All that contributed to, I\u2019ll call it, the increase in frequency incidences. That said, over a longer period of time, the AARP book still outperforms a mass market book so that when we\u2019re talking about 3.5%, 4% frequency increases, wish they\u2019ll think that is a lot lower than a broad mass market increase in frequency. So as Doug said, we are beginning and have particularly with a fourth quarter filing and a couple of our - one of our large states, we have, in essence, we reflected this new level of activity in our filings. And we\u2019ll continue to do that in 2016 and earn that out and manage actions such as underwriting or agency management actions as Doug described. I think that is the context that I just would have you to keep in mind. So Doug, would you follow up? Doug Elliot : Chris, I think you hit most of the major points. I think maybe a few to add. One is I would not underestimate our view of how much the non-rate activity should improve our performance over time, Randy. So these agency actions and really becoming a better underwriter. I\u2019m thinking about selection and undisclosed drivers and appetite management and geography. Those are all meaningful priorities for us and we expect over the next year to two years. That\u2019s point one. Point two is I don\u2019t think that dramatic change in our numbers were quite as dramatic as some of the other carriers we compete with. So yes, our frequency was not flat for the second half of the year. But it was mid-single, three-ish, three to four. So that\u2019s not 8, 10, 12. It\u2019s having an impact on our filings, it will be proportional to state. But we wanted to send the message today that we\u2019re not just at a point where we\u2019re thinking it was a blip on the radar and we\u2019re not going to adjust our patterns going forward. Randy Binner : Okay. Thank you for all that. So your price would be something like 2% to 3%, is that the right was to think of it? Doug Elliot : Our price filings are still in that mid-single digit range and probably will increase from there on auto going into 2016. Randy Binner : Got. Okay. Thank you. Chris Swift : And Randy, it\u2019s Chris. All I said is I mentioned, severity is not zero either, right? So I mean there are still more expensive cars and bumpers and devices to fix in cars when there are accidents. So I just want to be clear that severity is in that 2%, 3% range also. Randy Binner : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Erik Bass : Good morning. Thank you. Can you remind us about the composition of your alternative investment portfolio? And in your guidance, I think you assumed a 6% return for the year. But do you have early read on the first quarter results just given the market decline that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date and the lag in reporting for some of the funds? Chris Swift : Erik, I could get that to you. But I would just ensure focus on first quarter. First quarter is going to start out soft here just given market activities and the lag. Beth Bombara : Yes. So a couple of things. And we do provide a breakout of our partnership investments and our 10-Qs and Ks so you can see the update. Obviously, we file the K at the end of the month. But when you think about our total partnerships where we ended 2015 at about $2.9 billion of assets, about $1.8 billion of that is in private equity and real estate funds and the rest would be in hedge funds. And when we think about our returns in total, we plan for a blended sort of 6% return. We anticipate higher returns in the private equity funds and a bit lower in the hedge funds. And as Chris just said, as we think about first quarter, a couple of things to keep in mind. For the private equity fund, those are on a quarter lag. So what we report in first quarter will really be where they ended 2015. And for the hedge funds, they are at about a one month lag. And looking at what we expect to see for January results, we expect to see a little bit of downtick in the hedge fund performance and we\u2019ll just have to see how February comes in to see where we actually close the quarter. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. And then Beth, could you just clarify one thing on Talcott? I for your guidance, I think you mentioned that it\u2019s as of on the market at 12-31. Can you just give us a sense of how much impact the equity market movements have on earnings for Talcott now given obviously the shrinking of the VA book? Beth Bombara : Yes. So a couple of things. So the rule of thumb, what we typically look at is that for every 1% change and sort of an annualized look at S&P, that\u2019s about $2 million to $3 million of quarter earnings. So when you think about how markets have declined since yearend and sort of extrapolate that, right now looking at it you\u2019d probably say about 15 million after tax sort of pressure on the quarter earnings number. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher : Good morning. Few questions. First is just in terms of your energy exposure, if you could start with that. It looks to me like you\u2019ve been one of the more proactive companies in terms of derisking from a credit standpoint on energy. Would you say you\u2019re pretty much done with the significant reduction for that portfolio? And also related to that, how much of a gain did you book on the derivatives that were short oil as an offset against some of these impairments? Chris Swift : It\u2019s Chris. I appreciate the observation of our proactivity regarding risk. So yes, we had been very proactive with our Hemco investment management professionals, our Chief Risk Officer, Beth, myself, so we did make some early moves that turned out to be good and wise. Beth could give you the details on the exact percentage decline. But we took out approximately $1 billion of oil holdings in our portfolio. When we did that, we also decided to put on a more of catastrophic hedge on oil prices if it crashed for a long period of time. But Beth, would you just comment about some of the details? Beth Bombara : Yes. So a couple of things. So as I said, we ended the year with our portfolio at about $2.6 billion. About 91% of that is in investment grade securities. And then a little, obviously, the rest in below investment grade with 745 of that at a BB rating. So as I said here today, we feel very good about our holdings. And as always, we\u2019ll continue to monitor it. And so if there are other actions we need to take, we would take them. But right now, we felt very well-positioned with all of the actions that we took over the course of 2015. As it relates to the oil hedges, as Chris said, we put that on in early 2015 because as we looked at our portfolio, we knew that we did want to reduce our exposure there and we wanted some protection so that if prices were to decline significantly before we\u2019re able to do that, we had some offset. So actually, the hedge position we unwound mid-December because we\u2019re basically done with our activities and we were put at a modest loss of about $9 million on it before tax. But again, overall, very, very happy with the actions that we took and the position that we find ourselves in today. Thomas Gallagher : Okay, thanks. And then next question is just on the group benefits side. Doug, can you comment on - results are softer this quarter. It looks like you\u2019re assuming margins consistent with the full year. Should we take that to mean the fluctuation you saw on 4Q were just on the adverse side, you don\u2019t see any change there? Or do you need some rate there to get to the results that you\u2019re predicting for 2016 or you\u2019re forecasting for 2016? Doug Elliot : Yes, good question Tom. I think that our full year results are more reflective of how we deal about group. There was some fine-tuning at yearend. We had a little adverse mortality and severity in our life block. And a little bit of activity in LTD, not anything major. And as I look at the full year, I still feel very good about the health of our overall book of business and our ability to compete in the marketplace. So we move ahead into 2016 feeling good about the progress made. Thomas Gallagher : So Doug, no material rate needed in that business from where you\u2019re sitting? Doug Elliot : We still want to stay ahead of trend. So we\u2019ve got medical and other trends in that book of business that will impact our future plans and activities. But I don\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary difference than how we would have thought about pricing over the last 12 to 18 months. Thomas Gallagher : Okay. Chris Swift : Tom, this is Chris. Our interest rates obviously are - I think if you look at our discount rates of how we\u2019re going to discount our implied discount and our liabilities are appropriate. But as Doug said, I mean it\u2019s a great business for us. It\u2019s a major contributor of our growth orientation and our strategies. It\u2019s integral. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re recognizing its potential. Thomas Gallagher : Okay. Thanks, Chris. And then just one last one on Talcott. And this is sort of a bigger picture question to think about not so much specific numbers related to beyond 2016. But I just want to understand conceptually how you\u2019re thinking about this. So you\u2019ve obviously taken out a combination of extraordinary dividends plus the earnings generation at that business for last few years here or at least in 2015 and then the plan in 2016. But if I think about the shrinkage of that block, it looks like it is slowing a bit on the VA side. And now the majority of capital is non-VA related and those liabilities seem to be stickier. So as we think about our path over the next two, three years, is it fair to say more of the dividends coming out will just be earnings or do you still think there\u2019s a lot of latitude for taking out the bigger extraordinary dividends as well. Chris Swift : Tom, Beth can comment on her views. But I think generally you\u2019re right with the view if you look at the capital allocation. We\u2019ve got a lot of capital tied up in, I call it, the fixed annuities. But again, the amount of derisking that the book has gone through, the hedge protection, the sensitivities that Beth gave you on capital margins, it still says that we have the ability to extract some excess capital out as the block shrinks and as we produce earning. Math-wise it\u2019s hard for us to predict right now, but that\u2019s what I would say. Beth. Beth Bombara : Yes, I agree with that. I mean again you go back, we took out $1 billion of dividends last year and we anticipate taking $750 million out this year. What I think about 2017 and 2018 to your point, I first think about the capital that we generate, $200 million to $300 million range which I would point out still requires extraordinary dividend approval even though its earnings. It\u2019s a capital position of Talcott. And then I do see there being the potential for excess capital beyond that. But when I think about going into 2017, I don\u2019t anticipate the dividends being higher than what they were in 2016. And as we go through the course of the year, we\u2019ll obviously continue to update that, but you\u2019re right, it would be on a downward trajectory, not increasing when we think about the excess capital. Thomas Gallagher : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. And Jessa, I think we have one more question in the queue. Operator : We certainly do. Your last question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Please go ahead. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning. Doug, just a quick question on personal. Your outlook midpoint of the range is a one point improvement for personal lines. And in light of the fact that you\u2019re just trying to sort of address personal lines, auto pricing for the changed frequency environment and you\u2019re growing [indiscernible] in the second half, does that suggest that homeowners can offset sort of auto being in the fix mode or are there some things you can do on the expense side it gives you confidence that you can show an improvement? Doug Elliot : So Bob, you now have the sense that we\u2019re working numerous levers on both home and auto. And I do think that the first half of the year in auto will be a tough compare relative to frequency because basically they had none in the first half of last year. But they\u2019re underwriting actions. And these agency actions I described we think will improve our results over time. It\u2019s not going to be easy. And as you know, it takes a while for these actions to earn their way in. Both Chris and I are committed to making those changes and we believe we can hit the targets that we have out there. But we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in front of us, no question. And I look at headwinds into 2016, personal lines is probably just at the top of that list for the need for us to work through change to get these books in a better financial state. Bob Glasspiegel : Okay. You don\u2019t think having to put on the gas pedal in the second half contributed all to the deterioration. It\u2019s more macro trends. Doug Elliot : We believe so. We\u2019ve been very selective about where we put the gas pedal on. We\u2019ve talked to you about the fact that we\u2019ve got a new class plan that have went in two years ago. And it\u2019s been rolling in over time. But Ray Sprague and his team have been very analytical about how we\u2019ve built in our marketing plans, where we\u2019re advertising. AARP obviously is at the core of that, Bob. We look at it by state, so we\u2019re very targeted in terms of within those states, what we\u2019re doing. But I will also say to you that the overall answer is still not working. So we have more work to be done and confident that we\u2019re on the right path with the renewed team, actively engaged to get it done in 2016 and 2017 as we move forward. Bob Glasspiegel : Well, awesome. Thanks, Doug. Sabra Purtill : Thank you everyone for joining us today and for your interest in the Hartford. Please note for your calendars that Chris Swift and Beth Bombara will be at the Merrill Lynch conference on February 10th. And in addition, Beth and Brion Johnson, our Chief Investment Officer and Head of Talcott will be at the AFA conference in Florida at the end of February and early March. We hope to see you at either or both of those events. Again, we thank you for your interest in the Hartford and please do not hesitate to follow up with the investor relations team if you have any other questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Carson, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford\u2019s First Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to The Hartford\u2019s webcast for first quarter 2016 financial results. The news release, investor financial supplement slides and 10-Q for this quarter were all release yesterday afternoon and that posted on our Web site. I did want to take this opportunity to apologize for the technical difficulty that delay the posting of the supplement yesterday, while we do not expect to have this issue again, I wanted you all to know that filed a 8-K with a news release and supplement before we post the supplement on the Web site and that\u2019s usually within just a few minute after the news release goes out. So even without yesterday\u2019s snafu you can always find the supplement in the 8-K before you\u2019ll see it posted in the financial result section of our website, just to heads up because we know that earnings nights are pretty hectic.  Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. Just a few notes before Chris begins, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures, explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the news release and the financial supplement. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Thanks, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I\u2019m generally pleased with our results for this quarter, particularly in commercial lines and group benefits each of which delivered strong margins. We grew book value per share excluding ALCI\u2019s 7% over the past year and achieved a 10.3% core earnings ROE excluding Talcott. We repurchased $350 million of shares during the quarter and plan to complete our buyback program by the end of 2016. However core earnings were down 15% over the last year as we continue to face some of the same headwinds from the second half of 2015. First personal auto lost cost trends remain challenging, which impacted margins and lead to strengthening reserves for the 2014 and 2015 accident years. Second, commercial lines performance has been very strong, but compensation continues to intensify, making it more challenging to grow at acceptable returns and third consistent with capital market activity, limited partnership investment income remains low similar to the second half of 2015 with an annualized yield of only 1%. This was a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2015, were returns averaged 14%.  Given these headwinds, I\u2019m pleased with the continued progress we\u2019ve made in most of our lines of business. Doug and Beth will go into further detail about first quarter performance, but I like to touch upon a few highlights, both positive and negative. We generated strong margins in commercial lines, supported by underwriting discipline across all of our businesses. All in combined ratio improved 4.8 points, due to lower catastrophes and higher favorable prior year development, while the combined ratio excluding catastrophes in prior year development improved 2.8 points to 89.6. Group benefits remained strong with a core earnings after tax margin of 5.5%, top line growth from good January sales performance and solid in-force book persistency. All though mutual funds core earnings were down slightly, the business continues to deliver steady investment performance and had positive flows in equity funds. In February Barents recognized our 2015 investment performance naming Hartford Funds as a Top 10 fund family for the third time in the last four years. While many of our businesses sustained their track record of underwriting improvements, personal lines results were disappointing overall. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year development improves slightly to 89.7 but this was entirely attributable to the very strong homeowner\u2019s results due to lower non-cat weather and fire losses. However, personal auto results deteriorated with a 1.6 points increase in the combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year development. Doug will talk about the underlying trends that contributed to these results as well as the initiatives we have underway to improve profitability including pricing actions. Given these trends and the time needed to implement responsive actions that earn it, we currently expect a 2016 personal lines combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year development to be at or above the high end of the 90 to 92 outlook we provided in February.  Turning from our financial results, I like to provide an update on our few recent investments in products and distribution to make it us a broader and deeper risk player. On March 16, we announced our agreement to acquire Maxum Specialty Insurance Group, a well-respected ENS insurer with an experienced management team and a strong underwriting culture. The addition of Maxum will further strengthen our market leadership in small commercial by extending our product capabilities, adding ENS talent and helping to improve the customer agent experience. We are hard at work on our integration plans. Our management team recently spend time with Maxum employees introducing them to the extended team and to the opportunities that Hartford will bring to their business. In terms of the transaction process, we filed our Form-A with the Delaware regulator this month and expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter. We are all eager to begin working together and to demonstrate the power of our joint capability once this deal close. We also announced the expansion of our international insurance placement capabilities for commercial lines customers. Our new alliance with AXA [ph] corporate solution enables us to offer U.S. customers coverage for the international exposures with a primary focus on developed market such as Europe and Asia. Hartford will maintain underwriting and pricing control of these policies and will assume a 100% of the risk through a reinsurance agreement with AXA. Beside from these two projects, we are hard at work on other initiatives in investments to accelerate premium growth and improve our operating capabilities. I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the future. Before turning the call over to Doug, I\u2019d like to comment on some of the change in dynamics in the P&C industry. Some carriers are retreating or refocusing their businesses due to poor underwriting results while others are undergoing strategic and leadership changes. Technology based disruption is acceleration affecting all industry participants. At the same time, we see competition intensifying, continued low interest rates in lost cost challenges such as in personal auto. We recognize these challenges posed by these dynamics and I remain confident in our ability to navigate this more difficult environment including to work required in personal lines. The Hartford has this strong foundation and an experienced management team with the resolve to maintain underwriting discipline and expense control. We are reacting to these changes in the landscape and are focused on execution. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. We started 2016 with strong results in commercial lines and group benefits continuing our solid execution from 2015 and successfully adapting to a changing competitive landscape. Results in personal lines were disappointing as we took reserve actions to address emerging auto liability lost cost trends. I\u2019ll share more in commercial lines and group benefits in a moment. But first I\u2019d like to cover our results for personal lines. Core earnings for personal lines were $23 million for the quarter down from 75 million last year. Catastrophe losses were $22 million higher in 2015 which was a particularly light cat quarter for personal lines. First quarter of 2016 included several well documented storms in Texas where we have teams currently deployed to assist our customers. Also included in core earnings this quarter is 65 million pretax of adverse auto liability development, primarily related to accident years 2014 and 2015, partially offset by favorable development in property. The adverse auto liability development for accident year 2014 resulted from bodily injuries severity trends with losses emerging more slowly than we expected. As more claims from this accident year are reaching settlement we recognize that our previous reserve estimates were too optimistic. For accident year 2015, our auto liability booking reflects the higher severity estimates that carry forward from 2014 as well as increased frequency trends. A revised estimate of ultimate frequency trend for the third and first quarter of 2015 is now approximately 1 to 2 points higher than we estimated at yearend, reflecting the continued reporting of bodily injury claims from those accident quarters. That puts our frequency call for the second half of 2015 in the mid-single digit range. The personal line underlying combined ratio which excludes prior period development into catastrophes was 89.7, improving two-tenths of a point from last year. Favorable non-catastrophe homeowner losses and a lower expense ratio more than offset adverse auto losses. Frequency which picked up in the second half of 2015 appears to be moderating somewhat in the current accident quarter at 2%. Severity on the other hand is notched up to 4%. Overall we believe that our lost cost trends are consistent with recent quarters. However as frequency and severity matures our accident quarter estimates may change. As we continue to analyze the underlying trends and understand what is driving them, we nevertheless recognize that we need to take actions to address the profitability of our auto book. We're working aggressively on several fronts, first our rate filings in the first quarter of 2016 were double the number from first quarter of last year representing an average rate change in the applicable territories of 6.5%. The number of rate filings we have planned for the full year is 40% higher than in 2015 with an average increase in those territories of 6.6% in direct and 8.5% in agencies. Given that we mainly issue 12 month policies much of the 2016 filed rate change will earn into the book in 2017. Second, in addition to addressing the underlying market trends with rate we're taking other targeted actions to improve our profitability. In agency we have terminated 2,200 unproductive relationships, de-authorized 2,300 agents from the AARP program and rolled out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. Agency written premium was down 8% in the quarter. However AARP agency was up 6%. We expect this shift in business mix to our AARP members and our more highly partnered agents to contribute to improved profitability over time. On the direct side we\u2019re targeting our marketing spend to more adequately priced customer segments and addressing underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. Our program with AARP remains the cornerstone of this business. We're confident that we have head room for growth with the current membership base and as we've seen over many years with this business we will continue to deliver both strong customer value and profitability. While personal lines clearly has challenges to address, I'm very pleased with our results in commercial lines, where we continue to prioritize retentions and margins over growth amid increasing competition. We delivered core earnings of 249 million with a combined ratio of 91.1. This was an earnings increase of 15 million from first quarter 2015 and a combined ratio improvement of 4.8 points. Lower property losses, favorable prior year development and improved workers' compensation margins were largely offset by a decline in net investment income of 37 million after tax. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were 14 million less than in 2015, while first catastrophe losses were above our expectations in both 2016 and 2015, this is typical volatility associated with storm activity. Intense weather in the Southwest particularly late in the quarter has continued into April and we're fully engaged to meet the needs of our customers. Renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to the fourth quarter of 2015. I'm very pleased with this outcome and our continued balance of retention, pricing and new business. Lost trends in workers' compensation remain favorable and returns are within our target range. We released workers' compensation reserves across commercial lines reacting to the favorable emerged frequency we've experienced in more recent accident years along with the continued benign severity trends. We had adverse development in General Liability including the GL component of the small commercial package business, often referred to as business owner's policy or BOP. Within certain risk classes we've seen an increase in claims with greater complexity and likelihood of litigation. Losses on these claims are tended to emerge more slowly and we have revised our estimates accordingly. Looking at small commercial, the business continues to perform extremely well. The strong margins posted again this quarter along with the continued top line growth reflect the momentum we have generated in this key market segment for us. The underlying combined ratio was 86.7, 2.9 points better than last year. The improvement was driven mainly by favorable non-catastrophe property losses and a modest improvement in workers' compensation results. Written premium was up 2% in the quarter reflecting strong retention and solid new business flow even as competitive conditions intensify. New business of a 146 million was up 4% from 2015. Moving over to middle market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 92, improving 1.7 points from first quarter of 2015. The improvement is largely driven by favorable non-catastrophe property losses and continued margin improvement in workers' compensation. Written premium declined 4% in the quarter. We're pleased with our retentions and ability to maintain solid pricing levels. However new business was down 21 million versus last year. Our submission flow was off 7% this quarter verse a year ago as well as more account following outside our underwriting and rate adequacy thresholds. I suspect that higher retentions across our competitors, coupled with our targeted underwriting message are driving this result. We expect moderated news business levels over the next few quarter as we balance growth aspirations with our objective to maintain the improved profitability that we\u2019ve worked hard to achieve. Within especially commercial, the underlying combined ratio is 94.3 improved 4.8 points versus prior year, reflecting particularly strong margin improvement in natural accounts and financial products. Favorable prior year development in financial products contributed to especially commercials combine ratio of 76.5, this is based on our continued favorable experience in D&L.  National accounts continues to perform well under market conditions very similar to middle market, competition is intense but we\u2019re comfortable with our retentions and the new business accounts we\u2019re winning. Finally circling back to group benefits we delivered solid results with core earnings of 48 million down approximately 8% from 2015, producing a core earnings margin of 5.5%. The main drivers to the decline were lower net investment income and slightly higher losses offset by lower expenses. The overall performance of our group life and disability, both remains strong and I\u2019m pleased with our operating performance. The modestly higher loss ratio is primarily due to year-over-year volatility in ADND claims and disability severity driven by slightly higher average wage on recent claims.  Looking at the top line fully insured ongoing premiums was up 1% for the quarter. Overall book presidency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90. Fully insured ongoing sales were 266 million for the quarter, this is our second higher sales quarter over the past six years surpassed only by first quarter 2015, which was exceptionally strong. In summary we are well positioned to cross Commercial Lines and Group Benefits to meet the challenges of increasing competitor conditions. We\u2019re focused on retaining our accounts and maintaining margins and in Personal Lines we\u2019re aggressively addressing lost trends through numerous pricing and underwriting actions. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you Doug. I\u2019m going to cover the other segments, the investment portfolio and our capital management actions before we turn the call over for questions. Mutual funds core earnings were down 2 million from the first quarter of 2016 due to the impact of lower average AUM. Total AUM was down about 6% from a year ago, consisting of a 3% decline in mutual fund AUM principally due to market levels and a 17% decline in Talcott AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity. Fund performance remains solid with 56% of all funds and 68% of equity funds out performing peers over the last five years.  Net flows were negative a 186 million as positive equity net flows were more than offset by negative flows in \u201916 comps. Over the last 12 months net flows were positive 776 million. Telcotts core earnings declined from a 111 million in the first quarter of 2015 to 77 million slightly below our outlook, as limited partnership income was significantly below our 6% annualize return assumption. Limited partnership returns impacted all of our segments which I will cover in the more detail in the investment section. Surrender activity was lower than last year at 6.7 for variables in annuity and 4.4% for fixed annuity. Annualize surrender rate in the first quarter of 2015 were at elevated levels of 10.9% and 6.2% respectively as they included the impact of several contract holder initiatives all of which concluded in 2016. Corporate reported a size better core loss of 51 million compared to a core loss of 62 million in the prior year. The primary driver was lower interest expense due to our debt capital management program. Turning to investment our before tax portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership with 4.1% this quarter consistent with both the first and fourth quarter of 2015. Non-routine investment income, such as make whole payments on bold calls was minimal this quarter totaling 6 million before tax compared with 26 million in the first quarter of 2015. The P&C portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships declined to 3.8% from 4% in the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower non-routine investment income and reinvestment rate over the last 12 months that was lower than the overall portfolio yield. This quarter\u2019s yield improved slightly over the 3.7% achieved in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower investment expenses.  Pre-tax investment income from limited partnerships with 8 million or an annualized yield of 1% compared with 99 million or a 14% annualized yield in the first quarter 2015. While returns on limited partnerships are volatile, our average annualized return of the last three years was 9% well in excess of our 6% planning assumption. The decline in income this quarter is due to losses on hedge funds and a lower income on real estate funds compared to the prior year which benefitted from gains on sales of underlying properties.  Our hedge fund performance has generally been better than the global hedge fund index. However hedge funds in general have not performed well recently and we have been reducing our allocation to them overtime. The credit profile of the investment portfolio remains strong. Total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges in the quarter were 23 million before tax compared with 42 million in the fourth quarter and 15 million in the first quarter of 2015. Energy related credit impairments have increased in the past year as credit deterioration and downgrades continue in the sector. Our energy portfolio totaled 2.4 billion at March 31, 2016 down from 2.5 billion at year end 2015 and 3.7 billion at year-end 2014, a reduction of 36% over the past 5 quarters. We sold about 200 million of energy exposure during the quarter resulting in a net realized loss of about 30 million before tax. As energy prices have remained volatile, we continue to manage our exposure proactively with a preference to own higher quality credits that we believe can withstand a lower-for-longer price environments. To conclude on earnings, first quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.95, down 9% from first quarter 2015 largely due to decrease from the partnership income and a result in personal auto. The 12 months core earnings ROE was 8.8% in total and 10.3% excluding Talcott. The P&C core earnings ROE was 12.7% and group benefits was 10.2%. These are strong results given the difficult operating and capital market environments over the past year. Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share excluding AOCI rose 7% from a year ago resulting in total shareholder value creation including dividend over the past 12 months of 8.7% versus our target of 9%. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.4 million shares for $350 million at an average price of $41.72 per share. During April through the 27 we have repurchased a 105 million leaving 875 million remaining under the authorization. As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach of repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year. To conclude, in 2016 we remain focused on maintaining margins in commercial lines and group benefits and working to improve performance in Personal Lines. Despite challenging capital markets, our investment portfolio continues to perform and we are focused on effectively and efficiently managing the write-off of Talcott.  I will now turn the call over to Sabra so that we can begin the Q&A session. A - Sabra Purtill : Just a remind you that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A, if you have to drop off or if we run out of time before we get to your question please email or call the IR team today and we will follow up with you as soon as possible. Chris, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions. Operator : Sure. Our first question is from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jay Cohen : I'll start on the personal auto side. I was a little surprised, even though you talked about pressure that you saw and you took the reserve action, when looking at the accident year ex-cat combined ratio for auto, it actually got quite a bit better than second half of last year. I would have thought, given the pressure that you saw, you would have kept a relatively high loss pick. I'm wondering why it got better from the second half of last year. Doug Elliot : Jay good morning, this is Doug. I can go back and look at those numbers specifically but obviously we had pressure in the back half of last year and as talked about in last couple of quarter particularly on the frequency side. This year as I commented Frequency is in better shape, but overall our loss transfer generally similar. The rating actions though that we were starting to take last summer are earning their way in so we\u2019re now starting to begin just begin to see the impact of the changes that we\u2019re rolling through the book, so we\u2019re trying to offset what we\u2019re seeing in lost time Jay what actions we are taking to combat that. Beth Bombara : I just want to add to that. The other thing you have to keep in mind to is there seasonality in the auto result, so we typically when we look at the compare, it would go to the prior year where you do see that, our combined ratio is on an ex-cat, ex-prior development for auto are up. So you do have to keep in mind the seasonality. Jay Cohen : That's really helpful. But it sounded as if the claims trends, the claims experience you had in second half of last year, hasn't gotten worse; you just needed to go back and make sure the reserves from 2014 and 2015 were right. But it doesn't sound like these have gotten even worse from where you were second half of last year. Is that fair? Doug Elliot : Jay what I would say is that, we did see a little uptick in the frequency of our second half and maybe this is just a good moment for me, just to define the frequencies, I think it's a complicated measure and I think it\u2019s important that we all understand exactly what we\u2019re saying. So let me just say. For us frequency does not solely equal just the number of accidents, frequency is a function of the number of accidents and the number of coverage elements associated with the original collision. So for example given accident will receive an initial report, essentially a physical damage or a collision claim, but as that claim develops, additional coverages may be involved such as medical, underinsured or uninsured or other BI elements. As a result our method for calculating frequency includes both the collision but also the other coverages involved and so what we saw in the first quarter was a development on the BI side of our frequency for the second half of 2015, it was not a development of the number of collisions but it was the BI associated and we include that in our calculation when we share our ultimate picks of frequency. And maybe one last clarifier, when we do share frequency trends we're providing an estimate of the claimed counts developed to ultimate for that accident period. Based on the accidents and related claim reported, we estimate how many more claims we expect to be reported for that accident period and that becomes our frequency measure, so it's not a calendar year intake across claim, it's not some of the other things that maybe others, maybe reporting ours is our best shot at the ultimate frequency in the quarter and what change in Q1for 2015 was the BI component of our collision claims second half of the year. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : I'd like to hear Doug talk a little bit more about the competition in middle markets. I think along those lines, just seeing renewal rate increases in standard commercial holding at 2%, retention did dip a little bit -- just curious. Is it fair to say that, given where pricing is now, the strategy is to maintain margin even if it potentially comes at the expense of some growth and some retention? Doug Elliot : Right, that's a really fair way to say, I'm very pleased with the first quarter in middle market, we're seeing intensified competition, very satisfied with our pricing performance and extremely pleased with our solid retentions, when I step back though, I want to be thoughtful about how we draw the line around new business and you saw that our dollars were down, but we are satisfied we're making good choices and I'll make that trade any day because we worked too hard to get our profitability to where it is today. So let that move back in a different direction. So, that is the balance that we're trading on across all desks across the country, I'm pleased with the first quarter start 2016. Ryan Tunis : And just as the follow-up on Jay's question, I think what -- I\u2019m just trying to get comfortable with is what we saw in the back half of last year, it sounds like it's lower initial frequency developing to something higher over the next six months or so. And now you're seeing in the first quarter you had a lower number and I mean how can we get comfortable with the fact that over the next couple of quarters that, that I think you said 2% frequency in 1Q wouldn't develop into something like 6% [ph]. I know you\u2019re reflecting that elevated BI frequency development in the way you picked the 1Q reserves if it makes sense. Chris Swift : So, we've tried to understand the dynamics of what happened in the back half of 2015 and build some of those indications into the way we're projecting first quarter '16. Obviously there's a different economic and driving climate, we understand that, we're trying to build it into our productions, but we're fairly satisfied and we feel that we have a good shot at what we think happened in the first quarter and have reflected that in our financials, but I'll say this to you that the market has changed on us, it's the reason that our filings were up, we're pricing for a different level of market, and auto activity and I think between what we're doing on the pricing side and the actions we've taken on book management, we expect to see improved progress in our auto book of business in the coming quarters, maybe not all of it in Q2 but certainly the back half of the year we expect to see demonstrable progress in our auto results. Operator : The next question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Nannizzi : Just following up a little bit there, Doug, you guys talk -- it seems like where most of the conversation here has focused on the frequency trend from 2015, but it sounded like from your filing or your release that the charge was attributable both to a lift in severity on the 2014 book as well as frequency trend. Can you help us understand those components, the magnitude of the two? And if it's a base year in 2015 on severity, how that impacted both 2014 and 2015 accident years on that front? Doug Elliot : Sure Mike and good questions and multiple features to your question. Couple of thoughts 2014, our change in our reserve position clearly is driven by the bodily injury movement that we've now seeing. I'd start by saying that our early look on '14 through the first 12 months even in the early part of 2015 was very-very positive in fact I would say that that year was running extremely positive relative to the prior years and then things started to shift throughout 2015 and clearly as we looked at that book of business the last 90 days, we've seen pressure there. So went back and adjusted '14. It might a surprise for people to understand how much of our open bodily injury claim book is still open, unpaid as of 12/31/15, I'm talking about accident year '14 unpaid at 12/31, between 40% and 50% of our BI claims are still open, that is the component that we've seen more pressure to close, those that are closing are closing for greater dollars that we expected and it's costing us greater dollars to defend those cases as well. So, what we saw through that loss component is what drove us to '14 and then you're right we rolled that change in '14 through '15 and also had to reestablish our expectations and our base for '16 as well. Michael Nannizzi : Can you give some dollars in terms of magnitude, how much was severity, how much was the 2014 issue, how much was the 2015 frequency issue? Doug Elliot : The '14 issue was all severity. Michael Nannizzi : Okay, I know, but 52 million was the total charge right, like development charge, so can you tell us, I just want to understand like the order of magnitude on the development dollars for the \u201914 issue and \u201915 issue? Doug Elliot : So the 65 million was \u201814 and \u201815 primarily right? [Multiple Speakers]. Michael Nannizzi : And then the other half also --. Doug Elliot : And then the other half was, okay. And then in the 15 year half of the 32 was frequency in half that was severity. Michael Nannizzi : Great. Thank so much for that. And also I guess, putting into perspective, Personal Lines, probably a quarter of your underwriting profitability on a run rate basis, looking at Commercial Lines here, you talked also or Chris talked in the script about running at the high end of the range on Personal Lines. Where does 1Q put you on your scale in terms of Commercial Lines? Doug Elliot : Mike I would suggest if you, when I look at Q1 \u201915 versus \u201916 we ran 2 a -- 3 points better excess year to year. Probably about a half of that would have been several property experience. The other significant chunk inside their change is our workers comp experience, I expect our comp experience to continue going forward based on all of what we can see inside our current signals that to me looks repeatable as we move forward the property had a very good quarter, I\u2019m hoping for better quarters I know we\u2019re taking better underwriting actions but I can\u2019t count on all that property going forward. So think there is a may be a third to half of that is repeatable and I hope we can repeat the property as well. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. And just -- go ahead, Chris Chris Swift : It\u2019s Chris, I just want your follow up of on Doug\u2019s point, because went we get our, quickly our BI activity, Doug said mean we still have substantial reserves open for the older accident years, I mean there does seem to be again this is anecdotal right now, there is a more litigious environment that we face. So as Doug described, the elements of our severity, there could be more on them, but seems to be much more litigation, jury awards that are exciding some of our initial expectations and reserve with adjustments that, we\u2019re reflecting to a \u201915 into \u201916 here. Operator : The next question is from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : For Chris and Beth, I want to get your sense as to looking at the 2016 guidance that was provided last year. Do you still think it's achievable to get to the low end of that guidance of 1.5 -- 7.5 billion of core operating earnings before the other legacy P&C impact? Chris Swift : Jay, its Chris. So, the guidance that we provided at yearend, it think everyone understood the assumptions based to that in that, particularly as it relates to prior year development, our investment partnerships our combined ratio picks for commercial and Personal Line so, we\u2019re out of business of updating quarterly, but I think you could determine the sensitivities, particularly at it relates to Personal Lines particularly as it relates to our net investment income and partnership so, I think you should be able to understand, were that is coming out right now. So as we said here one quarter into it, there are still three quarters they go, there is items that could break our way, or things that we\u2019ll need to continue to manage so we\u2019re not giving up on under year and still fill that the guidance we gave was appropriate. Jay Gelb : Understood. And then for the return on equity profile, the 9% return on equity for the entire Company, that was achieved during the trailing 12 months. But I'm wondering if there might be some more downside pressure to that level, especially given net investment income, if not the Personal Lines impact. Chris Swift : Yes, I think that the prior comments in your question here sort of go hand-in-hand, I mean that they both are obviously in a related to extent that, the numerator in the equation get the a little softer that\u2019s going to effect the overall ROV. So, I would agree with you that, that there are some pressures you know we face but only on quarter end, so we\u2019re going to continue to work to a very-very hard Jay as you know. Operator : Our next question is from Randy Binner with FBR. Your line is open. Randy Binner : I just wanted to follow up on some of the personal auto stuff again. So I think I was, just as a follow-up to everyone else, trying to get to the actual why, of why claims are worse on the severity side. And I think there was a comment in there that litigation is broadly worse. So I just wanted to understand that. It's not more accidents, necessarily; it's that more BI claims are developing poorly? So is that a result of litigation? Is it a result of people having worse injuries? Are you having an older driving population? Can you just flush out what's actually happening there? Chris Swift : Sure Randy let me take a crack at it. We certainly felt an increase in collision frequency, physical damage frequency, second half of 2015. That appears to have settled down in our numbers in first quarter, we\u2019re reasonably quite flattish, but yes as we shared with you last year that\u2019s off a tough compare. So we feel pretty good about collision, accidents in the first quarter. Keep in mind weather was relatively tame. So, I have to understand that as well. On the liability frequency we are seeing more features, more BI components to the collisions that are being reported and we\u2019re addressing them. So in 2015, the uptick in frequency was both more features, more coverages attached to those collisions and that is rolling into \u201916 relative to our expectations. So we reset baseline, if you will, for \u201916, we have built in our pricing programs what we think are kind of new norms for severity and frequency and we\u2019re working our way through, dealing with needing an improved financial outlook and profile for this business, we\u2019ll get there. Randy Binner : So when you say more features, is that because more coverages are wrapped together in the products you are selling? Or is it just a higher likelihood that someone has BI? Or is it more just that, because you have half your claims still open, the trial bar is being more effective at prosecuting those? Chris Swift : Yes it not more features than the policy for sure. What we think some of the condition is due to is that we\u2019re clearly seeing higher speeds on the highways and more highway accidents. And so with higher speeds those are more difficult accidents with more people hurt and more damage caused by those accidents. So I think it\u2019s the complexity and the speed of some of these accidents and we\u2019re feeling pressure inside our liability bodily injury component of getting these cases closed. Randy Binner : You mentioned -- is that the industry norm to have half the claims still open? It seems about right, but I'm just wondering if that's normal and if, as part of these initiatives, in addition to just raising prices if there's anything you can invest in more on the claims side, if these are becoming more complicated claims. Chris Swift : Couple of parts to that answer. First thing is I think that that range of 40% to 50% of open bodily injury claims on an accident year that\u2019s 18 months out is completely within the norm, so I\u2019d start there. Secondly, although I\u2019ve talked about many of our underwriting and book management initiatives, they are equally as many claim initiatives that we\u2019re embarking on both ourselves we\u2019re looking at system dynamics, we\u2019re looking at how we can cut data more effectively and so there are a number of diagnostics that we\u2019re dropping on the desktops of our claim examiners, so we can do absolutely the best job possible adjudicating claims. Randy Binner : Thank you, that's perfect. And I want to sneak in one more just to make sure it gets asked. I knew that you have a cat budget for the second quarter which incorporates a lot of things that happen in May and June. But is it possible for you to comment if you are ahead of budget so far for April, in light of the continued storms in Texas? Beth Bombara : I\u2019ll answer that. So yes our budget for second quarter is about a 151 million and we kind of look at that sort of evenly across the three months a third, a third, a third. So if you think about our budget for April about 50, we\u2019re running a little bit above that at this point, you know there obviously has been a lot of activity so the month of April has come in strong as it relates to cat activity and we\u2019ll obviously continue to monitor it through the rest of the quarter. Randy Binner : Perfect. Chris Swift : Randy its Chris. Just you make an observation as Doug said I said in my prepared remarks I mean we\u2019re obviously not happy and disappointed just where we\u2019re at particularly in personal lines. But you should know we are doubling our efforts down to fully understand these trends take the litany of actions and it\u2019s not only rate, as Doug said in his remarks, there is a number of other actions that we\u2019re aggressively getting after and just know that there is a tremendous amount of energy in our Personal Lines team to get our arms around these issues and get back caught up to trends. So I am confident we can get our arms around this. We know what needs to be done, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time but just know the energy and commitment that we\u2019re devoting to this. Doug Elliot : Right and maybe one final comment and this really is a comment across several of the questions today. I think we\u2019ve commented over the years that our ARP business has been more profitable and continues to be. So as you looked into both my comments about our rating actions which have a little more intensity around what we\u2019re doing in the agency space and also the fact that if you look at the premium indications I gave you some growth numbers and you have a sense that we\u2019re down overall in agency and you saw based on my comments that we\u2019re up in AARP agency. I think that gives you a signal that our other agency business is down significantly in the quarter. We feel good about that mix we are mixing towards the strength of this franchise which is a matured driver and we\u2019re being thoughtful of our class programs, we\u2019re adjusting as we go and I am very confident that based on all the actions we\u2019re taking we\u2019re going to see progress over the course of 2016. Randy Binner : Alright. Thanks for the comments. Operator : The next question is from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. John Nadel : Maybe a question for Beth -- but now that you have completed the original $1.5 billion dividend plan out of Talcott, the $500 million, $500 million and $500 million, and your stress scenario that you presented to us last quarter seems to indicate a pretty sizable capital cushion, I'm curious whether you have any intention at this point of going back to the insurance regulator to present perhaps another plan to extract more capital beyond the $200 million or $300 million normal dividend that you are already expecting to take out annually. Beth Bombara : For 2016, remainder of 2016 as we've said we're anticipating taking out the $250 million in the second half and for '16 that is all we're intending to do at this point. As we roll into '17 we'll obviously continue to look at overall what capital is generated in Talcott as well as just the runoff activity to determine if there's additional dividend beyond just for that normal $200 million to $300 million, but that we would look to update more towards the end of this year. John Nadel : Yes. I'm just curious about whether you have plans to -- not something that would necessarily be actionable in 2016, but you guys had obviously teed it up with the regulators sometime in advance of the $1.5 billion over an 18 month period of time. I'm thinking something similar to that. I'm looking at the policy counts and looking at the net amount at risk and the continued runoff of the annuity business. It looks like that might be setting up for some further opportunity. That's all Beth Bombara : I think and over time there obviously is additional capital that we will be able to extract, I believe I said on our last call that when I think about dividends for 2017, I think about them not being higher than what we're experiencing in '16. So again in '16 we're doing 750 million, as I said I anticipate there would be some additional access beyond just what we're generating, but I wouldn't want you to think that there would be something above sort of the level that we're seeing this year. John Nadel : Okay. And then just around the 250, which is beyond the 500 that was part of the original plan, I think at the past you have indicated that there's some sensitivity to that as it relates to the level of interest rates. Do you still feel comfortable, given where rates are? Beth Bombara : Yes, I feel very comfortable with the $250 million even with the interest rate activity that we've seen, again as we think about sizing the dividends we take a lot of that into consideration from our stress scenarios and so forth, so feel very good about our ability to do that. Operator : Showing no further questions at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Sabra Purtill for any closing remarks. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Chris. And thank you all for joining us today and your interest in the Hartford. And if you have any additional questions throughout the day please don't hesitate to follow-up with the IR team. We wish you all the good weekend and good luck for the rest of earning season. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford's Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to The Hartford's webcast for second quarter 2016 financial results. The news release, investor financial supplements, slides, and 10-Q for this quarter were all released yesterday afternoon and are posted on our website. Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have about 30 minutes for Q&A. Just a few notes before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements, and investors should consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. Our presentation today also includes several non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings as well as in the news release and financial supplement. I will now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Thanks, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. From a bottom-line perspective, second-quarter results were disappointing. Higher prior-year development, including A&E, lower current accident year personal auto results, lower net investment income, and higher catastrophe losses led to a decline in our core earnings. However, I am pleased that our commercial lines and group benefits businesses continued to generate solid underwriting results. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 5% over the prior year and 2% since yearend. You all are aware of the challenges our industry is facing due to greater commercial lines competition, unfavorable auto loss cost trends, and significantly lower interest rates. In commercial lines, competition is becoming more aggressive, especially in national accounts and Middle Market. Some companies are expanding into new markets, while other long-standing competitors are now willing to accept lower pricing or weaker terms and conditions. Renewal rate increases are hovering near short-term loss cost trends in most lines, so expanding margins from here will be difficult. While we have continued to deliver good commercial line results by focusing on underwriting discipline, retention, and maintaining underlying margins, we see fewer opportunities to grow the top line in middle and larger account markets over the next several quarters. We will continue to pick our spots prudently. In personal lines, increased vehicle miles driven as well as distracted driving have continued to put pressure on auto loss cost trends. Based on our analysis of the deterioration in frequency and severity, we strengthened reserves for accident year 2015 and increased our loss ratio estimate for accident year 2016. In hindsight, I'm disappointed we didn't recognize earlier the magnitude of the changing trends. Doug will update you on the pricing, underwriting, and agency management actions we are taking to get margins back to our targets. Personal lines is a core business for us and our 30-plus-year relationship with AARP provides a solid foundation for long-term growth opportunities. While it will take time to fully restore profitability target levels, I am confident that we will begin to see improved margins in this book in early 2017. Another issue confronting our industry is the macroeconomic environment, especially the decline in interest rates, in part due to Brexit. As it relates to Brexit, I'm confident that the global insurance markets, which have been managing insurance risk freely across borders for centuries, will make the necessary changes to adapt. In the meantime, sustained low rates will continue to put pressure on net investment income and place greater emphasis on underwriting results. Our investment team has carefully steered our portfolio through many challenges over the past few years, including the European debt crisis and the collapse of energy prices. We will remain vigilant on the evolving macroeconomic environment and emerging risk. I'd also highlight our strong risk management capabilities as our hedge programs have performed as expected in this period of heightened market volatility. During the quarter, we maintained our pace of capital returned to shareholders, with over $430 million of share repurchases and common dividends. Year to date, we have returned significant capital from Talcott Resolution to the holding company, which Beth will discuss. We expect to complete our current capital management plan of $4.4 billion of common equity repurchases by the end of 2016. Later this year, we will finalize our plans for 2017. Before turning the call over to Doug, I'd like to note that based on first-half results, we now expect the 2016 personal lines underlying combined ratio to be in the 93 to 94 range. This reflects favorable homeowners results year to date, but an approximate 5-point deterioration in the auto underlying combined ratio compared to our original outlook. That said, I am confident in our approach to the current market conditions. We are taking the right steps to restore personal auto profitability and we have the discipline to navigate the competitive commercial lines and group benefits environments. We will continue to build upon our strong franchise and invest for the future, including opportunities like the acquisition of Maxum, which is expected to close today. We will improve our operating capability and maximize efficiency while redeploying excess capital to support long-term shareholder value creation. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Commercial lines and group benefits posted a solid quarter, even as market headwinds have intensified. In personal lines, results were disappointing, as loss trends in accident year 2015 continued to emerge adversely to our expectations, driving both unfavorable prior-year development and a deterioration in our estimates for accident year 2016. Let me get right into personal lines, which posted a core loss of $55 million for the quarter, down from core earnings of $42 million last year. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior-period development, was 94.2, increasing 5.1 points versus last year. This is primarily due to higher auto liability loss costs, which I will discuss in a minute, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses. Homeowners performance continues to be excellent. We experienced a slight uptick in fire-related losses, but this is compared to a very favorable second quarter 2015. Cat losses in the quarter were $104 million, $7 million higher than second quarter 2015, but generally in line with our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with the trends of our homeowners book. Included in the personal lines underwriting loss this quarter is $75 million pre-tax of adverse auto liability development, primarily related to accident year 2015. The factors behind this adverse development remain consistent with those we described in the first quarter, which are related to higher employment, resulting in more people on the road. As a consequence, we are seeing both increased frequency and severity of bodily injury claims, which generally have the longest reporting lag and highest severity. Despite our first-quarter reserve action, losses from the 2015 accident year emerged well above our previous expectations during the second quarter. Due to the deterioration in these trends for the 2015 accident year, we also raised our 2016 accident year auto liability loss estimates, essentially carrying forward the 2015 experience. Based on our latest call, we do not expect to achieve the full-year personal lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92 that we provided in February. This included homeowners at 77 to 79 and auto at 96 to 98. As I noted earlier, homeowners results have been strong, coming in favorable to our expectations. Auto, on the other hand, is running approximately 5 points adverse to our full-year expectations. We now expect the personal lines underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 93 to 94. This incorporates our view that the rate of change in auto frequency will moderate for the second half of this year based on the elevated levels that began in the second half of 2015. And that the rate of change in auto severity will continue to hover in the low-single-digit range. The actions we described last quarter to address the adverse auto liability trends are intensifying. These include a substantial increase in the number of rate filings versus prior year; aggressive non-rate actions to improve our profitability, such as terminating unproductive agency relationships; de-authorizing certain agents from the AARP program; and rolling out a new compensation structure focused on key partner agents. On the Direct side, our marketing efforts are targeted toward preferred customer segments and we continue to address underperforming business with targeted pricing and underwriting adjustments. Our 2016 rate actions continue to accelerate, equating to over $200 million of premium on the auto line. The earned premium impact of this rate will follow and ultimately is based on the customers we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in 2017. As a result of our profit improvement steps, AARP Direct and AARP Agency written premium was up only modestly, at 1% and 3%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016. Other agency was down 17%, consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. When I step back and reflect on the first quarter of 2016 for personal lines, there's no hiding our disappointment in the results. However, encouraging signs are emerging from our various auto initiatives and I'm confident that we are moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business. Now let's shift over to commercial lines, where we had a solid quarter with core earnings of $224 million, down $40 million from second quarter 2015. The combined ratio was 95, an increase of 2.8 points versus prior year, primarily due to higher cat losses and lower current accident year margins in small commercial and Middle Market, offset by improved margins in specialty. Renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines was 2% for the quarter, flat to first quarter 2016. In small commercial, we had another excellent quarter, with strong retentions and margins. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9 was 1.8 points higher than last year. The increase is largely due to lower margins on package business resulting from higher non-catastrophe property and general liability losses, offset by modest improvement in workers compensation margins. Recall that property losses were very low a year ago, making this quarter a tough comparison. Small commercial written premium was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting strong retention, while new business was off 1% as competitive conditions intensified. We continue to advance our capabilities with initiatives in distribution, product, digital technology, and analytics, all of which are crucial in the small commercial market and are helping us maintain our leadership position despite the increasing competition. Moving to Middle Market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 91.9, up 2.6 points from second quarter 2015. This was primarily due to less favorable property losses and an increase in expenses. Similar to small commercial, second quarter 2015 benefited from particularly favorable property losses. Middle Market written premium in the quarter was flat compared to prior year. New business of $124 million increased $5 million over last year, due mainly to solid performance in our industry verticals, which we have been building in recent years as part of our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player. In other areas of Middle Market, we experienced a slight decline in both retention and new business for the quarter. This is the result of our disciplined pricing and underwriting stance in the market, with our primary objective centered on maintaining profitability. Specialty commercial had a very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 95.4 improved 3.4 points versus prior year, driven by strong margins in national accounts and the continued favorable margins in bond and financial products. Specialty commercial premium was down 2% compared to second quarter 2015, reflecting the competitive environment in national accounts. I'm very pleased with how we are navigating these markets and the pricing discipline we continue to exhibit. I'd describe the marketplace for both Middle Market and national accounts as increasingly aggressive, particularly for new business. We are seeing relative newcomers, some reemerging incumbents, as well as the traditional players offering very competitive pricing. Although we continue to win new business and renew new existing accounts at pricing that's both competitive and profitable, we expect that achieving total written premium growth in the near term will be challenging. Moving on to group benefits, although core earnings down from last year, the business continues to perform well and is operating from a strong market position with solid returns. Second-quarter 2016 core earnings of $46 million was down $10 million, producing a core earnings margin of 5.1%. The decline in core earnings was driven primarily by lower net investment income and higher group life mortality claims. The group life loss ratio increased 1.9 points to 78.1 for second quarter 2016. This is primarily due to higher claims severity, which can be volatile from quarter to quarter. Mortality trends remain in line with our expectations. On the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 1% for the quarter. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $80 million for the quarter, a 38% increase over second quarter 2015. We feel competitive pressures in this business, too, particularly in long-term disability, but had strong sales this quarter due to a large new account. In summary, our commercial lines and group benefit businesses are operating effectively in competitive market conditions and we remain focused on business retention and margins. Consistent with our philosophy across the enterprise, we are diligently pricing and underwriting, prepared to pass on business that does not meet our returned thresholds. In personal lines, we have hit a difficult stretch, but are taking numerous actions to address elevated loss cost and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the other segments, the investment portfolio, and capital management, before we turn the call over for questions. This quarter, in P&C other operations, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study. As a result of this study, we added $197 million before tax to asbestos reserves and $71 million before tax to environmental reserves. The increase in the asbestos reserves was due to mesothelioma claims not decreasing as expected over the past year for a small subset of peripheral defendants in adverse jurisdictions. The environmental charge reflects higher claims severity, including for additional properties tendered during settlement discussions and increased legal defense and cleanup costs. After tax, the A&E development increased $40 million from second quarter 2015, resulting in core losses for the segment of $154 million compared with $113 million in second quarter 2015. We are disappointed with the development on this book. And as we have said before, we continue to evaluate options for these exposures, taking into account factors such as the value we add by managing these claims ourselves, the loss of investment income versus the cost of a transaction, as well as whether it is a partial or permanent transfer of risk. Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce a definitive agreement to sell our UK runoff P&C book to Catalina. This agreement provides for a permanent transfer of these liabilities and is not expected to have a material impact on our financials. Mutual funds core earnings were down $2 million from second quarter 2015 due to lower fees as a result of lower assets under management. Total AUM was down about 4% from a year ago, consisting of a 2% decline in mutual fund AUM principally due to lower market values over the past 12 months and a 15% decline in Talcott variable annuity AUM, primarily reflecting surrender activity. Fund performance remains solid, with 62% of all funds and 70% of equity funds outperforming peers over the last 5 years. Mutual fund net flows were a negative $419 million, as positive net flows in multi-strategy investments were more than offset by negative flows in equity and fixed income. Over the last 12 months, net flows were a positive $107 million. Talcott's core earnings declined to $91 million from $171 million in second quarter of 2015, which included a $48 million tax benefit and higher limited partnership income. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, full surrender activity increased slightly to 7.7% for variable annuities and to 5.1% for fixed annuities. Surrender activity in the quarter reflects normal runoff, as there are no current contract holder initiatives. VA surrender activity decreased from second quarter 2015, reflecting the age of the block and is largely consistent with our assumptions. We recently received approval from the Connecticut Department of Insurance for the $250 million extraordinary dividend that we had expected from Talcott in the second half of 2016, and this amount was received by the holding company in July. Combined with the $500 million we received in January, Talcott has provided $750 million of capital to the holding company during 2016 as planned. We continue to evaluate Talcott's capital generation outlook for 2016, which has been negatively impacted by lower interest rates. As you may recall, we had a 2016 outlook for $200 million to $300 million of capital generation, which was dependent on markets and the runoff of the book, among other things. Compared to the beginning of the year, equity markets remain high, which supports fee income and earnings. However, if interest rates remain at current levels, we would most likely need to record additional cash flow testing reserves at year end, which would reduce or eliminate 2016 capital generation at Talcott. While we have a ways to go until year end and a lot of things can change, this will be a factor for us to consider as we determine dividends for Talcott in 2017. I want to emphasize that even at current interest rates, Talcott's base case capital margin remains very strong. And its stress scenario capital margin, while lower than what we calculated in February, is still above our minimum. In short, the low interest rate environment has not changed Talcott's ability to remain capital self-sufficient in a stress scenario. Turning to investments, our limited partnership returns totaled $40 million in the second quarter, which is in line with our 6% annualized outlook. All three asset classes had positive returns this quarter as contrasted with first-quarter 2016 losses in hedge funds and real estate. However, compared with second quarter 2015, limited partnership income was down 57% year over year. In second quarter last year, we had especially strong returns in real estate and private equity, resulting in a very difficult comparison. Excluding limited partnerships, our before-tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter, relatively consistent with the last year. However, we expect the portfolio yield and net investment income to decrease as new money yields remain below the book yield. While our current projections for full-year P&C net investment income excluding partnerships is still in line with our original outlook, the P&C portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership, declined this quarter to 3.8% from 3.9% in second quarter 2015. In addition, year-to-date results include some make-whole premiums and other non-routine items that to the extent they do not continue at the same levels will put additional pressure on second-half 2016 and full-year 2017 net investment income and portfolio yields. Turning to credit performance, our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter, with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $7 million before tax. To conclude on earnings, second-quarter core earnings per diluted share were $0.31, down 66% from second quarter 2015. Excluding prior-year development and other items listed on the segment results table in the news release, results were down about $0.15 per share or 15% due to higher catastrophe losses and current accident year personal auto results. Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 5.5% from a year ago, resulting in total shareholder value creation, including dividends over the last 12 months, of 7.4% versus our target of 9% over time. The 12-month core earnings ROE excluding Talcott, but including the A&E charge, was 8.9%, while P&C core earnings ROE, which also includes the A&E charge, was 10.3%. During the quarter, we repurchased $350 million of common equity. During July, we have repurchased 2 million shares for $89 million, leaving $541 million remaining under the authorization. As you know, we tend to be consistent in our approach to repurchases and expect to use the remaining authorization over the balance of the year. To conclude, this quarter's results were disappointing, largely due to personal auto. As Doug discussed, we have many initiatives underway to improve personal lines margins and we look forward to updating you on our progress. Aside from personal lines, underlying results in the other segments remain strong. In addition, we were pleased to see limited partnership returns back up to our 6% outlook after three quarters of low returns. While the environment remains challenging, we continue to generate capital and effectively manage the runoff of Talcott. As Chris mentioned, we expect to complete our current capital management plans by year end and will finalize our capital management plan for 2017 by year end. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Just a reminder that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A. If you have to drop off or if we run out of time before we get to your question, please email or call the IR team and we'll follow up with you as soon as possible today. Scott, could you please repeat the instructions for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi. This is Alex Scott standing in for Tom. Quick question on the A&E. Did the sale of the UK runoff business impact the A&E charge this quarter? In other words, was there an element of this charge that's some kind of true-up ahead of the transaction? Beth Bombara : Thanks for the question. This is Beth. The A&E charge that we took this quarter was not impacted by the UK sale at all. Alex Scott : Got it. And just thinking about the lower reserves pro forma the transaction, would that be expected to reduce future charges? Or do you think sort of the underlying experience you are seeing more than offsets this? Chris Swift : Alex, it's Chris. It's going to be hard obviously to predict the future. We try to make our best estimates every year with our ground-up study. There are a concentration of accounts that seem to be getting picked on year after year. But I mean, it's really hard to predict what's going to happen in the future. I think what the transaction should tell you is that we are proactively looking at our legacy books, whether it be the life or P&C side, and seeing if there are better owners for those books over a longer period of time than holding them. So we'll continue to challenge ourselves on the U.S. block, but we'll make our best estimates every year. But Beth, would you add anything else? Beth Bombara : Just the only thing I would add is if you look over the last couple of years and just the prior-year development that we've experienced on the claim that we will be transferring as part of the sale, it's been anywhere from $25 million to $55 million of prior development that we've recorded in that book. So obviously that level of reserve increases going forward would obviously not be there. Chris Swift : And we typically have done historically the UK operation in the fourth-quarter reserve studies? Beth Bombara : There is a variety of reserve studies that impact the book of business that we just sold. But the largest amount of prior development that we've experienced has typically been in the fourth quarter when we looked at non-U.S. asbestos and environmental reserves that were in that book of business. Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Hi. A couple questions here related to the personal lines. First, Doug, could you talk a little bit about why this took you all probably longer than the rest of the industry to identify some of these trends? And maybe the kind of lag in reporting. Anything related to ACA or what do you think is causing that? Doug Elliot : Good morning, Brian. Let me take a shot at that. Let me try to separate it into a few components. Number one, I think you know and we should just state it that there has been pressure across the industry the last couple of years. Right? So if we look at accident year 2015 versus accident year 2014, we do see that pressure point. At the heart of your question is why were we late on it? I would say this. Number one, our physical damage frequency estimates at year end for accident year 2015 are still holding. So the number of collisions we predicted for that accident year book still look very solid. Didn't change much in the first quarter and have not changed in the second quarter. Second piece, which we talk quite a bit in the first quarter and also have developed in the second quarter, the number of bodies that are injured in those crashes during accident year 2015, we are seeing more people injured and we are seeing more coverages influenced. So the frequency of components of loss has grown in our 2000 accident year 2015 book. And the third piece, which ties into that last statement, our bodily injury severity across the book has had pressure. And that pressure was evident in the first quarter as we look back on 2015. And we see another point to a point and a half of pressure in the second quarter. So that really forms a basis for why the changes. We are disappointed that we didn't see all of it, but we've gone back and it's not like we missed a number of accidents in our book. We are missing the features around them and have made pretty significant changes to make sure not only are we on top of 2015, but we've adjusted for 2016 moving ahead. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up there. My recollection is that most of your business is annual business. So how long is it going to take to get back to kind of where you want to be on auto profitability? Doug Elliot : When you look at our auto book and we share the numbers XX. We've got 5, 6, 7 points that we need to get back at, right? And that's probably not doable in a 12-month period. But Ray and Chris and Beth and I and the team, we are driven over the next couple of years to see incremental progress quarter by quarter. And certainly by 2018, we feel like we are going to be in a much healthier spot relative to long-term targets. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Your line is open. Randy Binner : I wanted to jump to some of the comments that Beth made around Talcott. And I guess in particular, it sounded like you said there was potential that the low rate environment could eliminate cash flow up from Talcott in 2017. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And if so, is there any change to the stress scenario you had in your 4Q 2015 presentation around low rates? Because I guess our view had been that there was enough market good guy in that test to offset the bad guy of low rates, if you will. So just trying to understand that comment better and if the rate impact has changed in that analysis. Beth Bombara : Yes, thank you for the question. Let me clarify. What I was referring to is that when we look at surplus generation in Talcott for 2016, with the potential to have to need to increase cash flow testing reserves at the end of the year, that surplus generation of $200 million to $300 million we could see decrease in it or be eliminated. I do expect that we will have dividends from Talcott in 2017. What the amount of dividends will be will be dependent on kind of where we end the year at. As we look at our stress scenarios, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital that we have and we have updated those scenarios for a steeper decline in interest rate. So when we did those scenarios at year end, we were assuming that the 10 year at the end of 2017 would be at 1.61%. And now when we stress that, we are looking at a 10 year of 1.15%. And so with that, our stress margin capital that we shared with you in December would come down and probably be slightly under $1 billion. But I think that still gives us capacity in 2017 to take dividends from Talcott. Randy Binner : So the stress margin capital of a little under 1.0 you just said, would that compared to the 1.6 that you initially had in that presentation? Beth Bombara : Yes. And that's again takes into consideration the fact that we were taking $750 million of dividend out in 2016, which we have done. Randy Binner : All right, perfect. That's all I need, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Nannizzi : I guess Doug, a couple questions back to personal lines. Sort of looking at now what we've seen manifest here, continued challenges in what appears to be getting our arms around the issue there. But when I look at the supplement and look at rate-taking activity there, it looks like you've gone from 5% before anything manifested to about 7% now. So I would like to square that to your comment about significant rate taking. But your policy count retention is flat. And new business has come off modestly. So I'm just trying to square all of those things. Like how is it that with everything that's taken place that we are not seeing the foot come off the gas entirely? Why is there any new business and why isn't retention coming down further? Doug Elliot : [Technical Difficulty] by saying that our performance in AARP versus our agency book do have different profiles over time. So there is a management of our different customer segments that just underlies all I'm talking about. But I think with that, it's important just to set the stage. Over the last couple of years starting in April of 2014, we started rolling out a new class plan designed to improve our competitiveness, particularly in underpenetrated segments. We also expanded our agency distribution around that, appointing some firms which had no prior relationships with us. And those changes were going on at a time when the industry was starting to lean into higher frequency and some severity news. So probably not the best time to be rolling out a new class plan. I want to give you some evidence of what we've been working on. The last state in that class plan was rolled out in August of last year - August of 2015. That was Florida. We now have the third fine-tuning or iteration of those class plans going into effect across the country. So we've been tuning those plans over this two-year period. We are also leaning into rate. So our achievement of rate today is greater than we expected the plan to need six months ago. And I would say to you that we are leaning in harder the second half of the year subject to our work with the various states. So the disappointment is we've leaned into a growth mode over the last couple of years at a very difficult time. Further, some of that growth was more pronounced in several states with higher overall loss costs, such as Florida. When you think about Florida, we've got a lot of retirees in certain pockets of the country. Florida at times can be one of the more challenging environments. And so we've had to go back and adjust our rate plan and our Open Road plan in some of these states aggressively. The last thing I would say to you is that in Florida as an example, we've seen across the states an emergence of a little bit more pressure in uninsured and underinsured motorists. These claims are the slowest to emerge and have the highest ultimate severity. So this pattern has shifted, with these UM claims emerging more slowly over time. And I think our severity dynamic has tied into the emergence of some pressure with UM. So I'm not making any excuses. We are tackling hard. We're tackling with pricing. We are working the product and the segmentation as hard as ever. We've made pretty material changes to distribution management, both our targeted plans and also our agency partners. And we are working across our claim operation across the country, making sure that we are on every bit of our operating strategy. So Mike, I expect to see brighter days ahead. I will tell you that in the last 45 days, we are seeing signs of this progress. Feel very good about July. But July does not make a year and it certainly doesn't make a quarter. So we'll talk more about that in the coming quarters. Michael Nannizzi : So should we expect then in the third quarter that we are going to see new business - we're not going to see any new business and we're going to see retention levels down? I mean, like when are we going to see those metrics? Because we've talked now the last few calls about this. And it just feels like on the one hand, we've got issues still trying to understand why they continue to change relative to expectations. But then on top of that, what you are doing in the field as far as new business - I hear everything you are saying, but when do we expect that we are going to see what should be a natural decline in retention as you take aggressive rate action and, you know, just a complete drop-off of new business and advertising? Doug Elliot : Let me share a few numbers of new business in the second quarter, just to stage the answer. Our AARP Direct was off 8% in the quarter. Our other agency was off 37% and our overall auto new business was off 14%. That's a demonstration of some of the moves we've made. On the pricing side, we look at the adjustments we're making and there is still big chunks of our book that are with the pricing we are putting in place, we want to retain those customers. So the numbers I shared on new are more a reflection of how we are moving into these territories and the customers we are seeking to add and bill to our book. But the retention strategies are tied into rate adequacy. And in some places, we are very rate adequate, and other places need a lot of work. And the numbers you are looking at our averages, so the span around those averages between most distressed and well under control do vary widely. Michael Nannizzi : Do you think you'll be able to provide some more granularity so that we can evaluate how you are progressing in these stressed and non-stressed books in the future? Because it sounds like - yes, it sounds like there is a big gap between what you are reporting in these numbers and what you are doing strategically. But we just don't have the information to see that. And just given the time lag that this has been going on now, I would hope that we could see a little bit more information on exactly what tactics you are pursuing and what effectiveness those tactics are having. Doug Elliot : That's fair. Let us take that back, discuss it with ourselves, and see if we can't address the gap there. Chris Swift : Michael, it's Chris. I appreciate your feedback. And hopefully you get a sense from Doug's tone and my tone that we are equally as frustrated as you are. And if a little more data helps, that's great. But I think the overall message here, too, is we have been reacting. We have been pushing ourselves since year end to look harder at things. But as I mentioned before, we are balancing this with a partner, a 30-year partner, where I've looked at history and how we've worked together, how we've grown this book. We produced strong returns over a longer period of time. And we need to balance a level of stability with AARP and its members while we are taking these aggressive actions. So as Doug said, the latter half of 2015 is when we rolled out our last state with our new class plan. We've been tuning, as we say, as we've gone along. But there are still things that have surprised us, and as Doug said, some of it was industry related. Some of it was our own self-inflicted actions. And we have to take full accountability for that. And we do. But we are working and I think you will begin to see progress, particularly as we head into 2017. And we'll look closely at the metrics that we could share with you that are appropriate so that you could gauge our progress. Michael Nannizzi : What do you expect your advertising budget will be in auto for the rest of the year relative either to the first half or to the last half of last year? Chris Swift : We've already cut 25%, 30% of our budget on direct advertising and activities along those lines. We'll continue to push ourselves, but there are areas in the country - and again, given the relationship where we still want to produce business that we think will generate adequate returns over its lifetime. So it's a balancing act. And those areas that are on fire and that require a lot of attention, we are not afraid to make those calls. On the other side, we want to be balanced, particularly with our AARP members. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks. This is a little bit of an unfair question, and I don't mean it to be hostile. But when we look at I guess the auto deterioration, the asbestos issue, and maybe the fact that the interest rate environment in Talcott - or that Talcott is facing is worse than you'd anticipated, does there need to be maybe more skepticism culturally in how you are managing the business? Chris Swift : Meyer, it's Chris. I don't know what you mean by skepticism. We challenge ourselves to perform every day at high standards. We are investing in the organization for the future. Our employees are world-class and are willing to go the extra mile. But I do know that, as I said in my opening comments, we are in a challenging period of time. But I think we have the ability to manage all elements of our business and make the right judgments and write estimates for accounting purposes and make our best estimates on loss picks. And hopefully have a bias towards being conservative that gives us a margin of error to deal with in case anything goes wrong. So that's what I would say. So what do you mean by skepticism? Meyer Shields : So let me use asbestos as an example of that. Because I'm not in any way questioning the competence. But we've over the past few years, we've had adverse development and the question was whether maybe you should take a bigger slug. And clearly, you were expecting a smaller - you were expecting claims to decline. I'm wondering whether maybe that approach - in retrospect, obviously, that approach didn't capture everything. But I'm wondering whether there's something in the I guess the outlook or the underlying culture that - culture is the wrong word. But just the approach that should maybe say okay, instead of expecting things to work out more favorably, maybe they won't. Chris Swift : Yes, that is a unique set of facts. So I take your point. And as I said before in one of the questions, you ought to take away the real message from the UK transaction is we put a piece of legacy P&C runoff behind us, that we're always challenging ourselves of how we can continue to take some of the noise out of our results. But on an economic basis, right? We've always talked about balancing the economics and noise. And this is a tough issue from a litigation perspective of how people attack the exposures that our customers have had related to asbestos. So we will always challenge our assumptions and make our best views. And I know we haven't had a stellar track record there, but we will continue to challenge ourselves, Meyer. Meyer Shields : Okay, no, that's helpful and I appreciate it. On a more sort of granular basis, can we get the current accident - the original and current accident year auto picks for 2015 for the back half of the year? Chris Swift : Well, let us look for them, see if we have them in front. 2015, you said? Meyer Shields : Right. Just so we can sort of model the year-over-year change in the back half of this year. Beth Bombara : Meyer, with the reserve additions that we made in the first quarter and the second quarter, the 2015 auto combined ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development, is 103.5. And I think Jonathan may have the original one for the full year. I believe it was 99.0 for full year 2015 at the end of 2015. So there's been about 4.5 points of deterioration during the first half of this year. I would also note that given the actions we took in first quarter, the 2014 accident year was - at the end of 2015, it was 97.1 and that deteriorated 1.5 points during 2016, so that's now 98.6.v Meyer Shields : Okay, that's perfect. That's what I was looking for. Thank you so much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes in the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is open. Ian Gutterman : Thanks. I guess I have an auto question, but just first another sort of big topic that's come up recently, Chris, is these sort of incessant every-few-months M&A rumors. And I know you've talked about it before, so I'm not going to ask you to sort of rehash what you said in the past. But from a practical standpoint, is it having any impact on your business? I guess that's what my concern is. Like are you getting too many questions from agents or clients wondering what the Company's future is? Is that a distraction at all or not an issue? Chris Swift : It really is not, Ian. So you can't control rumors, but it is not distracting us at all. Ian Gutterman : Okay, good. That was my main concern. On the auto to sort of follow up a little bit of what Mike was asking a you minutes ago, I feel like agency auto, specifically the agency side, has been struggling ever since I've known the Company, which unfortunately is a long time. And I feel every few years, we talk about sort of what do you need to see to affirm your commitment to that business. And I guess I still struggle with - again, the AARP business is a great business. But the pure agency side, does it feel like you are being adversely selected because you don't have the same sort of scale or systems that other people do? And we've seen obviously one competitor that that's made a lot of improvements in their cost structure to be able to low pricing and others who have focused a lot on the rating systems since they do better in that. It just feels like the business isn't necessarily at the scale it needs to be to keep up with the top players. And at what point do you maybe need to take a harder look at whether it's best in someone else's hands and you can redeploy that capital into growing things like Middle Market, where that maybe you are better fit? Chris Swift : Ian, it's Chris. Let me frame the issue and then ask Doug for his perspective, too. Yes, you are right. We see the same trends as far as performance. And I would say what the real strategy is right now is look, we are committed to our independent agents for all aspects of our business, while we obviously market to AARP members on a direct basis. I think what Ray and his team are really focused on right now is finding those independent agents that are aligned to our value proposition over the longer term. And our value proposition is really - my simple way of thinking about it is a product that offers real benefits to its - to the insureds that is appropriately priced and that we just don't want to be spreadsheeted against the lowest carrier. So very proud in what our brand stands for, our claims capabilities, our empathy, particularly in the mature segment. Because I think we've earned the right to be a carrier in that segment. I think what it really means, though, is how do we transition to that as quickly as possible? And you've heard the litany of activities that Doug and team are focused on, whether it be commission actions, whether it be appointments. So we are pruning the agents that are aligned to our value structure. We want to support them. We want to grow with them. So I think that is a more tailored a strategy, particularly in the mature market that we are executing right now. Doug Elliot : Chris, I think you've done a good job. We've shared the numbers in the past, and Ian, I don't disagree with the question. But we feel like we've taken pretty significant action, I think, about our core preferred agency group now focused around 2,000 to 2,500 agents. That's a very different number than we were trying to manage two and three and four years ago. I think about our preferred scale, we are looking at our commissions. We had 6,500 agency locations 6 months ago that had our preferred schedule. That number is down to closer to 2,500. So we are looking at expenses. I think we're working all the levers. I do feel like the book is big enough that we can be successful there. It is a terrific complement to what we do on the Direct side with AARP. And you know we are leaning into the mature component of that agency book. So I'm not giving up. I see progress underneath, but very disappointed that the first six months of 2016 have played out the way they have. Ian Gutterman : I understand, I understand. But I'm going to sneak one last one in for you, Doug. You mentioned some increasing competition in group. Anything you can elaborate on there? Doug Elliot : You know, in the disability lines, we've just felt our hit ratios - meaning success ratios - have not been where they had been the prior couple of years. So as we look at the first half of 2016, I would've expected a few more wins in that category. We see a little bit more challenging times in what I would describe as the middle market area of group. So in that 500 to 2,000 life case, our success has not been the same as it has been in the national account space. I know we are stronger. We've had a traditionally very strong platform in national, but we have leaned into that middle market hard with resource and talent the last couple of years. So I think that is the ground. And it actually reminds me a bit of the P&C side, where I see a lot of the softer market conditions in that middle market of P&C. I see the same area in LTD and disability. Sabra Purtill : I believe we have one more question in the queue, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes on the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your line is open. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Hartford. Two follow-ups on personal lines and the UK sale. On personal lines, it sounded like, Doug, most of the actions you are taking were on the agency side of the business, either direct agency or Agency AARP relationships. Am I right to infer there is a greater hit in the personal and your agency book than AARP, or did I misinterpret that? Doug Elliot : Bob, there certainly are agency actions directly aligned with that side. But when I think about our pricing, our product segmentation, claim, operational, Open Road, those all have opportunity to impact favorably our Direct business as well. So don't think of this as an agency-only strategy. We are working both sides and have room for improvement on both halves. Bob Glasspiegel : But so agency is not being pressured more than AARP and auto? You don't give out the by-line underwriting. Doug Elliot : Yes, we don't disclose that. I will tell you that the loss ratio - well, the combined ratio overall performance difference in those segments is in the neighborhood of 10 points. So there is more concentrated effort to get agency auto back closer to our long-term target. And there is a further distance to make that happen. But we are working across our book of business to try and to make sure our overall auto book is also where it needs to be long term. Bob Glasspiegel : Okay. If I could sneak one more in. On the UK sale, what percentage of your asbestos and environmental reserves does that book represent? And I think you said it didn't impact - the sale didn't impact the Q2 A&E charges, so there was none for those lines in this segment. Beth Bombara : Yes. That's correct. There was none of the reserve charge that we took this quarter was related to those exposures. We did provide details, both in our 10-Q and our slides, on exactly what reserves are included. But just to give you those numbers, for the asbestos reserves, there is about $210 million of exposure associated with the UK sale that would go away from that column. And then about $42 million in environmental reserves. And then we've got other reserves, obviously, in the all other category of about $243 million that will also transfer. So in total, it's a little under $500 million in that reserve. Bob Glasspiegel : And it won't change survival ratios? I assume they are - the payout trends are similar to your other book - other reserves? Beth Bombara : Yes. It might have them come down just a little bit, but really no significant impact. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today and your interest in The Hartford. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow-up with us. We wish you all a good weekend and good luck with the rest of earnings season. Goodbye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Chris Swift : Thanks Sabra, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with our overall third-quarter results. In commercial lines and group benefits, performance was strong and demonstrates focus on maintaining margins albeit disciplined about growth in a sustained competitive environment. I'm also pleased with the actions we\u2019ve been taking to improve personal auto performance. In addition, the balance sheet and capital generation remains strong and last evening we announced the board authorized a new 1.3 billion equity repurchase plan as well as a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. Starting with personal lines, we are intently focused on improving auto profitability. We\u2019re implementing a range of initiatives including aggressive rate actions that address sustained higher loss cost trends caused by a multitude of factors including increased miles driven, speed and distracted driving. We are also addressing profitability through adjustments to our new class plan, more focused marketing and determination of unprofitable agency relationships. I have deep confidence in the personal lines\u2019 leadership team and in their strategy to improve performance. Though results remain challenged in the third quarter, we will steadily improve profitability in personal auto and expect to see better returns in 2017 as the actions we take work their way through the book. In commercial lines, the underlying combined ratio excludes catastrophes in prior development was very strong at 90.0. This would represent a full point improvement over the prior year. I\u2019m pleased with our competitive positioning across commercial lines and with our ability to defend the margins we worked so hard to achieve. The team is successfully balancing underwriting discipline with profitable growth in selected markets. In small commercial, we\u2019re generating new business growth at very attractive returns. For the quarter, written premiums grew 5% and the underlying complaint ratio was 86.8. The small commercial market has garnered a lot of attention recently with peers and new entrants launching first time initiatives. The Hartford has been the leader in the space, we have been investing in small commercial for over three decades and our end-to-end capabilities are the industry's goal standard. We continue to enhance our innovative approaches through customer experience, digital and the use of data analytics all backed by our industry-leading customer service centers. We are committed to innovating to advance our market position. Consistent with last quarter, competitive conditions in the larger end of the market such as middle market and national accounts remain challenging. Our primary focus is to maintain margins with selective topline growth. This quarter, we had continued success in that goal with improved underlying combined ratio on a relatively flat premium base. In middle market, retentions remained strong as we work to retain our best accounts in our 93.1 underlying combined ratio improved more than 0.5 over the prior year. New business however declined 15% reflecting pricing and underwriting disciplines. Outside of our P&C businesses group benefits generated strong profitability with a 5.6% core earnings margin and improved disability loss ratio and good sales in a competitive marketplace. At Talcott, the business continues to perform consistently and in line with our expectations while mutual funds posted another solid quarter. And third-quarter investment results benefited from stronger limited partnership income. Excluding partnership returns, the solid underlying performance of our investment portfolio reflects measured risk-taking and disciplined investment decisions. We continue to make progress in executing our strategy to invest capital in our businesses to expand capabilities. We closed the acquisition of Maxum in July and the team's expertise in the E&S market is already paying dividends in broadening our commercial lines and risk capabilities. We also expanded the mutual funds platform. We entered into smart-beta ETF space through the acquisition of Lattice Strategies and further broadened our actively managed investment offerings through a relationship with Schroder. I spent a lot of time on the road this year meeting with and listening to our distribution partners. As I reflect on those conversations what really stands out is their support of our consistent approach to new and renewable business along with their trust and confidence. And they like the fact that we are becoming a broader and deeper risk player. This is encouraging thing back from our partners whom share my confidence in the Hartford's ability to execute given the fundamental strength of our platform and the improvements we've made to the organization. As we close out the year, we will remain focused on maintaining margins and commercial lines and group benefits and improving profitability in personal auto. Though we continue to face industry and market headwinds, we have the skills, experience and commitment to successfully carry out our strategy and to create shareholder value. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you Chris and good morning. Overall this was a solid quarter for our property and casualty and group benefits businesses. We posted strong results in both commercial lines and group benefits where we continue to effectively navigate very competitive market conditions. In personal lines there are positive signs that our pricing actions and underwriting initiatives are gaining traction even as frequency trends remain elevated. In the third quarter, personal lines posted core earnings of 25 million, up 8 million from third quarter last year. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior period development was 96.1 increasing 0.5 point from last year. This is primarily the result of higher auto loss, liability loss costs partially offset by a decrease in expenses. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were 37 million, down 31 million from third quarter 2015. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 79.6 improved 2.8 points versus last year, driven by favorable expenses. The underlying loss ratio was in line with prior year but running above our expectations for the quarter. Year-to-date performance in this line has been very solid as we continue to take rate increases and effectively manage our underwriting execution. In auto, the underlying combined ratio of 103.1 was 1.5 points higher than we posted in third quarter last year. This reflects the 2016 emergence of increased loss cost trends partially offset by lower expenses. The underlying auto loss ratio for third quarter 2016 is slightly elevated when compared to 2015 after adjusting for the unfavorable 2016 accident year development which we recorded in the first half of this year. For the 2016 accident quarter frequency trend was approximately 3%. Our first and second quarter 2016 loss picks have continued to hold. Severity continued to increase slightly on the 2015 accident year but remain within our estimates and we had no prior year development for auto this quarter. We expect the substantial rate, underwriting, agency management and new business actions we have implemented to being earning their way into the book of business in the coming quarters. We are beginning to see early signs of expected improvement in our business metrics and given persistent trends are moving aggressively on multiple fronts. For example, we continue to accelerate our rate filings. We now expect to achieve nearly 240 million of annualized rate increases on the auto line based on our current in-force business. This is 30 million higher than our projection as of second quarter 2016 and double what we achieved in 2015. We expect written pricing in the fourth quarter to approach 9%. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customer's we actually renew. We expect the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business to drive auto margin improvement in both 2017 and 2018. New business marketing has been reduced in many jurisdictions until the increased rates are in effect in the market. In AARP Direct auto, new business was down 36%. AARP Agency auto was down 29% and other agency auto was down 45%. We've also reduced our direct marketing spend, lowered operational cost and reduced commissions which contributed to a 3 point improvement in expense ratio. As a result of these profit improvement actions, written premium growth for both AARP Direct and AARP Agency was flat for the third quarter 2016. Other agency was down 20% consistent with our strategy to shift our business mix toward AARP members and our more highly partnered agents. Retention in our AARP channels was relatively stable, a positive outcome as we increase rates. The revised 2016 full-year underlying auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 that we shared with you last quarter is under pressure from continuing frequency trends. We were expecting the rate of change in auto frequency to moderate in the second half of 2016 based on the elevated levels that emerged in the second half of 2015. Given higher-than-expected auto frequency trends this quarter, we now expect the full-year underlying auto combined ratio to be at the higher end of our range. Achieving the 2016 full-year underlying combined ratio of 93 to 94 for total personal lines will be dependent on auto frequency trends and homeowner losses in the fourth quarter. Although auto frequency has been elevated longer than we expected, my confidence grows every day that we are moving in the right direction to restore profitability in this business. Shifting over to commercial lines, we had a strong quarter with core earnings of 247 million, up 31 million from third quarter 2015. The increase is largely attributable to higher net investment income and increased underwriting gain. The combined ratio of 93.9 improves 0.6 versus prior year, due primarily to less unfavorable prior year development and a lower expense ratio partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Workers compensation continues to perform very well. This is our largest line of business, our strong margins improved slightly in the current accident year and we continue to manage this line very closely remaining vigilant on pricing and lost cost trends. Commercial auto on the other hand continues to be under pressure across the industry and we increased our 2016 accident year loss ratio estimates to reflect the ongoing lost cost increases. We also recorded 18 million pre-tax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in small commercial in accident year 2015. Auto was a relatively small line for us representing approximately 10% of commercial TNC premium. We are achieving our highest written price increases in this line and continuing to take aggressive underwriting actions. The commercial lines expense ratio was favorable in the quarter improving by 1 point versus third quarter 2015. However, we expect our full year ratio to be in line with prior year. On the specialty, we are pleased with our renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines at 2% for the quarter essentially stable over the past five quarters. To achieve a few points of price in this competitive environment is a positive reflection of the solid discipline exhibited by our front-line teams. Our strong performance in small commercial continued this quarter. We had excellent result in both the top and bottom line. The underlying combined ratio of 86.8 was consistent with last year. Excluding the results of the Maxum acquisition which closed during the quarter, the underlying combined ratio actually improved by 0.2 point versus third quarter 2015. This reflects an improvement in workers compensation and a lower expense ratio offset by deterioration in auto and package results. Written premiums in small commercial was up 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Maxum represents approximately 1 point of this growth. Retentions continue to be strong and new business excluding Maxum was up 5% to 135 million as we continue to execute in a very competitive market. Moving to middle market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 93.1 improving 0.7 point from third quarter 2015. This was primarily due to favorable workers compensation margins and lower expenses partially offset by higher auto loss cost and unfavorable non-catastrophe property experience. Middle market written premium in the quarter was down 0.7 point compared to prior year. New business of 99 million was down 15% from last year as we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in the face of competitive market conditions. Specialty commercial had another very strong quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.4 points versus prior year driven by strong margins across national accounts, bond and financial products. Specialty commercial written premium was down 4% compared to third quarter 2015. In both years the written premium is affected by audit premiums and several retro accounts. Normalizing for these items, written premium is up modestly and specialty commercial driven by solid new business in national accounts. We continue to navigate these markets effectively and I'm pleased with our pricing discipline and overall results. In group benefits, we had a very solid quarter with core earnings of 51 million, up 4 million from prior year resulting in a core earnings margin of 5.6%. The increase in core earnings was driven primarily by higher premiums, lower disability losses and lower expenses partially offset by higher group life losses. The group life loss ratio of 80% for third quarter 2016 was driven by higher-than-expected mortality claims from larger policy values. We've experienced similar trends in the first half of 2016 and are evaluating underlying factors and appropriate actions going forward. Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% for the quarter, overall book persistency on our employer group block of business continues to hold around 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were 61 million for the quarter, flat to third-quarter 2016. We continue to feel competitive pressures particularly in long-term disability. As with our property and casualty businesses, we remain disciplined on pricing and underwriting successfully differentiating our offering on superior service and claims capabilities. In summary, this is a solid quarter for our businesses. Commercial lines and group benefits delivered strong results demonstrating our commitment to disciplined pricing, strong retention and maintaining margins as we continue to experience competitive market conditions. In personal lines, we\u2019re pleased with the early traction our initiatives are gaining. Pricing, underwriting and agency management actions are working their way through the book of business to address elevated lost trends and restore underwriting profitability in personal auto. And finally, I'd like to welcome our new Maxum teammates to the Hartford. Maxum's capabilities are perfectly aligned with our strategy to become a broader and deeper risk player in the marketplace and I look forward to working very closely with this team on the journey ahead. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the remaining segment, the investment portfolio and capital management before we turn the call over to questions. Mutual funds core earnings were down 1 million from third quarter of 2015 due to 3% reduction in investment management fees. Total AUM was up about 6% from a year ago due to a 9% increase in mutual fund AUM which was partially offset by a 6% decrease in Talcott AUM. The decrease in investment management fees reflects the continued shift to lower fee mutual funds consistent with industry trends. Our team has been proactively responding to the changing mutual fund market. As Chris mentioned, our acquisition of Lattice add smart data exchange traded funds to our portfolio line-up. This is a fast growing market with positive net flows and Lattice is an innovative platform that we can grow and also use to launch actively managed ETFs in the future. In addition, last week we added a new sub advisor relationship with the adoption of ten mutual funds managed by Schroder Investment Management with about 3 billion in AUM. These funds which have been rebranded as the Hartford Schroder funds broaden our platform and expand our offerings particularly in international and emerging markets. Talcott continues to perform well focused on running of the annuity books efficiently and effectively while returning capital to the holding company. Core earnings decreased this quarter by 3 million compared with third quarter 2015 but were well ahead of our outlook due to very strong returns on limited partnerships both from improved hedge fund performance and higher private equity returns. Excluding the impact of limited partnerships, the decrease in Talcott\u2019s core earnings was due to the decline in fee income as the book continued to run off offset in large part by reduced expenses. This quarter, full surrender activity on an annualized basis was 7.4% for variable annuities and 5.4% for fixed annuities. Talcott DAC unlock charge was modest this quarter as adjustments to variable annuity lapsed and market assumptions largely offset the impact of writing of the remaining DAC on our fixed annuity book. The fixed annuity DAC write-off was caused by the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment resulting in lower expected growth profits on the book. As we said in July, during the third quarter, Talcott paid a 250 million extraordinary dividend to a holding company completing our expected 750 million dividend plan for 2016. In 2017, we expect to request dividend in the range of 500 to 600 million. Investment results were strong this quarter with a sharp improvement in limited partnership returns. Limited partnerships investment income totaled 93 million before tax this quarter compared to 22 million before tax in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter's annualized investment returns for LPs was about 15% which is well above our 6% outlook and has pushed our year-to-date annualized limited partnership return back up to 7%. Hedge fund performance was slightly positive compared to losses in third quarter 2015. And private equity income was exceptionally strong including a significant valuation write-up for one of the partnerships this quarter. Excluding limited partnerships, the before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% this quarter slightly lower than 4.2% last year due to the combined impact of lower reinvestment rates and lower income from non-routine items. Given the low level of current interest rates we continue to expect portfolio yield compression in the fourth quarter and into 2017. Turning to credit performance, our investment portfolio remains highly rated and well diversified. Credit experience was good during the quarter with total impairments and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of 14 million before tax, down from 39 million in third-quarter 2015. In 2015, we had a higher level of credit losses including intent to sell impairments on some floating rate and non-investment grade securities including some energy related exposures. To conclude on earnings, third quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.06, a 23% increase from third quarter 2015. Excluding prior developments and limited partnerships core earnings per diluted share rose by 7% over last year or $0.06 cents per share. Catastrophe results were largely consistent with third-quarter 2015 with no major hurricane losses in either period. For Hurricane Matthew which was a fourth quarter event we currently estimate losses of 40 to 60 million before tax which would consume a large portion if not all of our fourth quarter CAP budget of 60 million before tax. The 12-month core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 9.1% and the P&C core earnings ROE was 11%. Both of these metrics include the unfavorable prior development on personal auto and A&E reported in the first six months of 2016. Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share excluding AOCI rose 6% from a year ago resulting in total shareholder value creation including dividend over the past 12 months of 8.4%. Finally, during the quarter we repurchased $350 million of stock. During October, we repurchased 2 million shares for $85 million leaving approximately 195 million remaining under the 2014 to 2016 equity plan of $4.375 billion. Yesterday, we announced a new equity repurchase authorization and an increase in our quarterly dividend. The new equity repurchase authorization is $1.3 billion and is effective October 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017. We expect to use the new authorization ratably over 2017. The quarterly dividend was raised by $0.02 or 10% to $0.23 per share. As you know, reducing debt and improving our debt service ratios have both been important objectives over the last few years. This month, we repay 275 million of maturing debt consistent with our previously announced plan. In 2017, we intent to repay 416 million of senior notes in March, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. Our 2017 capital plan was developed with the expectation that 2017 dividend and holding company cash flows in total will be about at the same level as in 2016. While Talcott dividend will be 500 to 600 million, which is down from the 750 million we received this year, we expect this reduction will be offset by higher dividends from our other subsidiaries and other holding company resources. To conclude, this quarter's results were strong and as Doug discussed our profitability improvement initiatives with personal auto are well underway. We continue to generate very strong margins in commercial lines and group benefits and we are growing profitably in small commercial our top performing business. Finally, with disciplined execution year-to-date investment results remain very good and along with generally favorable equity market levels have helped Talcott deliver good bottom line results. With strong earnings and capital generation, we were very pleased to be able to announce our capital management plans for 2017. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Michelle we have about 30 minutes for Q&A so if you can give the instruction for the polling for the Q&A and then we will start. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Just a couple on personal lines on the auto. So I think you guys mentioned that severity and frequency were bolstered up 3% year over year. I'm just wondering if the actions that you've taken so far contemplate things continue and they get a little bit worse or still running at these levels or should we think about the actions you've taken - do those more assumed in 2017, 2018 do I have a kind of what\u2019s been like more of a historical normal in terms of frequency especially? Doug Elliot : Ryan good morning this is Doug. Let me take that question and try to pull apart a few of the pieces. First thing is that we were a little disappointed that our frequency in the third-quarter was a little higher than we expected to be particularly given what we thought were ever going to be favorable trends against the 2015 patterns in the back half of the year. As we lean into fourth quarter, obviously we will watch those three months carefully. Encouraged by what we are seeing in October but need to finish the year strong for 2016 to complete itself. As we think about 2017, we\u2019ll share more when we get the January but I will say this, it looks to us like we are in an environment where loss trends don't look like averages over the past ten years. So we are anticipating an abnormal environment hoping that it isn\u2019t as abnormal as the last two years have been but we will talk more about that with more detail in January. Ryan Tunis : And then my follow-up I guess is probably a little bit more of a modeling one around auto. But just thinking about the momentum on the expense ratio there? I mean the fact that that's improved a lot direct marketing costs have come out. I guess lower bonuses should that continue to come down over the next few quarters or it is sort of way you\u2019re running now reflect all the actions you've announced or have planned? Doug Elliot : Two things I would say, first is, clearly we are taking extraordinary change leverage if you will based on our revised open road plans. So, yes, we did some things in the third quarter that were a bit outsized compared to our run rate. So yes, you need to step that back to get a more normal run rate going forward, but we\u2019re continuing to match our pricing adequacy, our view about profitability with our marketing strategies and they are incredibly correlated. So we will continue to do that quarter-by-quarter. This is an approach that we are keenly focused on margins and the margins have to be in line for us to be kind of ramping up marketing efforts. So I hope to see a different day soon, but we\u2019ll work hard at that. The other thing I just want to say as well, I think you've seen and hopefully heard in my script, we\u2019ve worked hard on the rate change activity and many of you that have looked inside the state filings have seen the advancements of that strategy. I gave you a forward look into the fourth quarter, that's evidence of really what's happening at the desk level. So as our filing momentum continues, we expect fourth quarter to show nine point surprising activity that is very reflective of our aggressive approach to getting on top of these loss trends. Ryan Tunis : Okay. And I guess just a follow-up real quick to that, I think you also mentioned, it's not just renewal rates, it\u2019s also mix change. I guess when you think about longer-term getting back towards the 96 to 96.5 [indiscernible] how much of that do you think really relies on getting renewal rate versus just kind of, maybe undoing some of the things that happened a year ago, in terms of just improving I guess the mix of the book? Doug Elliot : Yes. I don't want to give you an exact definitive answer, because I\u2019m not sure there is one, but I will say this. There are clearly positive signs that are going to manifest inside the aggressive rate actions offsetting some of the trends that we are seeing in our book as well. I\u2019m also encouraged by the number of levers that we\u2019re working in our other agency and in our other channels. So as we think about kind of this roll forward into 2017 and 18, there are going to be benefits, important benefits on both sides of that equation, but I want you to know that based on my pricing comments this morning, we are leaning into what we need to do to address the costs and the loss trends that are in the marketplace today. Chris Swift : Brian, it\u2019s Chris. The only color I would add for you is, remember, we are optimistic about the AARP book, its relationship, our knowledge in that market and so consistent with, Doug, I'm not going to give you a precise formula, but there is a substantial amount of improvement that will come from a retrenchment and a focus on our core, our core AARP, our abilities to market to them in a direct and an efficient fashion, while using the channel for those customers that want to go through an agent and really shut down some of the other agency non-member agency as we call activities where we\u2019ve tried to grow a little too fast in the past. So I would not underestimate the mix comment that you said, because it will improve the results over that two-year period of time. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Nannizzi : Thanks so much. I guess just, Doug, just one question just on personal auto, when you talk about improvement in \u201817 from the actions you\u2019ve taken so far, what are your assumptions around loss trends. You mentioned you were a little bit surprised with 4Q sort of holding flat and not improving. Are you optimistic in your outlook or are you taking into consideration in that view of improving trends and profitability, what we saw here so far in the fourth quarter? Doug Elliot : Thanks, Mike. The loss trend discussion is an interesting one today, right, so we\u2019re spending a lot of time in our day that we also are spending a lot of time looking at industry, the fast-track data that I know all of you look at. So as we look forward, we have expectations based on the actions we are taking that we\u2019re going to see improving signs in our book of business and based on some of the early progress across both retention of our existing book and also the new business we\u2019re putting on, we feel good that we are turning the dial in a favorable direction on things we can control relative from our own loss trends. If you step back from that and you look at fast-track data and you see aggregate severity and frequency in this industry over the past seven, eight quarters in a very different spot. So our lens into \u201817, \u201818 has changed a bit over the last couple of quarters, as has our approach to rate change. So they are directly correlated. It\u2019s the reason we're ramping up, it\u2019s a reason that our rate activity in \u201816 is 2X what it was in \u201815, but Mike, I would say that we are willing to be mobile and agile and adjust to what we see going forward. We do think it will be a bit more tempered in \u201817, but at the moment, we need to see better signs across the industry that auto experience is going to demonstrate that. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. Thanks for that. And then you mentioned marketing spend as a lever in personal lines, can you talk about how much room you have there as a lever if you want to, if that's an area where you decide you want to pull back further, how much sort of juice is there in that operating lever? Chris Swift : Michael, it\u2019s Chris. I would say we\u2019ve been fairly aggressive in polling that lever over the last two quarters. How much more we do obviously is a function of where we see the ability to market on a more targeted basis, state basis, where we think there is still opportunities to acquire business at acceptable rates. So I'm not going to give you a precise formula, but I mean it's been cut back quite substantially already. We feel good about the level where it is right now from a run rate side, particularly as we head into \u201817, but if there is any additional discomfort, what we are seeing, it is a lever that we could continue to modify and pull. So if we are running pro forma about 50% of what our historical rate has been, we still theoretically have $0.50 on those additional dollars to pull. Michael Nannizzi : Great. Thanks. And then just one last one if I could, just there has been some activity in the space on the acquisition side with rates sort of lifting up a little bit here recently, can you just talk about Talcott and the potential there or any potential interest from third parties, and if that's something that you are, you would consider more specifically now than maybe previously? Thanks. Chris Swift : Thank you, Michael. I think you know the stock answer. We're not going to comment upon rumors or speculation. So, but I could share with you maybe just a framework that probably many of you have heard over the years in what our strategy and goals with Talcott were. I mean, really, we put that block into run-off five years ago, really with the idea of reducing risk and policyholders\u2019 liabilities reliability over time. We wanted to return excess capital to the holding company and we always wanted to meet our customer commitments. So I think over the last five years that it\u2019s played out exactly as we would have wanted. The book is - the liability side of the book has been reduced over 50% and Talcott\u2019s provided the holding company with a good deal of capital that has allowed us to manage in the most efficient way. So as we look forward, we\u2019re perfectly comfortable running this off over a longer period of time, but myself, Beth and we've always said, we'd always consider a permanent solution if it was really truly permanent and that usually in our vernacular means a legal entity sale. So I think in the future, we will always be prudent in exploring opportunities, but I wouldn't foreshadow a lean one way or another at this point in time. I mean it's running off as we\u2019ve planned and if there are solutions out there that make economic sense for us, that would be acceptable with the regulators that take care of our customers and employees, we would explore that. Operator : The next question comes from Randy Binner from FBR. Your line is open. Randy Binner : Hey, great. Thanks. I'll ask a couple more on Talcott, one, with the run-off on contract counts, the 10% and 5% numbers, they\u2019re still good, they\u2019re slowing down a little bit, do you have any further initiatives planned to accelerate the movement of contracts out of the block? Beth Bombara : Sure, Randy. This is Beth. I\u2019ll take that. At the current time, no large initiatives like the ones that you\u2019ve seen in the past. I think, as I\u2019ve commented on before, the team is always looking at things that we can do and I think we've done some of those larger initiatives which obviously favorably impacted the surrender activity over the last couple of years. And now I see it as continued sort of tweaks on that process, but we do not have a contract initiative underway at the present time. Randy Binner : Okay. And then on the 500 to 600 requests planned for 2017, can you break that out between what\u2019s kind of operating free cash flow versus just capital release as the required capital goes down overtime? And then what the timing of that would be, up in \u201817, would be, I think this year, it came up more in the kind of the first half? Beth Bombara : Yes. So a couple of things and it\u2019s hard to parse out an exact number. If you go back to the comments that I made in July, when we look at absolute surplus generation during the course of the year, given where interest rates are, I would expect before consideration of the dividends that we took out during the course of 2016 that our statutory surplus would be a little bit lower than where we started because we do anticipate needing to post cash flow reserves in the fourth quarter. So even those through the nine months, we've seen an increase in surplus before dividends, we would expect most, if not all of that to go away as we go towards the end of the year. So when I think about the capital that we\u2019re taking out next year, it's really looking at what excess do we have under stress scenarios, how comfortable do we feel relative to the levels that that would mean that we\u2019re running Talcott at and based on that, I feel very comfortable with the range of 500 million to 600 million. As far as the timing over the course of \u201817, we haven't - and specifically on that, but I would expect that we would again not take it all out at once, probably take some out in the first part of the year and some in the second, but that timing is still to be determined. Randy Binner : Just the last one is did you provide an update on the RBC ratio down at Talcott as of now? Beth Bombara : No, we did not put an update in RBC ratio. I\u2019d say that the RBC ratio is getting a specific number. It continues to be very strong in these markets, in this market environment. Again, when we think about excess capital and ability to take dividend out, we\u2019re always looking at it in the stress. So to some extent, what the current RBC level is, it is not so much of an input for us as we think about the amount of capital that we can put to the holding company. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thank you. A couple of quick numbers question and one broader question for you. First, Doug, what was the impact on current year loss ratios in commercial lines from the increase in loss picks on the commercial art of business, I imagine there were some current year development? Doug Elliot : There was, Brian. It was about a half a point across all the commercial, the impact from our auto changes. Brian Meredith : Great. And the other quick numbers one, was the impact on reserve development for the Florida worker's comp reserve increased? Beth Bombara : So I will take that one, Brian. So as we looked at our reserve position at the end of the quarter and worker\u2019s comp, we did take into consideration the impact of those rulings and putting that in the mix along with some of the favorable trends that we've seen, really resulted in no real change needed to our overall carried reserves. Brian Meredith : Okay, great. And then my last question, Doug, I'm just curious, we've seen a tick-up in medical costs inflation this year at least recently. Are you seeing any signs at all that in the worker's comp line yet? Doug Elliot : Brian, we are not, we're watching that very carefully and we\u2019re very pleased with our frequency and severity trends, very early in the accident year, but our 2016 workers comp book is very good shape, frequencies continue to be flat to down slightly in our medical and our indemnity severities are in pretty good shape. So we are not seeing the blips there yet. Chris Swift : Brian, it\u2019s Chris. Just one point both Doug and I get a monthly report from our investment and management, just on detailed inflation activity. So it is something, as he said, we watch closely. I think also the important thing to remind everyone is no matter what the current trends are, I mean, what we\u2019d put upon the books has a long-term inflation trend associated with it. And that\u2019s in the 6% to 7% range, so to the extent that that trend is not needed, then obviously that creates successes, but to the extent it\u2019s needed, no, it\u2019s already there and built into our reserving philosophy. Brian Meredith : Great. And just lastly quickly, Beth, could the DOL feature [indiscernible] Talcott as we look Q4? Beth Bombara : So we are continuing to stay close to our partners on that to understand that. I think that it could have some impact as financial advisors look to implement the rules and think about what advice they give to their customers. At the present time, we\u2019re not expecting a significant change, but it\u2019s something that we will look at and monitored very closely, but wouldn't surprise me if we saw a little bit of a slowdown, potentially. Operator : Your next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks, good morning. If I can start on the mutual funds business, I guess the press release talks about higher expenses related to Lattice, are those expenses associated with the acquisition or the operation business? Beth Bombara : It's a little bit of both, Meyer. So obviously there were some costs relative to the acquisition and then just as we bring that platform onto ours, we will see some uptick on expenses. Meyer Shields : Okay. And then within P&C, I guess can you talk about how Maxim is performing in terms of premium volumes and margins compared to expectations? Doug Elliot : Meyer, this is Doug. It\u2019s very early days. It\u2019s just been what is really 60 days. No progress or aberration to speak of, so it's been a well performing underwriting group in its extended history. We\u2019re pleased about having them on board, but in the third quarter, there wasn't anything really to speak of it that would be a pattern for Maxim. Meyer Shields : Okay. And then last question if I can, can you give us an update on the agency count, within I guess the non-AARP book? Doug Elliot : The agency count has not moved a lot since the last time we spoke, I think just over 10,000 was the number of locations I think we shared with you last. So maybe a couple of tuning adjustments we made since then. I know that we made a few more moves in Florida since the second quarter call, but substantially it's the same book of business and same agents, we\u2019re just working our way through our changes. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Alex Scott from Evercore. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi, I just had one quick one on Talcott. I know you mentioned the writedowns this quarter, and for 4Q, some of the statutory work, just thinking about GAAP reserves, I know some of them are kind of how it is embedded derivatives, some of them are not, is there any contemplation when exit value in those reserves, I guess how should we think about that impacting 4Q? Beth Bombara : So, as I sit here and think about our GAAP reserves, I think you\u2019re asking about for fourth quarter, not a lot of changes that we\u2019d anticipate relative to sort of the annual assumption updates that we've looked at in the fourth quarter. There hasn't been a lot of change in those expectations. So sitting here today, I\u2019m not expecting that we would see a significant impact from the fourth quarter review of our assumptions on a GAAP basis. Operator : And your next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : Thanks and good money. Beth, the $1.3 billion of buybacks in 2017, I think that's slightly above what the street was kind of expecting going into the year, and it also feels like you kind of pulled forward the discussion of that at this point of the year. So is there anything else you can tell us about in terms of the decision that led to that amount of the timing? Beth Bombara : So, Jay, really as we looked at our holding company requirements and the cash flows that we have and the dividends that we\u2019d be taking out of the subsidiaries and looked at that in total, it felt like a very reasonable number to us and generally kind of in line with what we did this year. As far as the timing of the announcement, we've always talked about announcing our 2017 plans as we came towards the end of the year and announcing that now and having that authorization obviously does give us the opportunity to be opportunistic in the fourth quarter, given that our previous authorization was running down, so that was really the thought process there relative to getting that authorization done now. Jay Gelb : Okay. Where does that put you or put the company from a debt to capital standpoint, relative to your long-term targets, also taking into account the debt running off in 2017? Beth Bombara : Yes. So when we look at both what the debt that we paid off this month and our expectation for the maturity that we will repay in March, we are definitely marching down towards our longer-term targets and so we\u2019ve always talked about sort of being in the low-20s and obviously both of those things are starting to put us there. So when I think back as to all of the actions we\u2019ve been taking on the debt front over the last several years and the way we have been going about it, feel very, very good about the progress that we\u2019re making and getting our debt stack to be more in-line with what our long-term expectations are. Jay Gelb : And then one last one on Talcott, there is clearly a lot of moving parts including the benefit of improved limited partnership returns in the third quarter, is it too early to ask about where you see kind of a normalized trend in Talcott\u2019s earnings in 2017? Beth Bombara : Yes. I would say let's wait until we get to our fourth quarter call when we talk a bit about expectations for 2017. I will remind you we did say that we will not be providing forward EPS guidance going forward, but we\u2019ll give some discussion on that, but the way I would have you think about it is obviously the limited partnership returns do provide some ups and downs as you look at the Talcott earnings over the course of the year and the majority of the sort of non-investment income return comes from the fees that are generated in the variable annuity book and we are pretty transparent in how that is running off, so I think if you use some of that, you get an expectations relative to run rate. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for joining us today and your interest in the Hartford. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to follow up with the Investor Relations team and we\u2019d like to wish you all a good weekend and happy Halloween. Goodbye. Operator : Thank you everyone, this conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Chris Swift : Thanks Sabra, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Hartford delivered strong results in commercial lines and group benefits despite sustain competition this quarter, while personal auto performance remains under pressure from loss cost trends. Doug will cover P&C and Group benefit results in a few minutes. And I wanted to highlight notable 2016 accomplishments that demonstrate the Hartford\u2019s underwriting discipline, effective execution and fundamental strengths of our platform. Commercial Lines delivered an exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.4 for the full year. The performance reflects the Hartford\u2019s best-in-class operating capabilities, strong market positions and disciplined underwriting. During the year, we also made progress on our strategy to broaden our risk appetite including entry into the E&S space with the acquisition of Maxum, expanded multinational capabilities through our partnership with AXA and the launch of a dedicated energy practice. Group Benefits delivered very good results for the full year, with the core earnings margin of 5.7%. We generated profitable growth in this segment reflecting strong sales, persistency and an improved loss ratio. We continue to execute on our Group Benefits growth strategy, enhancing the products suite with the addition of dental and vision for the small case market in new voluntary offerings. At Talcott, we continue to effectively and efficiently manage the runoff of the annuity blocks. Over the past two year, Talcott has returned $1.75 billion of capital to the holding company and we expect an additional $600 million in 2017. During 2016, we also addressed our legacy P&C exposures, which over the past few years has generated substantial adverse development. In July, we agreed to sell the runoff UK subsidiaries to Catalina, which we expect to close in the next few months. And at year-end, we reinsured the remaining legacy U.S. A&E liabilities to National Indemnity. While these actions resulted in modest book value dilution, we believe that the economic trade-off was well worth the near-term costs. Turning to Personal Lines, we are encouraged about moderating frequency, but remained concerned about bodily injury liabilities severity trends. As a consequence, we have strengthened prior year reserves and current accident year loss picks. In setting year-end calls for accident years 2015 and 2016, we placed higher weight on the most recently emerged bodily injury severity experience. We are intently focused on improving the profitability of this business. During the year we accelerated pricing, distribution and underwriting initiatives, resulting in a sharp drop in new business. Doug will provide you with more background on these actions and the progress we have achieved over this past year and I am confident that we will deliver improved results in 2017. Finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I\u2019d like to briefly cover our 2017 goals and expectations; Given the significant progress that Hartford has made over the past several years, I am confident in our ability to continue to perform well in an environment that we expect to remain challenging in 2017. We expect competition to remain robust for the coming year, with new entrance aggressively seeking in roads into our markets and peers fighting hard to retain their business. Technological, innovation and its potential effect on business models is also adding to the competitive intensity. In addition to these trends, 2017 presents higher regulatory, fiscal and macro-economic uncertainty. We are closely monitoring developments on capital health, including corporate tax reform, infrastructure spending in the possible repel or replacement of ACA and other changes in regulations all of which could impact us. With that backdrop, our strategy and focus in 2017 remain consistent. Hartford will prioritize long-term growth initiatives by investing in products, distribution, data and analytics and digital capabilities to provide more value to our agents and customers. These investments are aimed at providing us with critical insights and creating seamless interaction for customers across each of our businesses. Specifically, in 2017 we intent to maintain strong margins in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and to approve auto profitability. Our goal is to grow core earnings and book value per share, supported by continued capital management, including $1.3 billion of share repurchases and efficient debt management. We will continue to relentlessly scrutinize our expense structure, recognizing the importance of operating efficiency to competitive strength. In closing, I am proud of what the Hartford accomplished in 2016. We delivered strong financial results excluding auto, we returned $1.7 billion of equity to shareholders through repurchases in common dividends and continue to reduce debt outstanding and we significantly improved our operating capabilities and expanded our risk appetite. As we enter 2017, I am confident we are taking the right steps in our competitive markets as we continue to invest for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. We had an excellent 2016 in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits, particularly in light of the growing competitive dynamics we\u2019ve seen in these markets. Before I share details on our commercial businesses, let me get right into Personal Lines, where I only can describe 2016 auto loss trends as challenging and our financial performance as disappointing. For the fourth quarter, we posted a Personal Lines core loss of $17 million, cat losses for the quarter were $28 million, $7 million higher than in 2015. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior year development was 101.8, deteriorating 8.3 points from last year. This is primarily due to higher auto loss costs, partially offset by lower expenses. In homeowners the underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 74.7, deteriorated 2.3 points versus last year. The fourth quarter of 2015 experienced very favorable results compared to our longer term average. Overall our homeowners performance remains very solid and we continue to effectively manage rate needs and underwriting execution. In Personal Lines auto, we continue to see higher than expected overall loss cost trends. On the positive side, our current estimate of the change in frequency for the second and third quarters of 2016 has moderated versus our estimates 90 days ago. The change in bodily injury severity on the other hand has increased and continues to be an area of intense focus affecting both current and prior accident years. We recorded $20 million of prior year development in auto liability, primarily related to accident year 2015. We also increased the accident year 2016 loss ratio by approximately 2.5 points. Throughout the year we have been executing on substantial rate underwriting, agency management and new business actions. We have provided a new exhibit in our slide package that depicts our progress within segments of our auto book. We are measuring and managing our actions by state and customer cohort very closely. Let me provide commentary on three examples of the actions we\u2019re taking. First, written pricing in the fourth quarter was 9%, increasing 3 points from prior year and 2 points sequentially. I expect this number to increase an additional 1 to 2 points over the next few quarters. The earned premium impact of this rate is ultimately based on the customers we renew, but the combination of rate increases and mix change in the book of business will drive auto margin improvement in 2017 and 2018. Second, we reduced our new business marketing efforts in many jurisdictions until more adequate rates are in effect. Auto new business for the fourth quarter was down 58% with other agency off 64%. We are confident that we can return to new business growth once adequate rate levels are in placed to deliver our target returns. And third, lower new lower new business also results in reduced market expense and lower operational costs, which contributed to a 3.5 point improvement in the expense ratio for the fourth quarter. These actions and others will have a favorable effect on our loss ratio as higher average premium per policy and improved book of business mix are reflected in our earned premium. In commercial lines, we delivered $277 million of core earnings for the fourth quarter, on a combined ratio of 91.3, 3.2 points higher than 2015. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were $20 million higher than in \u201815, driven mainly by Hurricane Matthew and hail events in the Southwest. The fourth quarter also included 1.2 points of unfavorable prior year development versus 1 point of favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2015. The unfavorable prior year development was related to commercial auto and package business partially offset by prior year development and workers compensation being favorable. Commercial auto continues to be under pressure in our book of business and across the industry. We recorded $38 million pre-tax of prior year development to address severity trends, primarily in Small Commercial related to accident year 2015. We continue to achieve high single-digit written price increases in this line and have taken aggressive underwriting actions including enhanced referral criteria, resulting in lower retention and lower new business. We also recorded $15 million pre-tax of prior year development in the package business to address general liability severity trends and Small Commercial. The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 88.2 for the fourth quarter flat compared to 2015. This reflects improve current exiting year results in workers compensation, offset by weaker results in commercial auto. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 2% for both the full year and the fourth quarter holding steady throughout the year. I'm very pleased with this outcome, which reflects the underwriting rigor and discipline of our team in our competitive marketplace. Written premium of $1.7 billion for the quarter was up 3% from 2015, driven primarily by growth in Small Commercial including the acquisition of Maxum. Let me provide some detail of each of our commercial business units. Small Commercial had a solid fourth quarter to cap off an outstanding year. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86 up 0.9 point from 2015. Written premium for the fourth quarter grew by 7% driven by strong retentions and a $145 million of new business including Maxum. In middle market we demonstrated strong underwriting and pricing discipline delivering an underlying combined ratio of 88.9 for the fourth quarter improving 0.1 point from 2015. Written premium increased 1% based on solid retentions and new business production of a $133 million up 17% versus prior year. We are encouraged by these results, which we attribute to growing momentum on a number of strategic initiatives including our recently launched energy practice and our expanded multinational capability. We\u2019ve received very positive feedback from our agents and customers that we\u2019re delivering a well-integrated and comprehensive solution for their international needs. As a result we\u2019re finding opportunities to win new accounts based in the U.S. with international exposures that we might not have quoted in years prior. In Specialty Commercial the underlying combined ratio 94.8 for the fourth quarter improved from 98.1 in 2015. This was driven by strong performance in national accounts workers compensation, bond and financial products. Now let me turn to Group benefits. Core earnings for the fourth quarter increased to $59 million up from $40 million in 2015 with a core earnings margin of 6.5%. The Group disability loss ratio for the quarter deteriorated by 1.1 points compared to prior year due to higher severity, partially offset by pricing, as well as favorable incidence and recovery trends. The volatility we experienced in prior quarters in group life abated this quarter. The group life loss ratio improved 5.4 points versus 2015, largely due to favorable changes in reserve estimates. Looking at the top-line fourth quarter fully insured ongoing premium increased 2%, overall book persistency on our employer group block of business held in the high 80s for the year and fully insured ongoing sales were $43 million. Looking back on \u201816 we\u2019re pleased with the performance of our Commercial Lines and group benefit businesses. Particularly as we navigate these competitive markets. In personalized we\u2019re addressing our challenges with clear actions and our commitment to sustainable financial progress in 2017. Before I turn over to Beth let me offer a few comments on 2017. We expect that the market will be as competitive or more than the market we say in 2017. We remain committed to underwriting discipline and delivering strong margins only seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. In Commercial Lines we\u2019re focused on leveraging our expertise and tools to aggressively compete at the front line. We\u2019ll continue to improve our capabilities to better meet the changing demands of both customers and distributors who are seeking new product capabilities, increased access to our expertise and greater convenience in their service transactions. Due to the competitive markets in the marketplace, we expect that for lines of business with strong returns long-term loss cost trends will continue to outpace written pricing increases. As a result we expect an overall 2017 Commercial Lines combined ratio between 92.5 and 94.5 including 2.3 points of catastrophes. At the midpoint this is slightly higher than our results in 2016 yet still performing at attractive return levels. We will remain vigilant in addressing long-term loss cost trends, as well as taking immediate actions in areas that are under pressure. In first lines we will continue our disciplined actions to restore profitability in auto by continuing to execute on our pricing, underwriting and agency management actions. We\u2019re investing in capabilities to better harness data and thereby refine our underwriting and pricing analytics. We remain deeply committed to our long-term partnership with ARP with initiatives to deliver greater customer value and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. We expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 99 to 101 including 5.8 points of catastrophes. This implies in the auto combined ratio of 101 to 103 with approximately 1 point of catastrophes. Although clearly not a very target performance levels, this presents substantial progress towards that goal. In group benefits we're looking to drive growth in our core employer group offerings, as well as our voluntary product suite. January 2017 renewal retention is tracking consistent with prior year and January sales include a number of solid wins, but will be down from a year ago. We will add hospital indemnity in April of this year to our current voluntary lineup of disability flex, critical illness and accident. We expect group benefits performance to be relatively consistent with 2016, excluding a guarantee fund assessment for Penn Treaty. Our current estimate of this assessment is approximately $13 million after tax. For property and casualty and group benefits overall, we will continue to compete in an aggressive and disciplined manner in 2017. Competition from not only traditional names, but newer entrance as well continues to intensify versus a year ago. Our core priorities remain unchanged, profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our distributors and outstanding value to our customers. In summary, 2016 was a very strong year in so many respects yet very challenging in others. As always there is work in front of us for 2017 and we're fully committed to the journey ahead. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the other segments our investment performance and update you on our capital management plans. Mutual Funds core earnings totaled $17 million this year down from $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, principally due to transaction expenses for the acquisition of Lattice and the adoption of Schroders U.S. mutual funds. Asset management fees rose about 3% from the prior year due to higher average daily AUM. Although the growth in fees continues to be impacted in part by the shift to lower fee mutual funds. Total AUM increased 6% including the impact of both market appreciation and almost $3 billion from the Schroders funds. Talcott continues to perform well, core earnings were $111 million, up strongly from $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to higher returns on limited partnerships and a $14 million tax benefit from a prior year federal tax audit. Aside from these items Talcott\u2019s core earnings declined due to lower variable annuity fee income driven by the run-off of the book. During 2016 VA contract count decreased by 10%, which we expect will drive a similar rate of increase in Talcott\u2019s 2017 core earnings excluding the favorable items in 2016. In the slides posted to our website last night we also provided our annual update of Talcott statutory capital allocation by product. The capital allocation has not changed materially since last year, consistent with prior year's significant portion of Talcott capital supports our institutional and individual fixed annuity blocks. At year-end statutory surplus totaled $4.4 billion and the capital allocation shows expected 2017 dividends of $600 million, $300 million of which we received in January. We also provided an update on capital margins in base stress and favorable scenarios. Our analysis of Talcott\u2019s capital adequacy remains focused on the stress scenario not based on current capital or market conditions. Our goal is to maintain at least 200% company action level risk based capital in the stress scenario and also considers liquidity, intangible assets and other factors. The assumptions used for these scenarios, which we also provided are generally consisted with prior years. The stress scenario has a 40% drop in equity markets from current levels are roughly 1350 on the S&P 500, lower interest rates and significant credit losses. As summarized in the slide, in the stress scenario we estimate the capital margin to be about $1.4 billion at year-end 2018, compared with $2.9 billion in the base case. Both scenarios include $600 million of dividends in 2017. Consistent with prior year, the primary impacts in the stress scenario come from interest rates and credit losses, primarily in the individual fixed and institutional annuity blocks and decreased fee income on the VA block. This amount of capital margin demonstrates that Talcott is adequately capitalized for adverse capital market environments. Turning to investments, all-in results were strong this quarter and included high returns on real-estate and private equity LPs. Total LP investment income was $73 million before tax compare to $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 for an annualized return of 12% this quarter and 8.5% for full year 2016. Excluding LPs the total before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4.2% this quarter, slightly better than 4.1% last year largely due to non-routine investment income such as prepayment penalties on mortgage loans and make whole payments on fixed maturities. These items are episodic and were especially high this quarter totaling $32 million before tax, about 2.5 times higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding LPs and non-routines the annualized portfolio yield was essentially flat. For the P&C portfolio the annualized yield excluding LPs was 3.9% up from 3.7% in fourth quarter of 2015, but relatively flat adjusted for the non-routine items. Full year P&C net investment income was about $1.2 billion including $101 million for LPs. Looking at 2017, based on current interest rates we expect the P&C net investment income excluding limited partnership to decline about 7% to $1 billion before tax for two principle reasons. The first driver of lower P&C investment income is that we expect a slightly lower P&C portfolio yield excluding LPs. The full year portfolio yield was 3.8%, the 2016 reinvestment yield were about 60 basis points lower than sales and maturities, resulting in a sequential decline in the portfolio yield during 2016. Although higher reinvestment rates could offset some of this pressure credit spreads have also tightened and we would expect a lower level of non-routine items in a higher rate environment. To give you an idea of sensitivity to higher interest rate, we estimate that if 2017 reinvestment rates were 50 basis points higher across the curve, 2017 full year P&C net investment income would increase by about $20 million before tax. The second factor driving P&C net investment income lower in 2017 is that P&C investment portfolio will decreased by about $1 billion or 3% early in the year due to the net impact of the $650 million we paid in January for the National Indemnity Cover and the pending sale of the UK P&C runoff subsidiaries. Turning to credit performance, our experience remains very good with total impairments in mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of $12 million before tax down from $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, which included losses on some energy, mineral and mining related exposures. To conclude on earnings, fourth quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.08 essentially flat with $1.07 in fourth quarter 2015 as the impact of our share repurchase program offset the 7% decrease in core earnings. For the full year core earnings ROE was down due to Personal Lines results and the second quarter charge for adverse development for A&E. 2016 core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 8.9% and the P&C core earnings ROE was 9.9%. Excluding the A&E charge the 12 month core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 10.3% and P&C was 12%. Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share excluding AOCI at December 31, 2016 was up 3% compared to a year ago. Before turning to your questions, I wanted to provide an update on our capital management plans. During the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased $280 million of stock, which completed the $4.375 billion equity repurchase plan that expired on December 31st. In January of this year, we repurchased about 2.3 million of shares for $110 million, which leaves approximately $1.2 billion available under the 2017 equity repurchase authorization. With respect to debt management plans, in October we repaid $275 million of maturing debt. As we previously announced, we will repay $416 million of senior notes at maturity in March, which is our only debt maturity in 2017. In addition to these two actions, we also intend to call our 8.125, 500 million of junior subordinated bond, when it becomes redeemable at par in June of 2018. To fund this call this month we will exercise our put option on the Glen Meadow contingent capital facility, which will result in the issuance of $500 million of junior subordinated debt. This debt will have a floating rate coupon of three months LIBOR, plus 212.5 basis points or about 3 and 1.8% at current rates. The impact of these actions are debt-to-total capital ratios will be modest as the Glen Meadow issuance will be largely offset by the senior note maturity in the first quarter and our 2018 ratio will decrease from the repayment of the junior subordinated bonds. In addition the coverage ratios will improve in \u201817 and \u201818 due to lower interest expense resulting from debt repayment. To conclude, fourth quarter results were very strong for Commercial Lines and group benefits and the performance of our investment portfolio and other businesses was very good. In 2017 we are focused on achieving core earnings per share growth, driven by better Personal Lines results, continued strong margins and investment performance in our other businesses and the impact of our capital management plans. In addition, the new reinsurance agreement covering U.S. A&E exposures should eliminate the economic impact of any adverse development. I will now turn the call to Sabra, so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Elisa, I\u2019ll ask you to give the instructions for Q&A in just a second, but for in the meantime I just wanted to note that for those of you who are interested in catching up with us in person, Beth will be attending the Credit Suisse Conference in Miami on Tuesday next week and Chris will be in Boston at a lunch hosted by Deutsche Bank on Wednesday February 8th. In addition Chris, Doug and Beth will be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference in New York on February 15th, holding a fireside chat as well as some small group meetings. And then finally, I would note that Doug will be on the Commercial Lines panel at [indiscernible] in early March this year. We hope to see all of you, at one or more of those events. Elisa, could you give the directions again. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey thanks, good morning. I had one question and then John Nadel had a follow-up. But I guess just looking at the guidance in P&C commercial, I guess this year on an underlying basis, combined ratio is 89 for -- and the midpoint of the guide you are giving implies a decent amount of deterioration after that and I realize that this year you had some favorable items with property, workers comp, but it also seems like rate worked against you, you\u2019ve also talked about commercial auto. So it seems like there is some headwinds as well. So just trying to square, the type of scenarios that will potentially get you up towards that midpoint or above that, because I guess that just seems like a decent amount of volatility off of this year\u2019s results? Thanks. Chris Swift : Ryan it\u2019s Chris. Thanks. I\u2019ll ask Doug to add his color too, but I would just ask you to consider just macro trends in general. The pricing environment has been soft and our views are its going to continue to soften into \u201817. So rates are coming down, pricing is not you know keeping up in aggregate what we believe are long-term loss cost trends. Capital is abundant in the industry and there is many competitors both in the traditional markets and those that are coming from offshore to compete in our market. So you put it all together and that\u2019s our view of the environment. We\u2019re going to work our tail off to maintain those margins, but at this point and knowing our customer embrace so well we want to retain as much as our business as we can and if there is some give that we need to give on price to retain that we\u2019ll consider that. So we want to retain our best customers and we know that the price environment is very dynamic. So Doug what would you add from a color perspective? Doug Elliot : Sure, Ryan the first thing I would say is that very pleased about 2016, pleased about the trends that we\u2019ve been to work on with our claim department and our pricing actions, very pleased about middle market as I lean into 2017 don\u2019t expect all those trends to continue. So as I think about what\u2019s in front of us with workers compensation we\u2019re still thinking that our medical trends long-term are in the 6% range and indemnity 3% to 4%. As I look at that line which matters a great deal for our company because we\u2019re slightly overweight in comp with our expertise, it\u2019s a line right now that is feeling some degree of pressure on the pricing side in the marketplace. So that is one of the things I think about, clearly we\u2019re at work on commercial auto and expect progress there and expect to improve results, but we\u2019re feeling a little bit of pressure on the general liability area across the book. And so as we planned into 2017 we try to be prudent with our loss assumptions, fair and thoughtful about what we\u2019re doing with the pricing. I just feel a bit of pressure that yes we were able to withstand in 2016 and hope to do that again. We\u2019d love to repeat that performance in \u201817 I know that\u2019s our goal, but also want to be reasonable in our expectation. John Nadel : So this is John, Chris there is increasing chatter about a potential sale of Talcott over the -- that chatter has been increasing over the past several months. I wouldn\u2019t ask you to comment on that, but I am interested in what your preference is for use of proceeds if you assume the transaction were to occur, should we expect you to focus on trying to replace those lost earnings contribution via acquisitions or should we expect that you\u2019ll continue to focus more on returning freed up capital to shareholders via incremental buybacks and debt management? Chris Swift : Thanks for not asking about Talcott directly. I think the point in time where we\u2019re at right now John is we\u2019ve done a lot particularly you saw with the legacy P&C liabilities this year, so Talcott contributes as it does today. We talk about managing the risk effectively and returning capital and we\u2019re personally comfortable doing that, but hypothetically how we think about any capital that would be freed up. First we would focus on right sizing debt-to-equity ratios. And then we would think in terms of how do we replace those earnings via growth strategies both those that we can control from an organic side and then acquisition side, so that would be a high priority. I think we\u2019ve been talking about that for at least the last 9 to 12 months as far as the priority of our capital. So yes I would prioritize growth in earnings over just share buybacks at that point. John Nadel : Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to level set for Talcott, I believe you said earnings will be down for Talcott 10% in 2017 adjusting for unusual items in 2016. So what\u2019s the baseline you\u2019re using for 2016? Beth Bombara : Yes so if you look at our results over the last 12 months we have benefited from partnership return sort of an access of our plan and some of these one-time items. So if you adjust for that and take -- think about a 10% reduction in sort of run rate of Talcott. I think you\u2019ll see that you\u2019ll kind of get in that $300 million range for 2017. Jay Gelb : That\u2019s helpful, thanks Beth. And basically in line with what we were expecting. The other question I had a little more broadly on the return on equity profile. Based on all the puts and takes you're expecting for 2017 and you've already known about the pace of share buybacks $1.3 billion. Where do you think that roughly puts you for return on equity in 2017? Chris Swift : Jay it's Chris well I appreciate the call or the question on the call here. So if I look at and we've trying to talk to our key ROE metric is ex- Talcott, I think everyone knows there is a number of trap capital in Talcott. So if I look at where we ended \u201816 at 8.9 on a trailing 12 month basis. I think if we perform to the plan that we outlined and the metrics that we gave you that could be up 200 basis points especially without A&E charge in '17. Jay Gelb : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher for Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Thomas Gallagher : Good morning. Chris I will ask a direct question on Talcott, just from an M&A standpoint, can you comment on where you would see kind of bid-ask spreads right now. I think from I've heard from you guys before there were some challenges related to the VA part considering regulatory developments and some tax questions. But as you guys show majority of capital is not back into VA part it's backing to general account part. So I assume the environment has gotten a lot better from an M&A standpoint, but just curious what you\u2019re thinking there? Chris Swift : Appreciate the direct question. And look we're not going to speculate on what we may or may not do. I think Beth and I've been consistent in talking in terms of risk is managed well. We have been taking excess capital out and plan to as you saw in '17. And if there are counter parties out there we'll continue to work hard to find parties that are interested in buying two legal entities that have both variable and fixed annuities both deferred and payout in them. And you can't just point to one block of business and exclude the other because just give the legal entity nature. And we're at the point in our cycle right now where simple reinsurance transactions really don't accomplish our mission Tom. So you put all that together and I\u2019ll let you conclude. Rising rates help, robust equity markets growth prospects for the future. So I'm actually bullish on our economic outlook in general which I think bodes well for these types of liability structures going forward. Thomas Gallagher : Okay, appreciate that. And then just a question on the NICO deal, the $650 million of premium. I just want to understand would that -- did you transfer long-term bonds or was that cash. And can you comment roughly what the lost yield would have been for you on that transaction? Beth Bombara : Yes so currently we transferred cash, but obviously when you think about taking $650 million of cash out of the system that comes with thinking about liquidating other assets. So we provided I believe in our press release when we announced the transaction that we'd expect some decrease in that investment income coming from there to be modest. And that's all contemplated in the guidance that we've given relative to P&C net investment income for next year. Thomas Gallagher : But Beth I guess my question was, I assume there was a long duration portfolio backing that line. And would those associated bonds the ones that were sold. So was there a disproportionate loss of yield or was it not that big of a yield? Beth Bombara : Yes I wouldn't think about it at that way. Again to some extent yes there was -- there is assets backing that portfolio. But when we look to manage the portfolio on a P&C side it's a little bit probably more fungible than you probably think of on a life side. And so net-net we took all that into consideration and looking at what we're anticipating for the net investment income for P&C next year including some of the modest declines that we see in overall yield, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that as a significant driver of a decrease in P&C yield. Thomas Gallagher : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes thanks a couple of questions here. First, Dough I just wanted to dive back into the Commercial Lines guidance a little bit here and the question I guess I have is how different is your kind of trend assumption that you\u2019re thinking about for \u201817 today versus when you were going into \u201816 and providing guidance. So are you still kind of thinking long-term trend or if things kind of deteriorated are you seeing that deterioration happening, which makes you more concerned about what\u2019s happening in \u201817 from a trend perspective? Chris Swift : Fair question Brian, I would say in the comp area pretty consistent. Our view of go forward versus what we\u2019re experiencing very consistent. Auto, the severity in our commercial auto book we\u2019ve got higher expectations of lost trend in \u201817 than we did in \u201816, absolutely. And in GL, slightly higher as well. So nothing radically different, but we\u2019re feeling a little bit pressure across the liability book. We\u2019re on it, we\u2019re pricing for it, but we also see the market and the competitive dynamics around us. I think we just wanted to pick a prudent path. Brian Meredith : Got you appreciate that. And then my second question is looking at the benefits business I know that you all had some initiatives to develop products and stuff basically to kind of cater to the ACA believe it was supplemental products. Has your thoughts on that changed now that there could potentially be repealed that or changes to that and kind of where you\u2019re thinking on that? Chris Swift : Brian it\u2019s Chris. Generally no, I mean those supplemental products as you said had some strict definitions around of it given ACA. So if ACA gets repealed a little bit you have to watch to see the impact on the supplementary market, but we would not be interested in getting into any I\u2019ll call it mini medical plans or things along those lines. We think the nature of these products the more we market them, more we educate our customer base on them. We\u2019ll fit the needs with or without major ACA refinement. Brian Meredith : Great. Doug Elliot : Brian the only thing I would add is that clearly last three years major focus on getting our voluntary suite up to par and where it needs to be. Secondly, and Chris I think has talked about this in the past we are leaning into A&H [ph] over the next year or so. We\u2019ve had an A&H product out there, we looked at it. We think it needs some retooling we\u2019re working on that now, and I think more to talk about as we move through 2017. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great thanks. If I can just jump up on Brian\u2019s question, do your 2017 auto spend expectations are those in line with what you saw in the fourth quarter of 2016? Chris Swift : They are Meyer. Meyer Shields : Okay. So that means you\u2019re not expecting further acceleration going forward? Chris Swift : No but we are, similarly to first lines we do see this world in terms of the new norm. So we\u2019re expecting some of the pressure that we\u2019re feeling and have felt in 2016 to continue into \u201817 and we\u2019re making those types of choice in our trend assumptions both on personal lines and also on commercial. The difference in personal lines is that as you know we\u2019ve talked about a number of initiatives, we think we can bend the loss trend curve, based on the initiatives that we\u2019ve enumerated and we\u2019re working hard to do that, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make progress against that stated goal because we\u2019ve got some work to do to get our auto loss ratio, auto combined ratios into those 96, 96.5 category. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Two quick questions on the commercial side, one it looks like mall commercial pricing improved a little bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, I was hoping you could talk about that? And also maybe some more detail on the new entrance, I guess I'm a little more surprised that there are new entrance into the standard commercial lines rather than specialty. Chris Swift : Yes we take them one-by-one. We\u2019re clearly leaning into auto and our package liability business and you\u2019re seeing that in the marketplace. So we are looking for more rate in Q4 and we\u2019re looking for little bit more rate in Q1 of 2017. So there\u2019s an escalation based on the pressures we\u2019re feeling with loss trend. That\u2019s driving what\u2019s happening in small commercial. And relative to new entrance, fourth quarter was pretty much a normal quarter for us. So, yes there are new names they are coming at small from different directions. I don\u2019t think there is anything different in our results that was impacted by any of those names and we\u2019ll continue to respect and watch and think about our strategy going forward. But I feel very good about where our small commercial business is operating and pleased that we are leaning in relative to building new product and some of tools that we\u2019re rolling out for customers in the coming quarters. Meyer Shields : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jay Cohen : Thanks. Just have couple of questions for Doug. First on the commercial side specifically in the small and mid-fourth quarter accident year loss ratio is going to the best you saw all year that was a very good trend as the year progressed, the fourth quarter being very good. Was there anything helping for that low level of non-cat whether or were you adjusting kind of the full year loss ratios in the fourth quarter? Doug Elliot : There isn\u2019t anything that sticks out in my mind Jay, obviously when we get to year-end we want to make sure and do our best job in making sure the accident year full year is where it needs to be. In general fourth quarter weather is slightly better non-cat so there is a little bit of a positive bias on our property side both small and middle. And we experienced some of that in the fourth quarter, obviously December is the month that triggers where we have a good property quarter or not in fourth quarter. But there isn\u2019t anything to speak about that I think I would raise that level. Jay Cohen : Okay, great. Second question, on the auto side, I guess it could be argue that size and scale are increasingly important in auto insurance and likely will be going forward you\u2019re shrinking this business obviously due to profitability issues, do you get concerned that by shrinking the business you\u2019re losing out on the scale that you might need in the future to keep very effectively? Chris Swift : Jay, it\u2019s Chris, I would say we are taking the corrective actions necessary to improve our profitability and that will obviously require some top-line shrinkage. I think we focus primarily on the older age market, we think we have a niche that we\u2019ve understood for a number of years, our relationship with ARP is deep and very strategic for us and trusted. So, I don\u2019t think scale in it by itself in that market is required if we were ever to think in terms of more of a mass market strategy then I would say scale and how we would think about it differently but we are not thinking about that. So, I think we have the appropriate underwriting skills the appropriate insights into that call a customer segment and I think we have the appropriate claim skills embedded in the organization across the country to effectively manage it. We\u2019re in a rough spot now no doubt, but we are not giving up and it continues to be a strategic niche for us going forward. Jay Cohen : Great, that actually makes sense. Thanks Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions on the personal auto side, we were putting together some of your comments it seems like when you came to your outlook you are assuming we are going to maintain the high BI [ph] severity trends so I\u2019m assuming kind of to start \u201817 is basically the trends that you ended \u201816 with. Just kind of confirming that. And then as you think about the components to get to your margin goal are you assuming that there is some improvements both from the loss as well as earnings through some of the expense initiatives, additional expense initiatives next year? And then as we think a little bit further out you think is 2018 when you see obviously you pointed taking more rates that will return to profitably in the auto book as you think about going out a little bit further than \u201817? Doug Elliot : Please let me try to tackle the pieces that all add up to obviously our overall performance. So on the pricing side we\u2019ve given you pretty clear inside into the progress we are making and just a few moments ago I also gave you a little bit lens into 2017 and the fact that our written pricing will go up over the next couple of quarter. So as that earns its way into the book we are getting a positive contributor to our progress against targets. At the core of your question relative to loss trends we are expecting from a gross perspective our loss trends in \u201817 to be about where they are in \u201816. So as we think about our data our expectation for the accident year \u201816 is that our loss trend total frequency and severity put together is in that fixed range 5.5 to 6 and that's essentially where we are planning for our gross trend in \u201817. What\u2019s different about \u201817 is now the number of initiatives that we\u2019ve been working and putting into market over the past four to five quarters, we expect some traction and we\u2019re beginning to see that traction. So, we\u2019re expecting several points of improvement against that loss trend and the combination of earned rate working through and a bending of the loss trend curve drives our expectation of improvement in performance both in \u201817 and candidly accelerating into \u201818 as well. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then there is -- when you think about that so do you think you also get some level of expense improvement in \u201817 when you come to your guidance or it\u2019s more driven off of improvement on the loss ratio side of the auto book? Doug Elliot : The core of our changes in the loss arena, I think our expenses we\u2019ve manage our expenses according I don\u2019t see a lot there in fact two and three and four quarters and I expect to be in a very different rate adequacy spot and we\u2019ve got places around the country where we\u2019re feeling much better today that we are pricing for the norms of the exposures in loss trend and I think you\u2019ll see us begin to be more aggressive and thoughtful in our growth aspect. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Dwelle : Good morning. I wanted to ask a question related to the asbestos [ph] transaction. I mean is there anything left there at all or maybe sit differently when you do your A&E study next summer, is there anything that can produce the change to reserves that will impact result either positively or negatively? Beth Bombara : So I\u2019ll take it, it\u2019s Beth. So couple of things one, just to be clear and this will be in our 10-K we intend to do our A&E studies in the fourth quarter going forward just given the transaction that we did. If we don\u2019t anticipate it to be on a significant obviously. As it relates to our exposure that's left as it relates to A&E again this Treaty covers substantially all of the A&E exposure that we have remained once we complete the sale of our UK subsidiary. The one thing though that we did retain as part of the transaction is to the extent that there is any uncollectable reinsurance that comes from our A&E exposures we would still bear that risk. So, that has not been a significant driver of our A&E reserve increases over the last couple of years, but that is one aspect of it that we did retain. Chris Swift : Mark, it\u2019s Chris, the only thing I would add is as you know asbestos language and policy forms changed in 85 for an absolute exclusion. There is some post 85 reserves that we had that we also seeded. So I think in terms of pre and post 85 A&E reserves are part of this cover. Mark Dwelle : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then in your comments remain related to the group benefits you mentioned the $30 million charge related to Pen Treaty maybe I missed it in the early remarks did you specify when that would be taken or any timing on that? Beth Bombara : So again that's going to be based on facts and circumstances, the charge we will incur once the assessment is made and liquidation again. We think that could be first quarter, but it\u2019s really outside of our control and we can\u2019t -- we won\u2019t book the amount until there has been a declaration. Mark Dwelle : Got it, thank you. That's all my questions. Operator : We have no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Lisa, and thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in the Hartford. If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to follow-up with Investor Relations by email or phone and we\u2019ll get back to as quickly as possible. And as I mentioned we hope to see you all soon at one of the event we\u2019ll be attending. Thank you and we wish you good weekend. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford is off to a very good start in 2017. Core earnings per diluted share increased 5% in the first quarter, and we returned over $400 million to shareholders through repurchases and common dividends. Underlying P&C results were strong. However, catastrophe losses were exceptionally high due to elevated seasonal wind and hail activity in the central U.S. Starting with personal auto. The pricing, underwriting and distribution actions we have implemented over the past 18 months, are gaining traction. The underlying combined ratio improved over 5 points when adjusting first quarter 2016 loss ratios for the average development we recognized during calendar year 2016. Renewal written price increases have been in the high single digit rates over the past several quarters and exceeded 10% this quarter, while our accident year loss ratio picks for 2015 and 2016 are holding. While the top-line is down, our AARP relationship is a competitive advantage for The Hartford, and our deep knowledge of this customer segment positions us well for growth in personal auto as margins continue to improve. All-in, I am pleased with the progress and remain confident that we will achieve improved results in 2017 and continuing into 2018. Commercial Lines achieved the 90.9 underlying combined ratio, reflecting disciplined underwriting in a competitive market. Small commercial posted outstanding performance with 6% written premium growth and excellent margins but competition remains robust. We\u2019re intently focused on advancing our leadership in this market by innovating and enhancing our best-in-class capabilities. We\u2019re doing this by leveraging our technology, data and underwriting expertise, deep agency relationships and leading customer service centers. Middle Market delivered good performance with 4% growth in written premiums and a 93.8 underlying combined ratio. In this challenging middle market environment, we remain committed to disciplined risk selection. The overall Commercial Lines results reflect the investments we\u2019ve made over the past several years, which have enabled us to become a substantially broader and deeper risk player with expanded product capabilities and new industry verticals. In addition, our acquisition of Maxum is already contributing as our new E&S capabilities have given us the opportunity to participate in the wholesale marketplace. Group Benefits delivered excellent core earnings this year, excluding a charge for the previously disclosed Penn Treaty liquidation. Top-line growth picked up to 4% and loss experience continues to be excellent, reflecting our claims expertise and the improvements we\u2019ve made in our book of business over the years. Group Benefits is a core strategic business for The Hartford with a well established brand and a top five market position. The business has momentum with good traction in voluntary sales activities with our enhanced product suite and a total sales pipeline that\u2019s up significantly over the prior year. Mutual Funds had a great quarter with total assets under management now exceeding $100 billion. Strong market conditions and investment performance led to sales of over $7 billion and net positive flows of $1.3 billion including significant sales and flows from the Schroders [ph] sub-advised funds. As we look forward in 2017, our strategic priorities remain consistent : Organic growth; improved customer experience; and developing new operating capabilities. The priority for our excess capital is to support these strategic objectives, particularly in areas such as small commercial, specialty risk products, A&H, benefits in industry verticals that expand our underwriting appetite. We want to provide agents and policyholders with insurance solutions for more of their risk needs and being easier company for them to do business with. As I\u2019ve said before, we have an organic growth orientation but we will consider acquisitions that make financial sense and accelerate the achievement of our strategic objectives. In closing, I am pleased with our execution in navigating very competitive market conditions in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and with the progress we\u2019ve made in personal auto. I\u2019m optimistic about the initiatives we have underway to continue to profitably grow our businesses and to create long-term shareholder value. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results for property and casualty and Group Benefits excluding catastrophes were very good and consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial Line businesses posted strong underlying performance in a competitive market. Personal Lines auto loss cost trends were in line with the full year outlook we shared in February. And after a very challenging 2016, we\u2019re pleased with our progress. And Group Benefits posted another quarter of strong earnings, excluding the Penn Treaty guaranteed fund assessment. Before I get into the details of our performance, let me touch on catastrophe losses, which were $150 million pretax for the quarter. Wind, hail and tornado activity across the South, Southeast and Midwest was higher than normal. First quarter catastrophes typically involve winter storm events, which were not as significant this year. Compared to first quarter of 2016, our catastrophe losses were up $59 million pretax. However, last year, several catastrophes hit near the close of the quarter. We subsequently received a number of late-reported commercial losses that drove our estimate for the quarter up to $131 million by year-end. On this basis, catastrophe losses for first quarter 2017 increased by $19 million. Let me now share some additional details on the performance of our business units. The first quarter 2017 combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 96, up 4.9 points from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher catastrophe losses, as I just mentioned, and a change to slightly adverse prior year development versus favorable development last year. Prior year development for the quarter includes favorable development in workers\u2019 compensation where our loss trends remain excellent. Frequency trends continue to run better than expectations, particularly in the more recent accident years. Bond was also favorable as trends in both contract and commercial surety continued to emerge better than expected. On the other hand, commercial auto remains a hotspot for us as well as the industry, and we increased prior year reserves in Small Commercial and National Accounts to ensure that we\u2019re proactively responding to the latest signals of higher bodily injury severity and increased litigation. Although the prior year development is disappointing, we continue to achieve high single digit written price increases and execute on our underwriting actions. Our new business and retentions across Commercial is down, which we expect to continue into 2017. The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was very good at 90.9 for the first quarter, up 1.3 points from 2016, in line with our expectations. Given competitive market conditions, I\u2019m very pleased with our execution across all our commercial businesses, recognizing that we have more work to do in commercial auto. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.3% for the first quarter, up 90 basis points from fourth quarter 2016. Small Commercial was up in all lines versus prior year and sequentially. This speaks to the strength of our value proposition in the marketplace and the ability of our team to execute in product, sales and underwriting. In Middle Market, renewal written pricing turned positive from flat in fourth quarter 2016. This is a market segment where price competition has been notable. I\u2019m encouraged by our disciplined pricing actions, particularly in workers\u2019 compensation. Our underwriting teams continue to hold the line, exercising sound judgment on a case-by-case basis. Small Commercial had an excellent first quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.3. Written premium grew 6%, driven by strong retentions and $154 million of new business, including $15 million from Maxum. Middle Market delivered a solid underlying combined ratio of 93.8 for the first quarter, deteriorating 1.8 points from 2016. Slight margin compression in several lines, including general liability and auto was partially offset by favorable non-catastrophe property losses. Expenses were higher due to increased technology and other operating costs. Written premium increased 4% based on solid retentions and strong new business production of $128 million, up 24% versus last year. Our new business growth was driven primarily from our industry verticals and specialized practice teams, which we\u2019ve been steadily gaining traction over the last three to four years. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 97.5 for the first quarter deteriorated 3.2 points from 2016. This was driven by higher operating costs and margin compression in excess auto liability. Written premium in Specialty Commercial was up 5% for the quarter, largely the result of strong new and renewal premium and bond. Shifting over to Personal Lines. We posted a combined ratio of 99.3 for the first quarter of 2017, improving six tenths of a point from a year ago. Higher catastrophe losses in 2017 were more than offset by a change from unfavorable prior year development in 2016 to slightly favorable development this year. The underlying combined ratio of 91.2 deteriorated 1.5 points from last year. This was heavily driven by homeowners, where the underlying combined ratio for the first quarter was 78.9, deteriorating 3.8 points versus last year due to higher non-catastrophe weather and fire losses. In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio for first quarter 2017 was 96.6 with a loss ratio of 75.6 versus a 2016 reported loss ratio of 72.1. However, by year-end 2016, we had increased the accident year auto loss ratio for first quarter 2016 by approximately 6 points. Compared to this adjusted loss ratio, first quarter 2017 has improved 2.6 points, as noted in the slide presentation. We\u2019re closely monitoring the effects of our pricing, underwriting and agency management actions on our overall loss costs and are very pleased with the improving trends we see. Auto frequency moderated considerably in the first quarter and severity returned to more historical levels. The Personal Lines auto expense ratio for the first quarter was lower this year by approximately 3 points, due primarily to reduced new business acquisition expenses. The first quarter auto loss ratio improvement is consistent with our expectations and in line with the full year 2017 auto combined ratio outlook of 101 to 103 that we shared with you back in February. That outlook includes approximately 1 point for catastrophes. Written premium for Personal Lines was down 7% versus first quarter of last year. New business has decreased as we have continued to address our rate needs with added filings and improved underwriting segmentation. We\u2019re pleased with our progress to-date as our actions and results continue to track closely with our expectations. Given our improving trends and higher rate levels, we expect to increase our AARP new business marketing efforts during the second half of the year. Now, let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for the first quarter was $40 million with a margin of 4.3%. This includes a guaranteed fund assessment of $13 million after tax for Penn Treaty, which we noted last quarter. Excluding this assessment, core earnings was up $5 million, primarily due to favorable net investment income with an adjusted margin of 5.8%, reflecting very strong underlying performance in this business. The group life and disability loss ratios this quarter were largely consistent with prior year. Group life trends have been slightly favorable and very stable relative to the volatility we experienced in 2016. Group disability, although slightly elevated this quarter, continues to perform within our expected range and we feel very positive about our trends. Looking at the top line. First quarter fully insured ongoing premium increased 4%. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business was approximately 90%, and fully insured ongoing sales were $211 million. Overall, it was a healthy sales quarter and we\u2019re pleased with our competitive positioning in the market. In summary, first quarter 2017 represents a solid start to the year for all our Property, Casualty and Group Benefit businesses. Overall, we remain disciplined and balanced in our execution to deliver profitable growth. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to cover the other segments, our investment performance and provide an update on the execution of our capital management plans. Strong investment performance, net flows and rising equity markets led to Mutual Funds\u2019 core earnings increasing to $23 million this quarter compared with $20 million in the first quarter of 2016. At least 70% of our funds are beating their peers over the one-year, three-year and five-year period. Sales of $7.2 billion generated positive net flows of $1.3 billion in the quarter compared to $4.7 billion of sales and approximately $200 million of net outflows during first quarter of 2016. Strong equity markets and the adoption of the Schroders funds in October 2016 drove total segment AUM to $103.2 billion, a 14% increase from the same period in 2016. Talcott continues to perform well. Core earnings were $83 million, up from $77 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to higher returns on limited partnerships. Over the past four quarters, VA contracts count decreased 10% and fixed annuity contracts decreased 6%. As a reminder, Talcott paid a dividend of $300 million to the holding company in January and we expect another $300 million in the second half of the year. Talcott ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in statutory surplus. The investment portfolio also continues to perform well. Total LP investment income was $17 million, before tax, compared to $8 million in the first quarter 2016, which included losses on hedge funds. Excluding LPs, the total before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4% this quarter, slightly lower than the 4.1% last year, largely due to the impact of lower reinvestment rates versus the yield on sales and maturities over the past year. For the P&C portfolio, the annualized yield excluding LPs was 3.7%, down from 3.8% in first quarter 2016. Credit experience remains very good with total impairment and mortgage loan valuation reserve charges of only $1 million before tax, down from $23 million in the first quarter of 2016, which included energy impairments of $16 million. To conclude on earnings, first quarter core earnings per diluted share was $1, up 5% from $0.95 in first quarter 2016 as the impact of our share repurchase program more than offset the 2% decrease in core earnings. The 12-month core earnings ROE was 7.6% and the core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott was 8.6%, both of which include the impact of prior development on our A&E exposures prior to the purchase of the loss development cover. Excluding the A&E charge, 12-month core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 10%. Turning to shareholders\u2019 equity. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI at March 31, 2017, was up 3% compared to a year ago. Before taking questions, I want to provide an update on the execution of our capital management plan. During the quarter, we repurchased $325 million of stock. During the month of April through the 25th, we repurchased about 1.9 million shares for $92 million. This leaves approximately $883 million available under the $1.3 billion equity repurchase authorization for 2017. With respect to debt management, in March, we repaid $416 million of senior notes, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. We also exercised the option on the Glen Meadow contingent capital facility, which resulted in the issuance of $500 million of junior subordinated debt. As a reminder, we intend to use the proceeds to call our 8.125% $500 million Junior subordinated debentures when they become redeemable at par in June 2018. To conclude, we are off to a good start in 2017. The actions that we have taken in Personal Lines are taking hold and we expect further improvement in 2017 and 2018. Underlying results remain strong for Commercial Lines, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, and we are very pleased with our investment performance.  I will now turn the call over to Sabra, so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Just a reminder that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A. If you have to drop off or if we run out of time before we get to your question, please email or call the Investor Relations team and we\u2019ll follow up with you as soon as possible today. Sarah, could you please repeat the instructions for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thank you. A couple of quick ones here. First, Chris and Doug, I\u2019m just curious, the underlying combined ratio development that we saw in the Commercial Lines area, I think, related to GL commercial auto, is that something that you guys are anticipating as you laid out guidance for the year kind of within kind of where your expectations are? Chris Swift : Brian, from a guidance side, Doug could give you a little more color on what we\u2019re really seeing and feeling but we don\u2019t guide for prior year adverse or positive development. So, Doug, I know we\u2019ve been watching commercial auto trends specifically. Do you mind giving Brian a little more color? Doug Elliot : So, I guess, a couple of points. One is relative to general liability, little bit of pressure from a prior program but we are watching the GL line overall. First quarter is essentially in line with a little pressure from program that we had several years ago. On the auto side, we\u2019ve been underwriting, re-underwriting and working pricing last couple of years, a little bit of pressure in our excess National Account book and also in Small Commercial. So, feel good about the work we\u2019ve done in Middle but we did feel a little bit of prior year pressure in Small and we felt like we needed to address both that in our National Account book. Brian Meredith : And then, second question is, Chris, there\u2019s a bill, I believe it\u2019s in the Senate right now, Connecticut Senate, that would enable, I guess, you guys could break up Talcott to separate pieces. Could you give us a status on kind of where you know that bill is right now, sort of time line? And what would it mean for your kind of desires to get rid of Talcott? Chris Swift : Yes. I think the bill you\u2019re referring to is we call it the division\u2019s bill. I would share with you -- it\u2019s something that we have sponsored, really from all our restructuring activities over the last couple of years, Brian. We observed some better practices in the different parts of the country or the world, in fact. And we have worked with the Connecticut Department to sponsor it. I would say sponsoring it and reading anything into what it means from a possible transaction, I would not do that. I think what we viewed it as a piece of legislation and rules and regulations that we thought our leading regulator, in the Connecticut Department of Insurance, should avail itself and avail all Connecticut companies with the opportunity to separate new businesses and legal entities and transact those types of activities that are aligned to their go-forward transactions. So the bill is in Congress right now. It\u2019s come out of Congress. The legislature side of Connecticut, it needs to go to the Senate side, it then needs to be signed by the Governor. The legislature is in session, I think, through late June, and we\u2019re optimistic that it will get passed and signed by the Governor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb for Barclays. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : Thank you. I have a couple of questions, first on personal auto. The magnitude of rate increase, 10.5% in the current quarter is probably among the highest of any of the companies I track. I just wanted to get your perspective on what kind of impact that\u2019s having on Hartford within the market. Doug Elliot : Jay, thanks. This is Doug. Last quarter, I believe on the call, I did give you a little bit of forward lean into what we expected to see over the first three to four quarters of 2017. And this 10.5 is largely in line with that commentary. So, yes, we\u2019re pleased. Obviously, this is the written element, so it\u2019s got to earn its way in but we feel like there\u2019s forward traction on our actions, including pricing in our first line\u2019s book and encouraged by the start to 2017. Jay Gelb : Okay. And then, on claims inflation personal auto, in the deck, it was mentioned that there\u2019s less impact from personal auto frequency and severity. Can you provide us some more insight in terms of what you\u2019re seeing on the trends there? Doug Elliot : Sure. On the frequency side, Jay, our numbers have essentially flattened out. So, as we go back over the prior couple of years, we had some small single-digit moving to mid-single digit pressure on frequency. And as we look back over this quarter and the last several quarters, we feel very good, and it\u2019s essentially flat. On the severity side, as we\u2019ve talked on prior calls, in our plans, we\u2019re in the mid-single digits, maybe on the four to five range on severity, and the first quarter essentially came in as expected. So, pleased that our view of the year is playing out as we had hoped. Very watchful, 90 days does not make a final outcome. But relative to the path we have carved and our goal of over these two years to make improvements financially that are required, very good start to 2017. Jay Gelb : Good to hear. And then, separately, there has been some persistent press reports about potential Talcott transaction. And I\u2019m just looking at the difference between statutory capital of $4 billion and GAAP equity of -- ex AOCI of $7.3 billion. If a transaction were to come in below stacked capital, how should we think about the financial implication to that? Chris Swift : Jay, it\u2019s Chris. I don\u2019t know what you mean. To me, it\u2019s math, right? I mean, you\u2019ve got stat and GAAP, you\u2019ve got cash and really, I don\u2019t feel comfortable speculating too much here with you on any potential transaction. So, to me, I just would tell you it will be math. But I mean, we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re comfortable running Talcott off over a longer period of time. We\u2019ve shrunken its risk profile and that any transaction that we would consider has to be, first, economic for us and our shareholders it needs to be a provable or a clean break, potential parties need to take care of our customers and employees. So I mean we know the conditions we\u2019re looking for. And beyond that, I just would ask you to do the math yourself and you make your judgment sound what you think it means. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess was for Chris. And just hearing emphasize Group Benefits as a core business, how do you think about weighing M&A opportunities when you think about P&C, Commercial versus Group? And then I guess, more specifically, you mentioned you\u2019re a top-five player, what would be the benefits, I guess, of becoming even bigger than that? Thanks. Chris Swift : Ryan, thanks for the question. I would just say, from a business and capital allocation perspective, Commercial, Benefits, Personal Lines, Mutual Funds, I mean, we\u2019re comfortable deploying capital into those businesses that make financial and strategic sense. So, specifically, if there\u2019s a benefits opportunity in the marketplace, it\u2019s something we would consider seriously looking at. We like our Group Benefits businesses. You can see the returns, its earnings. It has a concentration a little bit in the large National Accounts base of over 5,000 lives. So, in Doug\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve been trying to grow the small, the middle size of that. We\u2019ve completed our voluntary product suite and we think about A&H more broadly. So, it would be a business that we are now [ph] going to continue to invest in and we think we have capabilities and the brand to effectively compete over the long term. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. And I just had a couple for Doug. I guess, the first one, growth is good in Small Commercial, but again emphasizing the competitive dynamic in the marketplace, is there potentially a need for another investment cycle, I guess, in that business in the near to medium-term, just given what you\u2019re seeing coming out of peers? Doug Elliot : Ryan, I guess, I would answer it this way. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever stopped investing in Small Commercial. There is no question there are a lot of interested parties looking at that segment, trying to participate in that segment. We\u2019ve been at a long time very pleased with last several years of progress and excellent quarter. But this year and next, big priority around digital but capabilities we have in the service center, our selling skills, et cetera. So, I would like you to think about our investment in Small as ongoing and doubling down as we move forward. Ryan Tunis : Okay. And then, in Middle Market, seeing the growth there in new business, if you could just talk a little bit more about what was driving that and how you could see the momentum there playing out through the rest of the year? Doug Elliot : Good question, Ryan. And a little outsized, and certainly quite a bit different than last year first quarter. Largely, as I mentioned in my script, around our verticals, construction had an excellent first quarter, as did marine and some of the other verticals. So, we are still grinding our way in the generalist space of Middle and the growth there was clearly not as robust as it was in these other areas. Our momentum in construction has been very positive over the last couple of years. And in the first quarter, we were awarded two very large athletic arenas in the United States. So, feel good about some of the wins. Again, I think, it was a little outsized, I don\u2019t expect to have four quarters of growth like that in those verticals but I am pleased with the progress. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Thank you. A couple of questions. First, you talked about non-cat weather in the two different segments having sort of offsetting impacts. Can you characterize a non-CAT weather in either segment as -- not relative to last year but relative to expectations, was it unusual, either bigger or less? Doug Elliot : Sure, Jay. I will try to do that for you. When we think about homeowners, as I talked about it, in the non-cat weather category and fire, we were essentially 3.5 points high than our three to five-year average over a period of time. I\u2019d remind you that the early part of the quarter had a lot of West Coast water activity, not just California but really up to the Northwest, got a sizable part of our book on the West Coast. So, we were impacted by that water and also in our Commercial book as well. So, a little bit out of pattern; we felt the pressure from weather, but I think things will snap back in as we go forward. Jay Cohen : So, homeowners was about 3.5 points above a normalized level, is that fair? Doug Elliot : That\u2019s correct. Driving essentially to 3.8 variance that I chatted about, in our homeowners XX. Jay Cohen : Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then, the other question. In personal auto acquisition costs being down, is that a function of lower commissions, less advertising through the AARP channel? What really drive those lower costs? Doug Elliot : Yes. What was driving fundamentally this quarter change was lower marketing activities associated with our personal auto book. So, as I commented, as we feel and continue to feel better about rate adequacy, which is a going to be a quarter-to-quarter march moving through this year and next, we will adjust accordingly, Jay, turning back on those, very specific state-by-state basis. But I do think that run rate, we will not be able to continue at that. You should expect to see some more marketing expense as we feel better about our rate adequacy. Jay Cohen : Yes. Now, that makes sense. Thanks, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Gary Ransom : Good morning. There\u2019s been an increasing discussion on the impact of the plaintiffs\u2019 bar on loss trends, either more lawyers looking for cases or more willing to go to trials or simply more legal representation. Are you seeing anything on that front? Doug Elliot : Gary, we have looked hard at that issue, hard at the data, and with our new claim system that we\u2019ve brought on board last couple of years, better visibility. As I look at the representation rate, it\u2019s up slightly but not in big numbers. So, I do -- I feel slight representation numbers up. What I do see though on our data is a higher -- a quicker trigger to litigation, particularly at the moment around auto liability and also GL. So, we\u2019re watching very quickly those cases that are with representation and how quickly they\u2019re going to litigation and how that is working through our book of business. Gary Ransom : Just as a follow-up, is that -- it\u2019s broad-based. Do you think the industry is responding in pricing? Obviously, they are in commercial auto, but maybe in GL, is there some upward pressure on pricing because of those trends? Doug Elliot : It\u2019s a really good point. I do think the industry is responding to auto, I absolutely agree with you. I think GL, auto liability is an area that needs more attention and would benefit by a bit more discipline across the industry. It\u2019s a line that has our attention, probably differently than a year or two years ago. I look at what we\u2019ve been able to achieve on the pricing side in Middle, in that core Middle, and I think the line, over time, will demand more rate so that we offset some of the trends that we will feel. I don\u2019t think these litigation trends that others and we are talking about are going away anytime soon. Chris Swift : It\u2019s Chris. I just would add, particularly given our book of business more in the Middle, we get exposed through our primary lines. We\u2019re not big umbrella or excess players. In fact, as we think about the future in expanding our risk appetite, it\u2019s one area that really causes us pause on the umbrella, the excess lines. Can we get paid and earn an adequate return? So until we see a little more correction and realism in price and exposure, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to deploy too much capital into excess umbrella lines in GL. Gary Ransom : Right, okay. Should I read anything into the little uptick in renewal pricing that we saw in the first quarter versus last year? Doug Elliot : Certainly, I asked you to read something in on small commercial. And that is we are leaning into some of the signs in our book first auto which we\u2019ve chatted up, but GL. We had some slip and fall type classes over the last three to four quarter that, Gary, we have tuned up our pricing around. And so, those changes are real and they are necessary. As we step back in our Middle Market book and we look at trends, generally, we feel pretty good, Gary, about frequency across our core commercial Middle Market lines, but there\u2019s a debate and discussion we\u2019re having about severity. And as I think about GL, it\u2019s a line that I think you\u2019ll see us be thoughtful and lean into a bit more on the pricing side. It\u2019s just -- we expect that trends are not going to be in the zero and two range, out in 2017 and 2018. I think it\u2019s more likely that we feel a four, five range, and that is clearly not where the market is pricing that line at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Doug, can you give us an indication of how the adjusted auto loss ratio played out over 2016, so we can use that as a base for 2017? Beth Bombara : Yes, Meyer. It\u2019s Beth. I\u2019ll take that question. So, when you think about 2016, we increased our loss picks for accident year of 2016, both in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter. And you may recall that in the fourth quarter, we talked about the fact that it was probably about 6 points that we booked in Q4 that related to earlier quarters. So, you can kind of think about how you\u2019d adjust the fourth quarter loss ratio. So, it really leaves second and third quarter. And the way we look at it -- I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me, is that it\u2019s probably around one to two points of difference you\u2019d expect from what we reported. So, in second quarter, the number we reported would be a little bit high because again we had strengthened the first quarter at that point. And then third quarter, the reported number is probably a little bit low by that amount. And when we kind of put all of that together, as Doug said, we do expect to see the improvement that was embedded in our overall combined ratios that we gave as an outlook back in February. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s certainly helpful. Thanks. And second question, you talked about flattening frequency, again, I\u2019m talking about personal auto. What have you been assuming in the pricing just that you\u2019ve been filing in [indiscernible]? Doug Elliot : Well, our 2017 plan had essentially a mid-single digit total trend outlook. And the reason I say we\u2019re encouraged by first quarter with flat frequency in the 3, 3.5 range of severity, feel like we\u2019re just underneath that. So, a good start to the year. We\u2019ll see as we go forward, again, next couple of quarters but mid single digits is where the entire sector has been running. Fast-track data is now out on fourth quarter, so you\u2019ve got to peek at that. And that has been our lean plus experience into our filing state-by-state. There\u2019s a lot geography and a lot of specificity in terms of territories that obviously loads up an individual state. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your line is open. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Hartford. Following up a little bit on Gary\u2019s question. So, I think what you\u2019re saying is that the sort of rates that you\u2019re taking, 3% or so in Standard Commercial aren\u2019t like keeping up with underlying trend which you thought might be closer to 5. I\u2019ll give you credit, you\u2019re one of the few companies publicly sort of saying that our are underlying commercial will be deteriorating this year in your guidance. Are we still at a point where you\u2019re looking at 12 months margins are coming down or can you sort of offset that with better risk selection? Doug Elliot : Bob, this is Doug. First thing I would say is when we think about our operating margins, I\u2019d separate Small from Middle, just they\u2019re very different marketplaces. But overall, our theme, my comments back 90 days ago, as I look out across, in general pricing has been at or slightly below loss trends for some period of time, several quarters at least. And the math on that, as you roll into 2017, unless you\u2019re predicting very encouraging severity signs across auto, GL and compensation and the medical, it\u2019s hard for the math to work in any other direction but pressure on core margins. So that\u2019s my own personal view. This is several cycles for me. I\u2019m encouraged by our pricing lift in the first quarter though. So, the other side of that is the 90 basis-point lift in pricing, both in Small and a little bit of benefit in Middle, I\u2019m encouraged, encouraged with our discipline. And maybe we have a bottoming, if you will, on the pricing side in Commercial. That would be a good thing because we\u2019ve worked hard to achieve the operating levels we\u2019re at. Very pleased about those levels but I don\u2019t want to give them away. And that is a debate we\u2019re having everyday across our lines, across all our businesses but in a very segmented way. Did that help? Bob Glasspiegel : Yes, very much. Switching gears, just on your acquisition target. Is there a size of what the ideal type company and how big you could go on an acquisition? Chris Swift : Bob, it\u2019s Chris. I would say, just a couple thoughts on M&A in general that we\u2019ve been proactive in the marketplace. We\u2019re very disciplined about our approach. It has to make strategic and financial sense. So, we think in terms of a bolt-on and/or extensions into adjacent markets that would be a little less complex to integrating into The Hartford. But I would also say we\u2019re open to larger opportunities that accelerate our growth in markets, product lines, geographies that we want to be in. That, I would characterize as a target that has anywhere as between $500 million and $1 billion of premium. So, I don\u2019t know if that helps size, your size question, but I think that would be something digestible. But again, it has to make the financial sense, and we\u2019ve being disciplined, given we\u2019ve been at this over the last four years. And we\u2019ve said no to a lot of opportunities. So, that\u2019s what I would say, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Randy Binner : Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wanted -- I think this question is for Doug. I just wanted to jump back and kind of weave together some of those commentaries. So, it sounds like in kind of the I\u2019ll call it, the Small Commercial or Middle Market book, your severity trend is maybe in their loss trend rather is more in maybe in the 4% to 5% range. But then, drilling in on commercial auto, I think I heard your comments to say that you were planning on mid-single-digit loss trends, so call it 4% to 5%. But then, you\u2019re below that now. So, I just wanted to clarify that I\u2019m kind of hearing that right because some of the loss trend data points would begin in this earnings season would indicate that commercial auto is still kind of higher single digits and really is not stabilizing. So, I\u2019m just trying to tie that all together that you do see commercial auto trend stabilizing here. Doug Elliot : The commercial auto results, I\u2019d start by saying, are not acceptable and are not acceptable in our book, and we\u2019re determined to continue to work at that. In the Middle Market, over the past four years, we\u2019ve put 37 points of rate into the book of business. So, good news is that with re-underwriting and rate, it\u2019s a much healthier book but we\u2019re also dealing with the same dynamics in the marketplace relative to driving behavior that we\u2019ve faced in Personal Lines. So, Middle has been a pricing story after years of re-underwriting. I feel pretty good about our core book. In Small Commercial, we face some pressures over the last three quarters that to me have also come from the Personal Lines re-underwriting. And that\u2019s a book where in our micro end we\u2019ve got many businesses that have 1 and 2 and 3 employees. So I think there is a lot we can learn from Personal Lines. We\u2019re not pleased about our performance in Small Commercial and the auto side, we\u2019re addressing it through not only underwriting and pricing. And we still feel pressure on the bodily injury side of those trends in both Small and Middle with auto. So, I\u2019m feeling mid-single-digit pressure on severity in our Commercial auto book and I don\u2019t expect that to change, because I think that\u2019s largely what we see out in the external environment and what our view of the external data is saying to us. And therefore, we\u2019re building our action plans around that. Randy Binner : Are there particular kind of sub-segment to commercial auto though that are still kind of spiking into the high single digits? I\u2019m just trying to reconcile some of the data points we\u2019re hearing out there. Because I know you\u2019re going to have a bigger look at the market and then the fast-track data you discussed with 2. But are there still pockets that are seeing kind of bigger lifts especially in BI severity? Doug Elliot : Well, there certainly is a geography twist to that. So, there are ZIP Codes and areas of the country where we feel more pressure than others. There are class dynamics to it. In Small Commercial, I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we have changed our referral triggers on several of those classes that used to just hit the glass for quotes and run right through. Now, we\u2019ll take those quotes at a technology level and bring them back to an underwriter for more-strict underwriting. So, yes, I would say both class and geography are definitely triggers that we\u2019re looking at and impact an aggregate performance that needs more pricing and more underwriting. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. I had a question first on the auto book. I appreciate the additional disclosure this quarter. When I look at the underlying loss ratio for the first quarter, we see the year-over-year improvement but I\u2019m thinking, when I think about going forward, seasonally auto does run stronger margins in the first quarter. But does the fact that you\u2019re going to be earning in more rate over the rest of three quarters, change some of the seasonality that you expect when you think about the underlying loss ratio, Q2 to Q4 versus what you printed in the first quarter? Doug Elliot : Elyse, this is Doug. Our plan did kind of play that. So largely, our expectations for the year and our guidance stands as is. So, yes, you\u2019re absolutely right. This seasonality that we\u2019ve seen in the past, we expect to continue. And essentially our pricing objectives are being met. And we continue to work hard to achieve the next three quarters, so that we can have a full year and get this back on track. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then, last quarter, you guys provided on some color around the retention within the auto book in terms of kind of by loss ratio. The retention did come down on the overall book a little bit in the quarter. But, when you would look by loss ratio band in a way, did you see kind of the same dynamics where you\u2019re seeing a greater drop in retention within some of the more-higher loss ratio part of the book? Doug Elliot : We did, Elyse. We saw a very similar pattern, which is actually why we didn\u2019t put the exhibit. It would have been very similar to what you saw 90 days ago. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then, Chris, when we, last quarter, discussed the possibility of you guys putting into sale of Talcott, you had mentioned the potential proceeds from a sale that your preference would be to use that towards managing down leverage as well as M&A. Subsequent to that, we\u2019ve addressed it earlier in this call, there\u2019s spill going through Connecticut. Does the ability to sell parts of Talcott, and so obviously different sales could happen at different times, and the level of proceeds would come in at different periods of time. Does that change how you would consider thinking about what you might do with the proceeds? Chris Swift : Yes. Elyse, I would say, it\u2019s got very tactical in an area that we\u2019re not going to speculate or comment on. One, I\u2019d remind you that bill is only through half of the legislature, so the other half needs to approve it and the Governor needs to sign it. As I said, we expect that to happen in June. And then, we\u2019ll evaluate things from there. But, I think it\u2019s way too premature to go down the path that you are going down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is open. Ian Gutterman : Hi. Thank you. Doug, you mentioned in your script about being able to restart marketing for AARP in the second half. Should I take that as a sign that you feel pretty good about the progress you\u2019re making to have the confidence to do that? Doug Elliot : Ian, you should feel good that we are pleased with the early start to progress. I\u2019ll remind you, and this is a multiyear effort, so one quarter does not make the goal we have in mind. But pleased about the early signals of our initiatives across underwriting and claims and pricing, et cetera. And again, you can see it because we shared transparently, there\u2019s a direct side of this financial dynamic and then there\u2019s the agency piece. And our top line is a bit more moderated in the agency side, so we\u2019re not shrinking early as much as we are in total, and that\u2019s something that is a clear focus for us. We\u2019ve got terrific partners at AARP. And we are intent upon stabilizing this book and looking for opportunities to grow going forward. That is our goal. And I think we\u2019re going to be at a healthier spot in the second half of the year to achieve that. And as such, we will direct marketing activities accordingly. Ian Gutterman : Got it. I mean, I assume you if felt that you still didn\u2019t have your arms around this, you wouldn\u2019t be thinking about growing the book then. Is that a fair assessment? Doug Elliot : That\u2019s a very fair assessment. Ian Gutterman : Okay, great. And just a broader question for everyone to take it on reserves. Obviously, you said the last few years, you disclosed in the K the range about the midpoint and it\u2019s continued to creep up but that hasn\u2019t really shown up yet in reserve releases. And I\u2019m just wondering, philosophically, how you guys think about that. Is the goal sort of to keep growing that range above the midpoint each year and sort of keep the base reserve releases around zero and strengthen the balance sheet for the future or is it just that most of that move above the midpoint has been in the recent accident years and they\u2019re just not seasoned enough and over the next, call it, near to midterm, once it gets more seasoned, we\u2019ll start to see sort of more consistent releases? Chris Swift : It\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll let Beth comment also, but philosophically, there is no target there. I mean, we evaluate reserves every quarter and try to use our best math, our best judgment, both on what\u2019s happening and the potential scenarios, sensitivities going forward. So, that really informs sort of our view of what our carried position is compared to the actuarial indications. So, I would dissuade your mind into thinking in terms of a math equation, program releases should start to come because it\u2019s really facts and circumstances. And again, personally speaking for one member of our team, I mean, we are watching inflation very closely. We see wage pressures; we see litigation pressures in other areas. So, the wage sensitivity we have in our book and comp in disability is material. So, we want to be very, very prudent, have those accident years seasoned with great deal of certainty before we deal with them. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ms. Purtill, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in The Hartford.  Just as a reminder, we will hold our annual general meeting of shareholders on May 17th in The Hartford\u2019s offices here in Hartford, Connecticut. So, don\u2019t forget to vote. And if you have any additional questions about our quarter, please do not hesitate to follow up with Investor Relations. We wish you all a good weekend. Goodbye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Christopher Swift : Thanks, Sabra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford\u2019s second quarter core earnings increased significantly over the prior year. Each business segment contributed to the results with clear progress in personal auto and solid investment returns, including favorable limited partnership results. Capital generation remains strong and we returned over $800 million to shareholders in the first-half of the year, including share repurchases and dividends, while repaying$416 million of debt. Performance over the past year increased core earnings ROE to 9.3%, or a 11.3%, excluding Talcott Resolution. One of the most important accomplishments in the quarter was the improvement in personal auto results. I\u2019m encouraged by the frequency and severity trends we\u2019re seeing in the loss experience. Adjusting second quarter 2016 results for the unfavorable development during the year, we delivered a 2.4 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio this quarter. While we have more work to do, the quality of the auto book is much better today due to the success of the profitability initiatives we launched over the past 18 months, and we are on track to meet the combined ratio goal we set for the year. With improved profitability, we will increase marketing spend in the second-half of 2017 in selected areas to begin growing new business again. Our 30-year-plus relationship with AARP remain strong and we are working in close partnership as we transition to growth. Commercial lines achieved an excellent 90.9 underlying combined ratio, reflecting disciplined underwriting in markets that remain competitive. Small commercial again delivered outstanding results with 6% written premium growth and a superb underlying combined ratio of 87.2, despite some pressure in auto. We will continue to focus on growing in this important segment of the market and are investing significantly in data and digital capabilities that are enhancing underwriting and improving agent and customer experience. I\u2019m confident we are well-positioned to continue to lead this small commercial insurance market into the future. The Middle Market underlying combined ratio was 94.9, a 3 point deterioration, mainly due to several large property losses occurring late in the second quarter. The competitive environment in Middle Market remains challenging for both new and renewal business, which is likely to persist in the second-half of the year. We will continue to prioritize disciplined risk selection in retention of our best accounts while competing in areas where it makes sense. Group benefits continue to deliver excellent results. Core earnings increased 33% to $61 million, resulting in core earnings margin of 6.7%. The increase in earnings reflected improved group life mortality and better disability experience with strong persistency supporting top line growth. The voluntary business while still small is building momentum with our new hospital indemnity product now approved and quoting in 44 states. We\u2019re focused on growing this business and are investing in new and enhanced capabilities to increase penetration with agents and brokers who specialize in this market. Mutual funds had another great quarter, with total assets under management reaching $108 billion. In the first-half of 2017, the segment achieved positive net flows in excess of $2.6 billion, with strong investment performance across the fund lineup. I\u2019m optimistic about the continued growth of this business with our two outstanding subadvisers, Wellington and Schroders, and our recent entry into the smart beta asset class. Before turning the call over to Doug, I\u2019d like to make a few comments about the city of Hartford. Currently, the city is in the midst of a significant financial crisis with its future very much tied to the actions of the state of Connecticut. As the company founded and headquartered in Hartford for over 200 years, we remain vested in the city\u2019s future and believe its success is vital to the state\u2019s economy and overall strength. While the city faces immense challenges, we believe it also holds enormous potential. Connecticut in the Greater Hartford area offer tremendous quality of life and enjoy one of the most educated and talented workforces in the country. In many ways, the seeds of the city\u2019s future success have already been sown in the form of recent investments in new housing, education and transportation. These green shoots of progress are why The Hartfordm along with other large insurance employers recently offered financial support to help supplement the city\u2019s finances, contingent on the development of a comprehensive and sustainable solution for the capital city. We strongly encourage elected leaders and other key stakeholders to come together to implement the long-term solutions necessary to address the financial challenges facing the city and state and continue to cultivate Hartford as a vibrant urban center, capable of attracting critical talent of the future. In closing, I\u2019m proud of the strong financial results we delivered this quarter and the progress we\u2019ve made in the first-half of 2017, which put us on track to meet the outlook we provided earlier this year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Good morning, everyone. As Chris said, we\u2019re very pleased with our second quarter across Property & Casualty and Group Benefits. Commercial Lines delivered strong results against the backdrop of a competitive market. In Personal Lines, auto improvement improved consistent with our expectations, and Group Benefits had an excellent quarter with strong earnings driven by favorable trends in both group life and disability. Let me get right into the second quarter details on each of our business units. In Commercial Lines, the combined ratio was 94.6, improving 0.4 point from 2016, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and prior year development, partially offset by slightly higher current accident year loss before catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 90.9, deteriorating 1.1 points. This is largely driven by commercial auto consistent with trends in first quarter 2017, and large loss volatility in Middle Market property. Market conditions continue to be competitive, particularly in Middle Market and national accounts, and we\u2019re executing effectively the balance retention, margins and new business opportunities. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.5%, up slightly from the first quarter of 2017, with the highest increases continuing to come from commercial auto. Small Commercial had another strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.2. Written premium was up 6%, resulting from strong retention and $147 million of new business, including $14 million from Maxum. In Middle Market, the underlying combined ratio was 94.9, deteriorating 3 points from 2016, mainly due to several large losses in our property and marine books of business. These losses can be volatile and our results for the first six months are within our longer-term run rate. Written premium decreased 2% versus prior year. New business production of $107 million was up 14%. Although, recent loss cost trends in line, such as workers\u2019 comp and general liability have been favorable, our view is that, we must consider historical trends in our decision-making, given the long-term nature of these liabilities. Overall, I believe, we struck an appropriate balance between new business, pricing and underwriting quality in this competitive marketplace. On the in-force book, we took targeted non-renewal actions on a program for service and maintenance contractors. Excluding these actions, our retention remain solid and consistent with prior quarters. Middle Market operating expenses were also higher in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the talent and technology necessary to compete in this business long-term. Moving to Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 95.9 deteriorated half a point. This was driven by a slightly higher loss ratio in auto liability again consistent with our results in first quarter 2017. Written premium and Specialty Commercial was down 3% for the quarter, largely the result of slower of slightly lower new and renewal premium in national accounts, partially offset by continued growth in bond. Moving to Personal Lines, the second quarter combined ratio was 101.4, improving 11.2 points from a year ago. 8.9 points of the improvement was driven by a change from unfavorable prior year development in second quarter of 2016 to slightly favorable development this year. The expenses and catastrophe losses were also lower versus 2016. The underlying combined ratio of 92.6 improved 1.6 points. This was primarily driven by improving auto trends, partially offset by homeowner results with the homeowner\u2019s underlying combined ratio for the second quarter of 77.6, deteriorating 3.4 points versus last year due to higher non-catastrophe weather losses. In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio improved to 99.1. After adjusting second quarter 2016 for net development affecting the quarter, the 2017 auto loss ratio has improved approximately 1.3 points. The expense ratio was also down this year by 1.1 points, due primarily to reduce new business acquisition expenses. As a result, on an adjusted basis, the underlying combined ratio for the second quarter of 2017 improved 2.4 points. This progress is right in line with our expectations, as our pricing, underwriting, and agency management actions begin to earn their way into our book of business. Auto loss cost trends have been relatively stable and moderate in recent quarters more in line with historical levels. Frequency trend is essentially flat and severity trend is in the low single digits, both improving from our experience in 2016 and 2015. The year-to-date auto combined ratio was 99.1. We expect the second-half of the year to run higher due to normal seasonality. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our full-year auto combined ratio outlook of 101 to 103, which included approximately 1 point for catastrophes. This represents 2 to 3 points of expected improvement in the underlying auto loss ratio for the full-year. Personal Lines written premium for second quarter 2017 was down 7%. Consistent with recent quarters, our marketing spend was down versus a year ago, resulting in lower new business as we address our rate needs with added filings and improved underwriting segmentation. We have made substantial progress to-date. And as we noted last quarter, we are increasing our AARP new business marketing efforts over the second-half of the year. Due to the lead times between marketing and customer conversion, we expect to see positive growth in AARP direct new business premium late in the fourth quarter. Turning to Group Benefits, we had an excellent second quarter with core earnings of $61 million and a margin of 6.7%. The total loss ratio improved this quarter by 2.4 points versus prior year, with favorable results in both group life and disability. In second quarter 2016, we experienced some volatility in our group life results, with higher than normal severity. Results in 2017 have been better than expected, with improved group life results and favorable incidence and recovery trends in group disability. The improvement in both lines can be attributed to our ongoing execution in underwriting, pricing and claims management, as well as favorable trends relative to historical experience. We continue to expect the long-term core earnings margin of this business to be in the 6% range. On the top line, second quarter fully insured ongoing premiums increased 2%. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business remains strong at approximately 90% and fully insured ongoing sales were $67 million. Although, down from prior year, it was a solid sales quarter and we\u2019re well-positioned for a strong second-half of the year. In summary, our Property & Casualty and Group Benefit businesses delivered excellent second quarter results. Now halfway through the year, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the consistent execution of our team and the performance of our businesses. We\u2019re maintaining our disciplined and balanced approach to deliver profitable growth. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to cover our other segments, investment performance and capital management activities before taking your questions. Our P&C other segments had core earnings of $18 million compared with a loss of $154 million last year, which included $174 million of adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves. As a reminder in the past, our annual A&E study was completed in the second quarter. After the purchase of the A&E reinsurance cover from National Indemnity last year, we moved this annual study to the fourth quarter, so there is no impact from A&E in this quarter\u2019s results. Turning to mutual funds. Strong net flows and market appreciation as well as the addition of the Schroders funds drove total segment AUM up 18% to $107.7 billion and core earnings up 20% to $24 million. We continue to benefit from strong investment performance with 77% of our funds beating their peers on a five-year basis. Sales of $6.2 billion generated positive net flows of $1.3 billion in the quarter. Through the first-half of 2017, net inflows of $2.6 billion are up significantly, compared with net outflows of $600 million in the first-half of 2016. Talcott\u2019s core earnings were $80 million, down from $91 million in the second quarter of 2016. Over the past four quarters, VA contract counts decreased 10% and fixed annuity contracts decreased 6%. Talcott\u2019s statutory surplus was $4.3 billion at quarter-end. We expect Talcott to pay $300 million dividend to the holding company in the third quarter for a total of $600 million in 2017. In the Corporate segment, we had core losses of $52 million compared with core losses of $50 million in the prior year. Operating expenses in the second quarter of last year benefited from the reversal of a legal accrual, which masked the benefit over the past year of the decline in interest expense, resulting from the reduction in debt. On an all in basis, the Corporate segment had a net loss of $540 million, reflecting a pension settlement charge of $488 million after-tax, or $1.31 per diluted share, due to transfer of approximately $1.6 billion, or 29% of our U.S. defined benefit pension obligation to Prudential. As a reminder, the pension charge includes $344 million loss that was previously included in AOCI. So while the charge to net income was $1.31 per diluted share, the impact of book value per share was lower at $0.39 The investment portfolio continues to perform well with generally stable portfolio yields, strong LP returns and modest impairments. Total LP investment income was $48 million before tax for annualized yield of 8% compared with $40 million, or 6.1% in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding LPs, the total before tax annualized yield was 4.05% this quarter compared to 4.14% in second quarter 2016. To conclude on earnings, second quarter core earnings per diluted share were $1.04, up significantly from $0.31 in second quarter 2016, which included a $0.44 per share charge for A&E. Excluding that charge, core earnings per share were up almost 40%, which includes the effect of the 7% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The improvement in core earnings was primarily driven by better personal lines results, along with higher core earnings from each of the other segments with the exception of Talcott. Our core earnings ROE for the past 12 months was 9.3%, up 1.9 points from a year ago and our core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 11.3%. P&C core earnings ROE was 13.1%, a very strong result despite personal lines results being below our long-term target, while group benefits was 11.2%. Turning to shareholders equity, book value per diluted share was $46.84, down slightly from a year ago. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share was up 2% since June 30th, 2016. Before taking questions I wanted to provide a quick update on capital management. During the quarter we repurchased $325 million of stock and through July 25th we purchased about 1.6 million shares for $85 million for third quarter to-date. This leaves approximately $565 million available under the $1.3 billion equity repurchase authorization for 2017. To conclude, this quarter\u2019s results demonstrate continued strong and steady operating results with consistent and disciplined execution in competitive markets. We are pleased with the continued progress in personal auto where our results are clearly improving and commercial lines, group benefits, and mutual fund results remained strong, supported by top line growth. I will now turn the call over to Sabra, so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you Beth. Just a reminder that we have about 30 minutes for Q&A, if you have to drop off or if we run out of time before we get your question, please email or call the investor relations team and we will follow up with you as soon as possible today. Heidi, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. First question is on the personal auto, it looks like you are making a big progress in the turnaround. I just wonder if you\u2019re looking already further, what\u2019s your profitability long-term target and how quickly can you get there? Doug Elliot : Thanks Kai, this is Doug. As we\u2019ve described in prior calls, our goal in the auto line is to achieve a 96.5 ex-ex auto target, so that is our goal. It isn\u2019t quite at our longer-term profitability targets, but it is certainly our near-term focus and we intend to do everything we can to get there by the end of 2018. Kai Pan : Okay and then the \u2013 sort of like the second half higher, so in order to achieve this year\u2019s target, second half must be higher than the first half in terms of personal auto, the whole combined ratio. I just wonder, you mentioned about a higher seasonality, how much that\u2019s contributing to it or how much \u2013 do you have any plan to increase the expense ratio as you try to grow your business again? Doug Elliot : Kai, let me try to take each of the piece little bit separate, so traditionally seasonality has impacted our auto and homeowners loss ratios, but certainly we\u2019re talking about auto now. Fourth quarter has been our most challenging weather auto quarter and we expect the second half of 2017 to be in line with prior years. So that\u2019s why the numbers are working as they do and as you see our full year guidance, you know and you can back into what the second half of the year will look like. On \u2013 I think I\u2019ll leave it at that. Beth, is there anything you want to add to that? Beth Bombara : No, I\u2019ll just follow up with the comment on the expense ratio. I mean, yes if we do increase as our plan is, our marketing spend in the second half, we would expect to see some uptick in that expense ratio, but again that was contemplated overall when we provided our guidance at the beginning of the year. So as Doug said, overall we see things performing very consistently with our expectations. Doug Elliot : And Kai, just in closing, we expect this year on a loss ratio basis in personal auto. We\u2019re expecting two to three points of improvement, so we\u2019re having back to offset, first half of the year was right in line with that and as we play out the second half, we expect to achieve those targets. Kai Pan : That\u2019s great. Last one if I may, there is a lot of talk in the marketplace about digital small business insurance, you guys are market leader there, I just wonder how do you position yourself both your internal initiatives, as well if you are looking out if there is other opportunity through acquisitions? Christopher Swift : Kai, it\u2019s Chris. What I would say is, there is a lot of activity in the fintech space in general. If I understood your question with money and activity and obviously we\u2019re very proud of our leadership in the small commercial space in general. We participate in those activities through our venture group whether it be finding partnerships, doing experiments, allocating capital, the startups, so we have all types of activities in that space. And I said in my prepared comments, we are going to continue to be a leader in this space as things continue to change. So, a lot of our investment dollars are targeted towards a more of a digital business model. And if you think of some of the M&A activity that\u2019s occurring in the space and particular that what we did a little over a year ago acquiring Maxim, Maxim was specifically targeted to a small commercial end of the market, so with our technology, with E&S capabilities with enhancing digital experiences, I feel good about the path that we are on. Doug Elliot : Kai, I guess the only thing I would add is that, there has been a awful lot of discussion about not only disruption, but clearly the frontend sales quoting and changes that may occur there. I\u2019d also remind you that in addition to those skills required, you know there is still an awful lot behind that is important to the equation, so having world-class server centers, having a terrific claim operation, having dynamic sales professionals, right; having the data and analytics and the science behind the engines, so we\u2019re working on all facets of our small commercial operations. We do see change coming, we see it probably quicker today than we did a year ago, we\u2019re being responsive to that change and we are working hard to take advantage of it as it comes. Kai Pan : Thank you so much for all of the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Joshua Shanker : Good morning everyone. Two questions, hopefully quick ones, can we talk about the cash tax rate as opposed to the GAAP tax rate for this quarter and what the outlook is for that? Beth Bombara : Sure. So from a cash tax rate, when you are thinking about our earnings, keep in mind that we obviously do benefit from the utilization of net operating losses, but given the amount of preference items that we have, both from a dividends received deduction and the tax exempt interest on municipal bonds, we do find ourselves in a position of paying AMT tax, so actually from a cash tax perspective, if you are looking at our GAAP earnings, we\u2019re probably paying a rate in cash that\u2019s a little bit higher than the statutory rate. Joshua Shanker : And do you expect that to persist for the next 12 months or so? Beth Bombara : Yes, as we look at our forecast going forward and again continuing to utilize net operating losses, but continuing to see ourselves in an AMT position, yes that situation would continue. Joshua Shanker : And looking over the statistical supplement on Page 18, you gave some disclosures about rate increases both for auto and home, obviously the problems have been in auto, but it looks like you are very much seeking rate increases in home as well? And also seems that the GAAP between the written price increases and the earned price increases isn\u2019t very different. I\u2019m trying to think about going out into the coming year, shouldn\u2019t there be a earned lag on all of the work that you\u2019ve done that should accelerate through the year or we\u2019re already kind of at the full earn through of the amount of work you\u2019ve doing. Doug Elliot : Let me work each side of the question, so the first piece is that, we\u2019re working equally as hard on homeowners and actually if you extend that over the past three to four we\u2019ve been working diligently at homeowners for a multi-years dealing with cat zones and deductibles etcetera, so that\u2019s the reason why you see the homeowners pricing as is. On the automobile side, on a written basis, I would suggest that as we look out we expect to continue see at least over the next couple of quarters more quarters in the pricing realm written like you\u2019re seeing in June that\u2019s second quarter. The earned pricing is starting to catch up, so as I think about the last four quarters, we\u2019ve moved on an earned auto basis from 6 to 7 to 8 to 9 and that will approach 10 as we move into the third quarter. So, yes, it\u2019s catching up, and at some point if there is a deceleration in our auto written, because our rate adequacy improves. There will be a point where an earned is greater than written, but that\u2019s all math, right, and we\u2019ll see that as it comes. Joshua Shanker : Okay. Well, thank you and good luck. Christopher Swift : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher : Good morning. First question, Chris, just with all the recent news articles on Talcott, just a quick question on that. How should we think about you holding out for the best possible value in a potential sale versus the strategic flexibility that a sale will give you if you sell sooner versus later even if it\u2019s at a bit of a discount, what you view is intrinsic? So just wanted to get an update on just overall view on that? Christopher Swift : Thank you. You\u2019re going to be disappointed. I really just feel at this point just speculation on a transaction that the whole theory behind holding, selling just is not helpful at this point in time. I think, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on saying that, we\u2019ve run Talcott off over the last five years. We\u2019re pretty comfortable continuing to do that. But at some point in time, we\u2019re not the natural owner of it going forward. So why don\u2019t we just leave it as that that Talcott is contributing the way it is. And if anything is done, it will always be based on an economic, conclusion for shareholders. And I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in our approach over the last five years as we\u2019ve restructured the operation. But beyond that, Tom, it\u2019s just \u2013 now is not the appropriate time to comment. Thomas Gallagher : I had to give it a shot. The \u2013 just a question for Doug. Just curious how you\u2019re feeling about workers\u2019 comp results, and any signs of claims inflation coming through yet, or still pretty favorable performance there? Doug Elliot : Tom, we\u2019re feeling very good about our workers\u2019 comp book of business, both Small Commercial, which workers\u2019 comps are a big part of our profile and also Middle Market and National Accounts Casualty. So our trends very consistent frequency severity, medical severity, et cetera. So in general, all the signs inside the book are in very good shape. It\u2019s also causing a bit of competition in the marketplace. I think people are seeing good numbers on the worker\u2019s comp side. So competing effectively like where we are if we have a strong value prop in the comp marketplace continue to do so, but also drawing some lines, particularly in Middle Market where we see at times some very aggressive behavior. We\u2019re trying to make good economic choices and I like where we are with our comp decisions. Thomas Gallagher : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Two questions. First, Beth, I\u2019m just curious, I think, originally in your plans, you\u2019re planning on taking $500 million to $600, million of dividends out of Talcott this year. I know you did the \u2013 I believe 250 in the first quarter. Have you applied for the dividends, or taken the dividend yet for the second-half of the year? Beth Bombara : Yes, Brian, so we planned for $600 million of dividends from Talcott this year, we took $300 million in January. And then, as I said, we anticipate taking $300 million this quarter, so sometime in August or September. Brian Meredith : August/September. So have you applied for it? I\u2019m just curious. Beth Bombara : Yes. So typically, when we apply for a dividend, it comes out very shortly thereafter. So now we have not put an application in yet. But again, we anticipate doing that sometime in August or September. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. And then, Doug, I\u2019m just curious looking at your Commercial Lines, what\u2019s going on with the renewal written pricing, it kind of picking up a little bit here. How far away are we from that kind of matching loss trend and maybe seeing some stabilization in the underlying combined ratios \u2013 loss ratios there? Doug Elliot : Good question, Brian. Number one, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pleased with our overall pricing in second quarter, just up slightly from first quarter. So in aggregate sense, pleased with the stability there. I think everybody knows though that auto is a driver. So we\u2019re pleased our progress in auto. My focus is in the casualty lines and what\u2019s happening in property. And there we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019d like to see a little more rate. I think over time, as carriers look at their actual results, we will see adjustments. But over the next couple of quarters, I\u2019m not sure, I see anything in the near-term that says the quarters are going to behave differently. Our Small Commercial results, as we share with you in our supplement, good pricing in Small Commercial, it\u2019s middle, where there\u2019s an awful lot of competition. And so our new business is down and I think there\u2019s a direct correlation between us deciding to walk away and just not seeing enough economic activity that makes sense for us. We\u2019ll gauge that and share with you as we go through the next couple of quarters what the results look like. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jay Cohen : Yes, couple of questions. First, on the personal auto side, you talked about frequency and severity seemingly reverting back to a more normalized trend. I\u2019m wondering how much of that is due to the actions you\u2019ve taken? How much of it is due to just the normal variability in overall trends? Doug Elliot : Jay, very difficult to understand and be able to determine. But I would say this. We watch the fast track signals carefully. They are a quarter in arrears and you can get the data. So we always match our statistics against fast track, and so we\u2019ve looked at first quarter. I do believe, though, that the actions we\u2019ve taken over the past 18 months are clearly driving some of the positive change we see in our book of business. So \u2013 and as you look at the overall signals in the marketplace through fast track, you still see some bodily injury pressure that hasn\u2019t totally gone away, it\u2019s still there. We feel it in Commercial and we still see a bit of it in Personal Lines. But in general, I feel like the work we\u2019re doing across our class plans and through our agency plans are having a very positive impact on our Personal Line results and we continue to play this story out. Jay Cohen : Thanks, Doug. The other question on Talcott. If there were going to be a disposition, let\u2019s say for a minute, that it\u2019s below gap book value. What are the tax implications for the company for disposing of it at that price? Beth Bombara : So, jay, it\u2019s Beth. I mean, so first of all, it gets a little complicated talking about tax impacts on hypothetical transactions. The one thing that I will point out when you think about that is that, the tax basis of Talcott is lower than the GAAP basis. So the tax basis is probably more in line with the statutory book values. I don\u2019t know if that helps you in your thinking, but again, tax and tax impacts are always really based on actual terms and \u2013 of a transaction, so it\u2019s kind of hard to comment hypothetically. Jay Cohen : Yes, and I appreciate the complexity, but that that comment is definitely helpful. Thanks, Beth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Good morning. Doug, couple of questions on auto, if we can dig into that. So you talked about increasing marketing spend in the back-half of the year and the timing for subsequent growth. Can you give us a sense based on your intention of how much of a loss ratio impact there is as new business starts to pick up? Doug Elliot : Meyer, that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m trying to figure out how I want to answer that. I don\u2019t think I want to give you a number. I mean, in general, we\u2019ve got indicators across all our lines of business and in terms of what we expect, given levels of new business. Given our class plan, I would say this. Our signals offer our new business in 2017 are showing that it might be the best new business year from a quality and a loss ratio performance we\u2019ve had in many years. And so as I look at the frequencies and our new what we\u2019re putting on the books today, I look at our class plan work, et cetera. I\u2019m very encouraged by the early signs of this year. So, our new business penalty and what we\u2019re putting on the books could be rather minor. I want to go out on a limb, it\u2019s early. The year hasn\u2019t played out and we obviously want to pick up our pace with growth and we\u2019re targeted around our AARP Direct customer segment. But at the moment, I\u2019m not worried about that. I\u2019m feeling very comfortable with the progress we\u2019ve made, I think, we\u2019re going to have good pricing at adequate terms to be competitive in the marketplace long-term. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s actually helpful. And on the Commercial side, I guess, I\u2019m a little surprised that we\u2019re still seeing year-over-year deterioration, because I thought that commercial auto rate increases were already earning their way in. Was that a weather-related issue, or it was my timing loss? Doug Elliot : It was a little bit more, particularly to Small Commercial. So our Middle Market book has really been written under \u2013 underwritten over the past three to four years and pretty good shape. It\u2019s just been a matter of trying to keep up with loss trend, which we\u2019ve been trying to do with pricing in Middle Market. In the Small end, we had a little bit of pressure over the past three quarters. And so we have leaned into not only pricing, but also some underwriting actions. We\u2019ve triggered a bit more referral activity to our underwriters to look at a series of actions in our small commercial book. The business is down slightly. It\u2019s causing a little bit of a overhang on our overall growth, probably a point on our overall Small Commercial growth. But I think it\u2019s necessary that line is now starting to behave better or combines or improving. And over the next several quarters, we\u2019ll be in better shape in Small Commercial auto. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb : Thanks very much. First question I had was on the Prudential or the pension risk transfer deal that Hartford have with Prudential. Is there a benefit to ongoing earnings there? Beth Bombara : Thanks, Jay. So first of all, we were very pleased to enter into that transaction, reduced our pension liability. From a GAAP earnings perspective, I would say, in the short-term, it\u2019s probably a little bit of a negative just given the nuances of pension accounting. Again, over the long-term in a volatility that comes from changes in assumption and so forth. We see this as a very favorable transaction for us. Jay Gelb : Okay. And then on the rating agency debt-to-capital, it was 25.6% in the second quarter, but that includes the pension liability. So if we adjust for the pension risk transfer deal, what would the rating agency debt-to-capital be? Beth Bombara : So again, the transactions settled as of June 30. So it does take that into consideration what we\u2019ve disclosed in the financial supplement. I will remind you that we are right now we did issue the Glen Meadow hybrid in February and that was from about \u2013 that was $500 million, which is there to prefund June 2018 security that we intend to repay. So again, adjusting for that, we would expect that our debt-to-cap ratio would come down. Jay Gelb : Okay. Thank you. And then, Chris, on Small Commercial, we\u2019ve seen a lot of clear interest from generally new competitors in terms of getting in the space, both on agency and direct basis. Hartford is obviously a major player in Small Commercial. Can you tell us about what Hartford is doing to make sure it defends its competitive position? Christopher Swift : Sure, Jay. I mean, I would say that again the amount of new business we write the volume of our book already speak to the results of investing in this business significantly over really the last 30 years. So you don\u2019t have 1.1 million customers. You don\u2019t have $3.5 billion, $4 billion of premium by accident. And as Doug said, whether it be service centers, whether it be digital experiences, whether it be self-service capabilities. I mean, we\u2019re in the midst of, I\u2019ll call it, the next wave of digital tools that we\u2019re rolling out. I would also say, as Doug mentioned, I mean, there will be always the need for advice in, I think, risk products. No matter what size of a Small Commercial you want to define from the smallest to the largest and it\u2019s incumbent upon carriers and our distribution partners to figure out the best way to get those customers advice. So \u2013 but the whole \u2013 all aspects of the business model are important from a customer experience side. It\u2019s not just acquiring customers. It\u2019s servicing, its billing, ease of audit. And more importantly, in the moment of truth, when there is a claim, I mean, you have to have a an experience that engenders customers that want to renew with you into the next period. So we\u2019re focused on all parts of the value chain and keep it at a high level, Jay, you would not expect us to give any secret sauce out on the call here today. Jay Gelb : Of course. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. I had a couple for Doug and I think at least one for Beth. But I guess for Doug, just thinking about what\u2019s going on a commercial auto. How we\u2019re feeling about the peaks from the prior years, because we had a comment again this quarter that it was laying on the accident year results. But there was no additional strengthening. So I\u2019m just curious how \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing is informing, I guess, the past accident years, because that was a positive surprise, I thought that there was no additional unfavorable? Doug Elliot : Ryan, we do feel very good about our balance sheet. And we felt, as we closed 2016, we took the actions that were appropriate, given everything we saw on all of our lines, including commercial auto. Again, one of the biggest challenges in every year as you start out is to anticipate loss trend, and I understand what you think your pricing will be. And so I think about our 2017 accident year. We just tweaked auto a little bit in our national casualty excess book and also in Small Commercial. But I think not far from where we were. And as you know, in our Small Commercial space, auto was our smallest line. It\u2019s essentially 10% of the book, so I just want to get that back closer to where it should be on profitability. But it\u2019s not causing major moments to step back and think otherwise. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And I didn\u2019t want to read too much into this, but I did see that policy count retention in Small Commercial dipped a little bit this quarter. And I was just curious what was driving that? Doug Elliot : Ryan, what market did you? Ryan Tunis : Small Commercial, the policy count number? Doug Elliot : Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything major there. We\u2019re competing well. We had a good new business quarter. Again, we\u2019re working price in our small segment not only in auto, but other lines. Competitive worker\u2019s comp space, but nothing that is out of the ordinary. Ryan Tunis : Okay. Christopher Swift : Yes, Ryan, I would just say, again statistically, Doug is right, but the inference is, we\u2019ve been aggressive with commercial auto rate in middle and small and there might be a knock-on effect for other lines, as it relates to commercial auto. But Doug\u2019s larger point and maybe it was nuance. I mean, the marketplace in general, particularly in Middle is still highly competitive. So as Doug said, we try to anticipate and provided obviously some indicators of where we saw margins going. So halfway through the year, I feel like we made the right call six months ago as far as price pressure. If you think about long-term loss cost trends that you have to price for and reserve for or we are where we are. But equally, it\u2019s also in a pretty good shape too. You continue to grind out all the activities that you have available to you to manage margins. But the simple pressure of price in lost cost trends in Middle is not a surprising results, where margins are going to be under pressure for the coming quarters. Ryan Tunis : Yes, that makes sense. And then I guess, just for Beth, from a capital return standpoint kind of looking forward. So I guess, statutory net income has been pretty good so far this year. But on top of that, I think, the pension deal, I think you has said that is going to be $300 million of year-end contributions. I mean, how should we think about, I guess, kind of the outlook for capital return as that sort of starts to take shape for 2018? Thanks. Beth Bombara : Yes. So, obviously, we\u2019re going to continue on our current path for this year as it relates to the capital actions that we have underway. The \u2013 I would not guide you to think that the pension contribution that we have would significantly alter sort of our plans as we think about capital actions in the future. And as we think about capital return from the operating subsidiaries, to the extent that operating income and it continues to perform well. We\u2019ll evaluate all that as we think about what capital we can take out of the subsidiaries next year. But very pleased that we\u2019re seeing improvement there. So if I look at P&C last year, we anticipated taking $800 million out in dividend this year. We\u2019re on track to take out $850 million and we\u2019ll evaluate next year based on our projections of what we think the capital return can be from there. Ryan Tunis : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. A few questions. First on auto. Just trying to tie together some of the comments. At the start of the Q&A, you mentioned that the goal there is 96.5 on an underlying basis. I know you guys said that you would get to around 100 to 102 this year. So I\u2019m just trying to think together how you see and I know that the year-end 2018 target. But how you see that level of improvement in 2018. I know there\u2019s still some level of rate, but it seems like you guys are also going to push on advertising side and potentially go after some new business, we\u2019re just trying to tie together those comments? Doug Elliot : Good question Elyse, no question that there are a series of compounding positive features that roll into the 2018 year and beyond. So the rate discussion that we\u2019ve had previously and also the underwriting initiatives will continue to earn their way through the second half of this year and then into 2018. So the 96.5 is the XX underlying, I still think it\u2019s achievable, we\u2019re working at it and I don\u2019t, at the moment, think that we\u2019re going to be putting on so much new business that will get in the way of achieving that target, so we\u2019re mindful of the target, our lean back into new business will be geographic driven, it will be territory where we have better rate adequacies and we feel better about our approach, so I would suggest you we\u2019re going to do it in a laser focused way that will not disrupt our path back to 96.5. Elyse Greenspan : Okay great, and then what are you guys seeing as loss cost in commercial lines kind of broadly? Doug Elliot : Generally speaking, they are low-to-mid single digits in the aggregate right, we look across our lines, worker\u2019s comp I described before, frequencies are flat to slightly down a little bit, severities depending upon medical or wage are single digits. There is a debate to be had about general liability because it takes a while to really understand what the accident year loss trends will be, but our view is that they are mid single digit-ish, properties got lower single digits attached, so in general we see a pretty stable loss cost environment, but also one that isn\u2019t stacked on zeros right and we think about the non-worker\u2019s comp. lines. We expect the other lines to have some degree of small loss cost inflation that we\u2019re trying to deal with in our pricing. Elyse Greenspan : Okay great, and then Beth, I know in the outlook for the year, you guys were looking for a little bit of a decline in your P&T investment income excluding limited partnerships, it\u2019s about flat through the six months, was there something inflating that number or maybe you guys coming in a little bit above your target for the year? Beth Bombara : Yes, so a couple of things. So, as we pointed out this quarter and the same with last quarter, we did have favorable partnership returns and in this situation both first quarter and second quarter, that was skewed a little bit more to property causality than to some of the other segments, so that\u2019s part of what was driving that. And then, we do continue to see some non routine income, we talked about this in the past, we don\u2019t budget for that, but as companies tend or debt and so forth sometime we get a little bit of a pickup there, but overall I would say the rate that we\u2019re \u2013 the yield that we are earnings is consistent with our outlook. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Dwelle : Good morning, just a small quick numbers kind of question. You commented that you do in your A&E reserve in the fourth quarter this year, how many dollars of reserves are still left that are sort of subject to that review, I would assume it\u2019s mostly E not A that\u2019s left to be reviewed? Beth Bombara : No, actually and we have extensive disclosure in our 10-Qs on the various balances related to A&E, but actually more of our reserves are A then E. And again as said, we will be looking to do that evaluation in the fourth quarter, but I\u2019ll just give you the page number, if you go to Page 100 \u2013 Page 84 in our 10-Q, you can see the breakout of both Asbestos and Environmental Reserves and at the end of June on a net basis asbestos was $1.288 million and environmental was $259 million. Mark Dwelle : Okay, thank you, that\u2019s all. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Please go ahead. Ian Gutterman : Great thank you. Doug, I first wanted to follow-up on Lisa\u2019s question there on the auto target for next year. Is it reasonable to assume that on a written basis that based on what you\u2019ve put through so far and assuming no change in the loss trends you see in the first half of the year that you shouldn\u2019t have much trouble getting to that 96.5 on our earned or is this still pricing you need to get from here or something else you need to execute from here to get there? Doug Elliot : You act like it\u2019s so easy to get there, Ian, right? It\u2019s still. Ian Gutterman : I said, if \u2013 actually, if loss trends are stable, I\u2019m taking that one out of the equation for you. Doug Elliot : All right. So that\u2019s a good one to take out, right? So we are obviously assuming a baseline of loss trends. Secondly, much of the activity, the hard work has already happened, right? So we\u2019ve got to earn in the written activity that we now are sharing with you, you can see it through the second quarter. And obviously, there\u2019s still a lot of work state by state to make happen. We\u2019ve got rate change activity in the third quarter and fourth quarter. But when we see through the plan, we\u2019re executing as we expected to, this goes back nine months ago when we built that plan. And if things continue to execute like we think they will, that chart \u2013 that target is very achievable. But I wouldn\u2019t say without sweat, right? We\u2019re working our tails off to get 96.5, I feel good about that, but if this were a baseball game, we\u2019re not bringing the relievers in yet, right? This is still in the middle of the game. Ian Gutterman : I understand \u2013 understood. And again just given the impact of written versus earned, I assume that would suggest there should be some further improvement into 2019 even if I won\u2019t ask for a number? Doug Elliot : Yes. Let\u2019s not ask for a number in 2019, yet. Ian Gutterman : Okay. Doug Elliot : We will\u2026 Ian Gutterman : Directionally, yes, okay. Doug Elliot : Yes, it all depends on how quickly we get there and when we do arrive. I mean, our rate adequacies in our business plans are all built dynamically as the next 12 and 18 months kind of play out. So pleased with progress, another six months of progress would close up a very nice turn year for us in 2017, which we expect to happen, and then 2018 is a big year to move closer to the target. Ian Gutterman : Got it. And then, Beth, I saw in the slides on Talcott, there was mention of the surplus growing from favorable changes in admitted DTA, can you explain what that means and how much it was? Beth Bombara : Yes. So in the quarter, we benefited a little bit less than $50 million from being able to admit more DTA than we could in the previous quarter. It\u2019s really just based on math of just what the rules are relative to what year admitted tax asset can be. We do see that bounce around often and we like to point that out just, because as we\u2019ve talked about before. When we think about surplus generation in Talcott, movement of DTAs from admitted \u2013 from non-admitted to admitted, we don\u2019t really think of that as generating potential for future dividends. Ian Gutterman : Got it, got it. And then sort of semi-related on DTA Talcott. Obviously, the legislation that allows you to change the entities. Can you talk a little bit about how much impact that could have on DTA going forward? I assume that allows you to manage that better? Beth Bombara : So that\u2019s a pretty complicated question on me. And so it kind of would depend on, again, how one might use division. So I don\u2019t think I can really give you an easy answer that that would or wouldn\u2019t impact how we utilize DTAs. It\u2019s really going to be based on anything on taxes, it\u2019s going to be based on facts and circumstances. Ian Gutterman : Make sense. All right. Thank you. Christopher Swift : Thank you, Ian. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Heidi, and thank you all for joining us today and your interest in the Hartford. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow-up with Investor Relations team. Thank you for your interest, and we wish you all a good weekend. Goodbye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Hartford conference call regarding this morning's announcement of its acquisition and third quarter 2017 financial results. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Today's webcast will discuss our agreement announced this morning to acquire Aetna's U.S. Group Life and Disability business. In addition, we announced third quarter financial results this morning. We thought that combining these 2 announcements would benefit investors by providing you all with the most comprehensive update on The Hartford, including the expected future financial and strategic benefits of the acquisition; our full third quarter financial results, including catastrophe results; revisions to our subsidiary dividend and capital management plans; and an update on other market, competitive and financial trends that are important considerations for your investment in The Hartford.  Please note that there are 2 separate press releases, which we issued early this morning : one for the acquisition released jointly with Aetna; and one for financial results. In addition, there is one 8-K for the acquisition and one for earnings, including the investor financial supplement and our declaration of a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. Please note that we will file our third quarter 10-Q on Thursday afternoon, consistent with our normal schedule.  Finally, there are also 2 slide decks : one summarizing the acquisition; and one for financial results. We will not be using the slide decks for this webcast, but we may refer to them in Q&A in order to bring certain items or numbers to your attention.  Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will provide ample time for Q&A for both the acquisition and financial results. Just a few comments before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update information or forward-looking statements provided on this call.  Investors should also consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for at least 1 year.  I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Swift : Thank you, Sabra. We appreciate everyone joining us this Monday morning. I'm very excited about today's announcement of our acquisition of Aetna's group benefits business. Group Benefits is a core underwriting business for us, with a stable risk profile, strong returns and good growth opportunities. Combined, we will have about $5 billion in annual premium, making us one of the top 2 companies in the market. We are pleased about the opportunity to deploy capital in a business that we know well and can efficiently integrate and grow. We thoroughly understand the fundamentals of this business, the customer expectations and distribution channel dynamics. Together, the strategic and financial benefits of this acquisition will create long-term shareholder value and strengthen our leadership in Group Benefits and P&C.  The combination of these businesses is compelling. Combining our 2 organizations, which together insure about 20 million individuals, is a unique opportunity to accelerate The Hartford's strategic objectives for Group Benefits, namely growing our voluntary product premium base and increasing our presence in the Middle Market segment. This deal positions us to achieve these goals. It also achieves our customer digital enablement objectives and provides a superior claims leave management platform that we will be able to leverage to achieve better claim outcomes. Additionally, we will be able to leverage our data and analytical capabilities across our workers' compensation and group disability claims, which will enhance our competitive advantages and cross-product capabilities.  Financially, it is accretive to core earnings and, in 2018, is accretive by more than $100 million before amortization of intangibles. The acquisition also provides a long-term return on investment in the double-digit range. Once we have completed the integration and achieved expense savings, we expect to generate incremental core earnings, before amortization of intangibles, of approximately $150 million annually by year 3 on a run rate basis. Beth will provide a deeper review of the financials, but I would highlight that we do anticipate meaningful expense savings. In total, we anticipate $100 million run rate savings that will build over 3 years. That estimate is focused on the integration of the 2 operations in the near term and not what we aspire to achieve longer term as we leverage the power of technology, digital capabilities and data and analytics. I would also note that the book is profitable today. It does not require fixing or underwriting initiatives. As a result, it will contribute to our bottom line in the first full year.  It's also important to note that the financial assumptions around this transaction have been prudently established and are realistic to achieve. In addition, we expect tax benefits from the transaction of about $325 million on a net present value basis. Finally, I am confident in the -- that the integration will go smoothly and efficiently, both from a people perspective and developing the future operating model as well as with our relationships with distributors, employers and individual customers. The Hartford and Aetna have complementary cultures providing high-quality products and excellent customer service to distributors and policyholders alike. Turning to the quarter, let me provide you with a brief overview of our third quarter results, which Doug and Beth will cover in more detail. The significant level of losses related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which were consistent with the range we preannounced, were the primary driver of our decline in core earnings. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those impacted by these storms as well as by the recent California wildfires. The Hartford's employees have worked tirelessly to help our customers recover from the devastation caused by these events. We're about restoring lives when customers have had their worst possible day. And I'm proud, but not surprised, at the phenomenal job our claim team has done.  Aside from the CAT losses, this quarter results were strong, and, at each segment, were either in line or better than our outlook. Underlying Commercial Lines' results were consistent with our expectations, with some pressure on margins from the competitive environment and loss cost trends. Personal Lines' underlying results continue to improve, reflecting our multiple profitability initiatives for personal auto. We expect continued Personal Lines' improvement in 2018. Group Benefits' results have been exceptionally good this year, continuing an overall trend of growth and margin improvements.  In addition, Mutual Funds has been delivering strong sales, good investment performance and overall positive net flows.  Finally, continued strong limited partnership returns have supported net investment income across all segments.  In summary, I'm very excited about today's acquisition announcement and the future potential in Group Benefits, and I'm equally pleased with our underlying financial results, both this quarter and for the year. Aside from catastrophe losses, our 2017 results will show a solid improvement from 2016. Looking forward, we are optimistic about continued growth and profitability in 2018 through additional progress in Personal Lines, the financial and strategic benefits of the acquisition of Group Benefits and the potential for an improved rate environment in Commercial Lines, particularly in property, as the industry comes to terms with pricing, risk selection and catastrophe exposures. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Elliott : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I provide an overview of our third quarter results, I'd also like to comment on our acquisition of Aetna's Group Life and Disability business. We are very excited about the potential of our complementary organizations. I've been impressed with the Aetna leaders we've met and the products, services and technology they have developed. This is an opportunity to create a more distinctive value proposition for our customers and distribution partners, and I look forward to working with our new combined team.  Turning back to third quarter performance. Of course, the most significant driver of our overall results was catastrophe losses of $352 million, primarily from Harvey and Irma. These storms, along with Maria, Nate and the California wildfires, have had devastating consequences for thousands of Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of them. For our claims team, it has been 8 weeks of nonstop action across the country in response to these disasters. Almost a year ago, many of you joined us at our Investor Day, where we highlighted our claim capabilities, including our mobile response unit. The performance of our team has been outstanding, moving as rapidly as circumstances on the ground will allow to meet with customers and help them begin the journey of rebuilding their homes, businesses and lives.  Neither Harvey nor Irma resulted in losses that exceeded our property CAT retention. We are pleased with the risk aggregation procedures and desk underwriting execution of our team in effectively managing our exposure to events such as Harvey, Irma and Maria. There is always room for refinement, and I'm sure we'll do some of that, but overall, I'm pleased with our performance.  Let me get into the details of our third quarter earnings, where we are very pleased with our underlying results across Property & Casualty and Group Benefits.  The Commercial Lines' combined ratio was 108.6, deteriorating 14.7 points versus prior year, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 93.2, deteriorating 3.2 points versus prior year, largely driven by increased expenses, primarily higher variable compensation and technology costs. There was also a modest margin compression in workers' compensation and general liability as market conditions continued to be competitive.  Small Commercial continued its strong performance with an underlying combined ratio of 89.2. Written premium was up 4.5% as retention remained very solid. New business of $140 million was down slightly from prior year. Over the last 4 quarters, our Small Commercial business has generated $586 million in new business, including Maxum, demonstrating the strength of our capabilities in a competitive market. In Middle Market, the underlying combined ratio was 97, deteriorating 3.9 points from 2016, primarily due to higher expenses and slight margin compression. Written premium decreased 1%. Solid retention, slightly positive renewal written pricing and new business production of $112 million, up from a year ago, was offset by lower auto premiums and other onetime premium adjustments. The market continues to be very competitive, and we're balancing growth aspirations with the need to maintain adequate pricing and sound underwriting quality standards.  Moving to Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.6 deteriorated 4.9 points, mainly due to higher expenses and a slightly higher auto liability loss ratio, as we have reported throughout 2017. Financial Products and Bond continued to contribute to the strong results in Specialty. In Personal Lines, the third quarter combined ratio was 104, deteriorating 3.8 points from a year ago. Catastrophe losses were up 5.1 points, offset by improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 94.9 improved 1.2 points. In auto, after adjusting third quarter 2016 for net development affecting the quarter, the 2017 auto loss ratio has improved approximately 2.5 points. Our progress remains in line with our expectations. The year-to-date auto combined ratio was 101.5, including 2.8 points of catastrophes. The full year auto combined ratio outlook of 101 to 103, which we provided at the start of 2017, included approximately 1 point for catastrophes. We expect to be above this range for the full year due to higher CAT losses. However, we remain on track to achieve 2 to 3 points of improvement in the underlying auto loss ratio for the full year. Personal Lines' written premium for third quarter 2017 was down 8%, largely driven by profit improvement initiatives and agency. Within the AARP Direct channel, written premium was down 3.5%. With improved rate adequacy, our increased marketing efforts are in full motion, and we expect to see positive year-over-year new business growth in early 2018.  Turning to Group Benefits, we posted another excellent quarter with core earnings of $66 million and a core earnings margin of 7.2%. Loss trends in 2017 continue to run better than expected, with improved group life results and favorable incidence and recovery trends in group disability. Our execution in underwriting, pricing and claims management as well as favorable market trends relative to historical experience are contributing 4.4 points of total loss ratio improvement for the quarter. On the top line, fully insured ongoing premiums for the third quarter increased 1%. Overall book persistency on our employer group block of business remains strong at approximately 90%. And fully insured ongoing sales were $68 million, up $7 million versus prior year. Group Benefits is on a very solid track and, with today's acquisition announcement, has an exciting future ahead. I look forward to updating you on this journey over the months to come.  In summary, our Property & Casualty and Group Benefit businesses delivered excellent underlying results for third quarter 2017. I'm extremely pleased with the consistent execution of our entire team and the performance of our businesses. We will continue to maintain our disciplined and balanced approach to deliver profitable growth, and we're especially proud of our colleagues on the frontline, who are responding to the needs of our customers faced with rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of catastrophic storms and wildfires. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to briefly cover third quarter results from the other segments and some of the key financial impacts of the acquisition of Aetna's Group Life and Disability business before taking your questions. Turning to Mutual Funds. Strong net flows and market appreciation as well as the addition of the Schroders funds drove total segment AUM up 18% to $111.7 billion and core earnings up 24% to $26 million. We continue to benefit from strong investment performance, with 79% of our funds beating their peers on a 5-year basis. Sales remain robust, helping generate net inflow of $3.4 billion in 2017 through September 30. Talcott's performance was in line with our outlook with core earnings of $83 million, down from $104 million in the third quarter of 2016 due to lower but still quite strong limited partnership income. Over the past 4 quarters, VA contract counts decreased 9% and fixed annuity contracts decreased 7%. Total statutory surplus was $4.1 billion at quarter-end, reflecting the impact of the $300 million in dividends paid in September. The investment portfolio continues to perform well, with generally stable portfolio yields, strong LP returns and modest impairments. Total LP investment income was $71 million before tax for an annualized yield of 12% compared with $93 million or 15% in the third quarter of 2016. Excluding LPs, the total before tax annualized portfolio yield was 4% this quarter, down slightly from the third quarter of 2016. For the P&C portfolio, the annualized yield, excluding LPs, was 3.7%, also down slightly from the third quarter of 2016.  To summarize, third quarter 2017 core earnings were $222 million or $0.60 per diluted share, down from third quarter 2016 due to the high level of catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  Our core earnings ROE for the past 12 months was 8.2%, up 0.6 points from a year ago, and our core earnings ROE, excluding Talcott, was 9.7%. Group Benefits' core earnings ROE was 12.1%, while P&C core earnings ROE was 10.7%, a good result in light of elevated catastrophe losses. Through the third quarter, we have reported $657 million of current accident year catastrophes. As we head into the fourth quarter, I would note that in addition to our per occurrence property CAT treaty, we have a property catastrophe aggregate treaty that provides coverage of up to $200 million above the attachment point of $850 million of aggregate CAT losses.  Turning to shareholders' equity. Book value per diluted share was $47.33, down 2% from a year ago, largely due to a reduction in AOCI. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share was $45.72, essentially the same as September 30, 2016. The year-over-year comparison on an ex AOCI basis was impacted by the fourth quarter 2016 charge related to our agreement to reinsure our A&E exposures, higher catastrophe losses and the second quarter 2017 charge related to the settlement of a portion of our pension obligation.  During the third quarter, we repurchased $325 million of stock. And through October 12, we repurchased an additional 900,000 shares for $52 million.  Before taking questions, I wanted to provide an overview of the financial and capital impact of the purchase of Aetna's Group Life and Disability business. We are paying $1.45 billion cash consideration, which is principally comprised of a ceding commission, in exchange for reinsuring to Hartford Life and Accident, our Group Benefits insurance subsidiary. The acquired business has approximately $2 billion of group disability and life premium, along with GAAP reserves of approximately $3.3 billion and invested assets with a fair value of approximately $3.4 billion. The purchase price is tax-deductible over time. And together with the impact the transaction will have on the timing of the utilization of our current tax attributes, we estimate the federal tax benefit to be approximately $325 million on a present value basis. The cash consideration will be funded through existing capital resources, including increased P&C and Talcott dividends in the fourth quarter. The purchase price does not include statutory capital to support the business, which will be provided by existing resources within Hartford Life and Accident as well as a $200 million capital contribution from the holding company. As a result of the transaction, the estimated company action level risk-based capital at Hartford Life and Accident will decrease to about 330% at year-end 2017, and we expect it to increase in 2018 to about 380% due to forecasted statutory net income. In addition, we do not expect dividends from Hartford Life and Accident through 2018.  We will not issue debt or equity to fund the cash consideration for the deal, and there is no financing contingency. We will fund the cash consideration and $200 million capital contribution from existing corporate resources, including dividends of $600 million from P&C, dividends of $800 million from Talcott and $250 million of existing holding company resources. Both the P&C and Talcott dividends are extraordinary and required regulatory approval, which we received last week.  Additionally, we have discontinued equity repurchases under our current program, which has $273 million left under the authorization. Given the additional dividends from P&C and Talcott this year to fund the transaction, 2018 subsidiary dividends will be significantly below prior years, and we do not currently expect to authorize a 2018 repurchase plan. However, based on the growing profitability of our P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses, we have declared an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. This is the fifth consecutive year we have increased our quarterly dividend. As previously communicated, we also plan to call our $500 million junior subordinated bond when it becomes redeemable at par in June 2018. As the acquisition is expected to close in early November, and based on our current outlook for persistency and earnings margins of the Aetna business, we expect the transaction to be accretive to net income and core earnings beginning in 2018. Net income accretion is estimated at $60 million to $80 million, including the impact of about $15 million after-tax of restructuring and integration costs not included in core earnings. Over the integration period, we expect restructuring and integration costs to total $50 million after-tax. By the completion of the integration, we expect to decrease annual run rate operating expenses by about $100 million before tax, $60 million of which we expect to achieve in 2018. We expect core earnings accretion to be in a range of $80 million to $100 million in 2018. This includes the expense savings as well as about $20 million to $30 million after-tax of amortization of intangibles.  From a balance sheet perspective, about half of the purchase price assigned to intangibles is classified as value of business acquired, which will be amortized through earnings over approximately 15 years. The remainder is classified as goodwill and does not amortize. As a result, there is no impact to book value per share, but a reduction in tangible book value per share of about 8% on a pro forma basis as of September 30. To conclude, aside from the impact of catastrophes, this quarter's results were consistent with our expectations for 2017, and demonstrate continued growth and strong margins in Group Benefits and Mutual Funds and ongoing improvement in Personal Lines' profitability as well as industry-leading Commercial Lines' performance. As Chris and Doug reviewed, we are excited about the opportunity to acquire Aetna's Group Life and Disability business, and are focused on a smooth and timely integration of the 2 companies' operations. I will now turn the call over to Sabra, so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Before beginning Q&A, I would like to remind you that since this call is public, it would be helpful to everyone listening live or reading the transcript if we are able to address as many of your material questions as possible, as we do not expect to have any public investor conferences or webcasts until early December at the Goldman Sachs conference. After this call, the investor relations team would be happy to explain any financial disclosures or technical tax or accounting questions that can be addressed with the information provided in our news release, IFS or slide deck. We appreciate your consideration of this request. Emily, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : A couple of quick questions here. Just first question, aside from, obviously, the reduction in statutory surplus you'll have at the Talcott entities, does this transaction with Aetna have any impact or implications on your ability to ultimately dispose of that? Christopher Swift : Brian, it's Chris. I didn't hear the last part. Dispose of? Brian Meredith : Of the remaining kind of the variable annuity and the fixed annuity institutional block in your run-off business, any implications that it will have? Christopher Swift : None. Brian Meredith : Got you. That's what I figured. Second question is could you talk a little bit more about what happened with the underlying kind of combined ratio in Commercial, particularly the expense side? Are these one-off type costs with the technology and variable comp? Or is this something we should kind of expect here going forward? Douglas Elliott : Brian, this is Doug. There were some one-offs in the quarter that were important. So 2/3 of that change, roughly, in the quarter related to expense. We had a little bit of amortization, depreciation of IT and then, also, we did some true-up of our variable comp plans. And I would note that there was a little bit of a swing in the quarter because last year, during third quarter, the adjustments went the other way. So this year, when we bumped up the accruals, we had a bit of a swing, and I would look toward the year-to-date to get a more normalized view. Relative to the loss margin compression, just a bit across our market in comp and GL, but nothing that I'm concerned with, and I think it's more the normal that we've been talking to the last couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : First question, could you discuss the strategic direction for the company? Because since the financial crisis, you've been downsizing your life business to focus on P&C. And now, you almost double your group life business. I just wonder, what do you think about the pro and the cons as a multi-line carrier versus a pure-play P&C carrier in the current marketplace? Christopher Swift : Kai, it's Chris. I'd recharacterize your statement a little bit. It's life and disability, in which we'd say disability is very similar to our P&C business. We see the linkage in alignment, particularly on adjudicating claims in comp and long-term disability, very similar. So I don't think we're trying to recreate a multi-line. We're focused on our 3 businesses, as we've said, since our restructuring, P&C Commercial, P&C Personal Lines, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds. So -- and we're going to continue to try to grow all 3. Our historic focus has been on organic growth, building capabilities, adding product lines. This is the first opportunity we had that made financial and strategic sense to acquire a business that we considered core all along. Kai Pan : Okay. So my second question on pricing, and one of your competitor last week pushing for sort of a more cross-based, like, pricing increase. What's sort of your pricing outlook? How do you position yourselves? Douglas Elliott : Kai, this is Doug. Let me address different parts of that question. I'll end up with property, which is on everybody's mind. Obviously, you know we've been working the auto pricing component hard these last several years, not just in Personal Lines, but also in Commercial. That work will continue, as evidenced by some of the disclosures we made in the supplement. Also, I've mentioned in prior calls that we have turned our attention up quite a bit in the general liability space. We've been concerned with a couple of trends inside particular sectors of our Middle Market and Small Commercial book, and have been addressing those with pricing the last couple of quarters. But there's no question the last 60 days of catastrophic events, flood, winds, wildfire, et cetera, make us go back and think about all of our property pricing. We've been working on our by-peril and geographic pricing elements the last 2 to 3 years, feel good about that progress. But obviously, the severity and the frequency of what we've seen in the last 60 days makes us go back and think even harder about property, and I expect our property prices will go up in the ensuing months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : I wanted to talk a little about where you are in terms of goals and margins on the group block you guys currently have, and where would you think that you would get to a targeted sort of steady-state on the new combined businesses. Christopher Swift : Yes. Josh, thank you. I would share with you, as we said in our prepared remarks, we're most pleased with our book of benefits and how it's performed on a year-to-date basis. And the margins have been healthy. We've always talked about 5.5% to 6% as sort of a normalized range. I don't see any update to that right now for our book. So when we combine it with Aetna, it will probably take a good 24 to 34 months to get to that 5.5% to 6% on a combined basis. But we're focused on integration, focused on the appropriate structure. But I have no reason not to believe that 5.5% to 6% on a combined basis should be the target for the entire portfolio. Joshua Shanker : And do you expect the group disability market to look notably different in 5 or 10 years in terms of consolidation following this transaction? Or in general, do you have a long-term view on the shape of it? Christopher Swift : Yes. I'd say, first, from, I'll call it, the product set and the needs, we're very bullish on it, right. We continue to believe benefits, including our voluntary and additional A&H capabilities, will have a place in the marketplace. We see long-term, steady, stable economic conditions, employment, so I don't see any shocks on the horizon. So it's hard to say what happens from a consolidation side, and I would say that the industry is already fairly tight around the top 10, probably controlling 10% or 80% of the premium. So I don't see any per se radical consolidation. But our aim, obviously, with this transaction is to be one of the top industry players that will continue to improve our offerings, our skill sets, our digital capabilities and really build a best-in-class platform to serve the benefits marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : I was just hoping maybe you guys could give us some idea of what the earnings are of -- from the Aetna transaction like in a baseline year, sort of if we're just thinking about what the company's earning in -- or what that unit's earning in 2017 without thinking about any of the cost saves. Christopher Swift : Ryan, obviously, we don't have Aetna's forecasted 2017 earnings for the division. I think what we are trying to do to help you is we tried to provide a core earnings number with and without amortization of intangibles in '18. And I tried to lead you to think that 3 years henceforth, on a run rate basis, we're about $150 million of after-tax earnings, ex intangible amortization. So those are the points I would triangulate for your model. Ryan Tunis : Got you. And I guess, for those cost saves, is there going to be reinvestment of any of that? Or are you thinking about, I guess, all of that flowing to the bottom line in getting to the $150 million? Christopher Swift : Well, I think most of it. We think for the bottom line, I think one of the real features that we're, Doug and I and Mike Concannon, who's with us here, our business leader, is they really do have some good digital capabilities, particularly embedded in their claims system and their recovery management capabilities. So that is actually a big cost avoidance for us to spend upwards of $100-plus million to build a more modern claim platform for this business. So that's a great benefit, but it will probably take 12 to 18 months to fully integrate into our platforms. So otherwise, what I would say, it's a typical back-office consolidation of activities. I think our vision is to really create an integrated leadership team here because the Aetna men and women run a good business, have proven their capabilities in this space as a good competitor. So we want to leverage as much of that talent as possible within our organization going forward. Ryan Tunis : That's helpful. And then, I guess just a point of clarification. It's kind of difficult looking at the legacy, I guess, the way Aetna presented it, to really tell what's been going on, but it does look like profitability of the group business in general has gotten a little bit worse, which is -- it seems like we've seen the opposite on Hartford's block. First of all, is that a fair assessment in terms of what you're looking at? And second of all, I guess, if it is, can you talk a little bit about what you think's been driving performance there over the past few years, and how you think you might be able to reverse that or improve it? Christopher Swift : It's probably not fair to comment on their trends. I mean, obviously, it's their trends. I could tell you, what we did from a diligence side is look at the block in totality. I think we were very comfortable with the pricing assumptions, the reserving assumptions. We'll have to harmonize into our environment as far as discount rates and the like. But I tried to say in my commentary, Josh, that I didn't see -- excuse me, Ryan, I didn't see the need to view this as a fixer-upper. I mean, I think the block is performing fairly well, and we'll integrate it, and as business comes up for renewal at a regained rate guarantee, compete effectively to retain that business going forward. That's probably the highest priority of the integration. And Doug and I talk about it with Mike and the leadership team, is we have to have a high retention of customers coming out of rate guarantees. Douglas Elliott : Ryan, one other thing, this is Doug, that Chris and I and Mike have spent a lot of time talking about, we are strong in the national account space and actually across the board. There's an exhibit in the prepared PowerPoint slides that gives you a sense of their mix. We're excited. Yes, they have a strong national franchise, but they also have a very solid middle market franchise that when combined with ours, really enables us to be a different player in the Middle Market. So excited about their digital capabilities, excited about their absence management system and very excited that we're going to be leaning into the middle market in addition to all of our voluntary suite of products that we will bring to market and have been over the past couple of quarters. Ryan Tunis : That's helpful. And then, I guess, just lastly and maybe for Beth. Just thinking about how big is Group Benefits now as a percentage of total allocated equity at the company. I mean, I guess, obviously, it seems like doing the coinsurance deal, you'll have to -- I think you're committing $200 million of statutory equity. But do you have any idea, I guess, pro forma this transaction, what percentage of your allocated GAAP capital will be supporting Group Benefits? Beth Bombara : Yes. And actually included in our materials, we showed some of the balance sheet impacts relative to Group Benefits. But when you look at kind of all-in equity, and I'm looking at more on a GAAP basis, Group Benefits pro forma for this transaction will be about 17%. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Two questions. I guess, the first one on the Aetna deal. From what I understand, this one has been floating out there for about a year. So obviously, others had a chance to look at this. Is there something that makes you kind of the better buyer for this business versus others out there? Christopher Swift : Jay, I would say we're very complementary besides being a half a mile apart. I mean, their business profile and ours equally weighted life and disability, good national account presence, good middle market presence. I think our voluntary suite of products we've built out over the last 3 or 4 years and is really coming from a sales and revenue side. So I think the natural synergies -- as I said, their claim system and some of their digital capabilities, we think are best-in-class. And how we integrate it and use that insight, particularly as it relates to workers' comp and share the benefits across multiple product lines, I think it makes us the natural buyer. There are more synergies. And I know we've discussed this in the past, Jay, but disability and comp, there are more and more synergies all the time, whether it be from a distribution side, a claim outcomes side, a cross-sell opportunity side, it is really integrated these days. Jay Cohen : Got it. That's helpful. And then the second question is on the California fires. I know it's early, can you give us at least qualitatively what you're seeing out there as far as your exposure, personal versus commercial at this point? Beth Bombara : Sure, Jay. It's Beth. So a couple of things. It is early to provide an estimate where, obviously, our claims folks are working very closely and responding to our customers. What I would say is as we see here and look at it, we see the exposure could be at or above what we incurred for Harvey, which again, on a pretax basis, was $175 million. And we really see it primarily as a Personal Lines event with relatively small exposure on the Commercial side. Operator : Our next question comes the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : I have a few questions. First, can you guys -- can you tell us what equity Aetna had supporting their group benefits business? Christopher Swift : Elyse, I don't have that data. So the equity that Aetna had supporting it? Elyse Greenspan : Yes. Christopher Swift : Yes, that wouldn't be relevant for us. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question, on the auto side. In terms of the disclosures in the quarter, the expense ratio was relatively stable year-over-year. I know you guys alluded to potentially seeing the expense ratio rise as you kind of look to reinvigorate growth there. Is that something you're expecting in the fourth quarter? And then the rate increases got up to 12% this quarter. In your mind, does that -- is that as high as it's going to get? Just how do you kind of see rate as well as expenses in that business as we think about Q4 and onward? Douglas Elliott : Two good questions, Elyse. This is Doug. On the expense question, yes, we were about even for the quarter after a couple of quarters of outperforming 2016. In the fourth quarter, I expect it to swing the other way, so I think our expense numbers will be up a couple of points versus 2016. And that's -- as we lean into marketing, we'll be spending there. So that's the expense side. On the pricing side, I do think we are about at our high watermark for written pricing. So obviously, that written will earn its way in. But as we think about our curves, our filings, our needed rate, we are at a high watermark that will be tapering into 2018. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then one more question. In terms of the acquisition, Chris, I think in the past, you had mentioned maybe your sweet spot would be deals about $500 million to $1 billion in premiums. And maybe that was just kind of some commentary off the cuff in terms of potential acquisitions, I guess. This is obviously double that target. Is it just -- obviously, the strategic rationale that you mentioned earlier in the call. Is that what's your view, I guess, to pursue a deal that just in terms of that metric seems a bit bigger than what you had been looking for? Christopher Swift : Yes, I generally agree. I mean, it was an opportunity. Obviously, it's a little bigger. It's benefits. So a lot of that commentary we talked about on this acquisition side related to P&C in that $500 million to $1 billion, which would still be a sweet spot. This one was in the benefits space and just a little bit bigger, but very -- again, very financially and strategically compelling. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Thomas Gallagher : A couple of questions on the deal. Chris, if I'm understanding the math correctly, you're saying $150 million of annualized earnings power 3 years out, right? So -- and is the way to interpret that -- and part of that's going to come from the $100 million of expense saves. So the math I'm doing would suggest you're paying about 20x current run rate earnings, but then eventually, with the benefit of cost saves, you'd be paying 10x when you think about what you fully expect this to earn 3 years out. Is that a fair way to think about the multiples and evaluation here? Christopher Swift : I don't want to fact-check your math, but I think generally, the $150 million ex amortization of intangibles would be a key. Yes, and I thought about it more from an '18 side, forward '18 earnings with a little, like, expense servings. We're probably paying 16, 17x forward earnings. So I wouldn't quibble with your math too much. Thomas Gallagher : Okay. And then just related to the deal also, I think as I've looked at the block, it had some deterioration in group disability over the last few years from a loss ratio standpoint, and I know they lost a large national account business recently. To what extent have you factored those things in? Do you think there needs to be significant repricing? Or is there material integration risk as you think about the transaction? Christopher Swift : Tom, I tried to describe it as, it will require a lot of hard work, no doubt about it, but I think we see it as relatively smooth and straightforward. And from the block's performance in totality, I think we're comfortable where they priced it and where results have been. That's not to say that we're not going to tweak things as we go forward, but you should not think in terms of a fundamental repricing initiative, sort of a fixer-upper in my colloquial language. So I think we feel very comfortable that they've been prudent over the years, but we'll have to integrate it and run it through our pricing models long term. Thomas Gallagher : Got it. And then just one final one, the 330% RBC, is that a number that you expect to build back up? Or is that a good run rate? Can you talk about what your RBC target would be, where you want that to be sort of steady-state? Beth Bombara : Yes. Tom, it's Beth. So when we think about the RBC to support this business, we think about it long term in the 350% to 400% range. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, when we look out at the income we'll generate in '18 and don't anticipate dividends from Hartford Life and Accident in '18, we'll get back up into that range. We anticipate being at about 380%, and we feel very comfortable running that business at those levels. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Randy Binner : I want to go back to distribution, and this [ news ] has become a very large market to a number of distributors out there. And it's the question of 1 plus 1 equals what here? And I've heard answers that you're going to be better in the middle market, and that your digital services that you're getting from Aetna, I think are a material improvement. But can you just walk us through a little bit more how you've kind of overcome that typical issue you have from a distribution perspective when you become such a large market together for a lot of the folks who move this product? Christopher Swift : Yes. I'll start, and then I'll ask Doug to comment. I mean, that is traditional thinking. But I would say that this market is already highly concentrated. And I think the capabilities that our combined group have, particularly in disability and the insights and our proven track record of helping clients recover more quickly, just sort of speaks for itself from a capability side. I would say also, from the broker side, we have meaningful relationships with a lot of these men and women on the P&C side. And I think it's just an additional connection point, opportunity point, profit point for them as we can do more business together. So I don't see a 1 plus 1 equals anything less than 2 at this point in time, but we've got to work hard to earn their trust. And again, as I said, when business comes out of rate guarantees, to really work hard to retain those accounts and relationships. Doug, what would you add? Douglas Elliott : I guess, the only thing I would add is that as part of this relationship, we have entered a multiyear agreement with Aetna to work with their medical reps on selling business together, so they will have the ability to work with our folks. And this distribution agreement, multiyear, I think, is very exciting. They have done a nice job in the past at working together, both medical and their group business, and we look forward to seeing how we can win together going forward. So Chris, I'm excited. I think our reputation is well earned in the Group Benefits space amongst the top brokers. Yes, I think there's opportunity for us to be broader and deeper in the next 200 outside of that top 10, and I think this capability and group of talent executives coming over from Aetna allow us to jointly enter that space more aggressively. Beth Bombara : Another thing... Randy Binner : Just a quick follow -- sorry, go ahead. Sorry. Beth Bombara : No, Randy, the only thing I was going to add is that, obviously, as we assessed this business and as we built our projections over the next couple of years, we did take into consideration that, sometimes, you can have a little bit of, for lack of a better word, shock lapse that can enter the book. So we've taken that into consideration in building our projections. But as Doug and Chris said, we do believe that we're in a good position to compete in this space going forward. Christopher Swift : Randy, just one final point. I mean, with 20 million combined customers, again, I really think the opportunity here is voluntary products, to be able to offer, again, through our distribution partners, a full product suite of voluntary capabilities and maybe additional A&H capabilities down the road that, again, I think will be attractive to our distribution partners going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Jamminder Bhullar : Some of my questions were answered, but can you discuss what do you view your capacity, your appetite for buybacks beyond 2018? I think -- like would you anticipate returning to the market in 2019? Christopher Swift : Jimmy, it's Chris. I'd say -- I mean, you know our historical pattern. We'd like to obviously close this transaction, integrate it, get a good way through '18, see how we're performing, but the capital generation of the firm is still strong. So as we get into '19, there are possibilities of returning additional capital to shareholders, but that would be premature to really speculate and forecast right now, and we'll keep you posted as we go along. Jamminder Bhullar : Okay. And then on the loss ratio in the Personal Lines business, it's inched higher in the past couple of quarters, I guess, and mostly because of the auto business. I guess, some of that could be seasonality, but could you discuss what's driving that despite the fact that you've been implementing price hikes as well? Douglas Elliott : Yes. Jimmy, this is Doug. It is all seasonality. Our underlying fundamentals are very solid, and we feel very good about the progress we've made, very much in line with our expectations and what we shared with you last January. Jamminder Bhullar : And then lastly, as you look at your Group Benefits franchise, do you feel like you're going to need to grow it? Like obviously, you've made a big bet on the Group Benefits market with this deal because it seems like you paid maybe a fair price, certainly not a very low price for this acquisition. You've also suspended buybacks and taken your business mix away from being more of a pure P&C company. So do you feel like, as you're looking at the Group Benefits business further, that you're going to continue to expand through acquisitions? Or what's your view of just how this business fits within your overall franchise, and whether you need to add additional capabilities in this market over time? Christopher Swift : Just to be clear, I think we have all the capabilities we need to compete here for the long term : full product set; core disability; core life; voluntary; A&H, particularly business travel accident coming online. So I don't see the need to go out and think in terms of what's the next deal that we're going to do in this space, Jimmy. It's really about execution. It's about managing our distribution relationships and ultimately, taking care of the customers that we have today. So that's our focus. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Mark Dwelle : It's a couple of questions related to the transaction and the guidance. Why was this structured as a reinsurance transaction? Was that -- is the tax benefits that you're going to be able to ultimately benefit from, was that really sort of the secret sauce that kind of make the math work on this? Christopher Swift : No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, remember, there's certain blocks of business that Aetna has in their legal entities that is not coming over, as we disclosed in our slide deck, principally, long-term care and dental and vision. So I don't -- they didn't offer us to sell us a legal entity, and I think it was structured vis-\u00e0-vis reinsurance to dispose of the business they wanted to sell us. Mark Dwelle : I see, okay. So that structure was really more motivated by their interests and motivations than necessarily The Hartford's? Christopher Swift : Yes. It was their legal structure. And I would say the tax benefits, there's ways of replicating an asset sale, vis-\u00e0-vis tax code election. So I don't want to get into a detailed tax debate, but there were tax benefits that we enjoyed during -- in this transaction. Mark Dwelle : Okay. The second question, there's sort of 2 sub-questions related to just the guidance figures, the core earnings after tax of $80 million to $100 million. Just to clarify, is that the core -- the earnings after tax as it relates to the Group Benefits portion, which is to say, does that number take into account the less investment income that you would have out of the P&C and Talcott as a result of the way the deal's funded? Beth Bombara : Yes. This is Beth. So the $80 million to $100 million is reflective of the increase we see on the Group Benefits side. Again, from a timing perspective, yes, the net investment income in P&C and Talcott would be slightly impacted by the acceleration of the dividends that we're taking out, but really not a very meaningful amount. Mark Dwelle : Okay. And then in that same vein, the tax benefits that The Hartford overall will realize, are those taken into account within the $80 million to $100 million? Or would that be kind of over top of that spread across the group? Beth Bombara : Yes. So that gets a little complicated. Again, when we think about the tax benefit, we really think about that from a cash flow perspective. How it will impact the P&L, again, since a lot of the tax benefit is coming from the purchase price and the intangibles that are going to be amortized into income, there's a piece of it that would come through the tax benefit associated with the amortization on the intangibles, and there's a portion of it that relates to goodwill, which obviously stays on the balance sheet. So the way I think about it is it really is more of a cash flow item that will impact the statutory capital of the subsidiaries, which ultimately, will provide capital to the holding company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Heagerty with Atlantic Equities. John Heagerty : Just a couple of points of clarification, if I could. On the $150 million, is that -- is there any sort of revenue synergies included in that? Is that all expected to be expense synergies coming through? Christopher Swift : What I would say is that we have a revenue model. I wouldn't say that it is, I'll call it, aggressive in terms of what we think we could do from a revenue growth side. I think it's somewhat, we think, what we can do with our business. And as Beth pointed out to, we've been a little cautious in forecasting just what is the lapse rate renewal and retention going forward. So we've probably been a little conservative there, John. So I wouldn't say that there is a lot of revenue synergies other than I do think we could increase our run rate sales in voluntary with this larger customer base. John Heagerty : And then just on the timing of the integration costs, can you tell us when they're going to be -- which year they're going to be phased in and how much in each year? Beth Bombara : Yes. So John, we've actually included that in some of the slide materials that are on our website. But as we said, we expect about $15 million after-tax to come in, in 2018. There'll be a little bit that will come through in 2017, and then the remainder we'll see in 2019. But if you go to Page 14 in our slide deck, we give you the run rate of those costs over the period. John Heagerty : Great. And then finally, just more philosophically, how do you sort of evaluate making this acquisition from a shareholder value-creation perspective just compared to simply buying back more stock? Christopher Swift : John, we've talked about this extensively. I mean, we are very sensitive to, I'll call it, the metrics of -- the short-term metrics of buying back shares. But in this particular one, we thought in terms of the long-term IRRs, which is more attractive than buying in shares today. Yes, I think we've been focused on a growth orientation that creates new revenue streams, whether we build them or acquire them. And we balance that, I think, pretty well here with a return on investment that will approach double digits. And that's what we wanted to focus on, is having the recurring revenue and earnings stream in our profile going forward than just the short-term benefits of share buybacks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Firstly, can I go back to the tax? I guess, I'm struggling to understand what that $325 million is. Is that just like the Aetna NOL that you're able to keep on the acquisition? Or is there something that has to do with how you use your own tax benefits stash? Or what exactly is that? Beth Bombara : Right. So there's 2 pieces. The bulk of it relates to the fact that the amount that we're paying, the $1.45 billion, nearly all of that is tax-deductible over time. So we will amortize that, get a tax deduction. Typically, on average, it's around 15 years. And so that's what we did as we looked at that tax benefit impacting us over that period of time and what that value is on a present value basis. And that's probably about $260 million of the amount that we discussed. The other portion is the fact that with the increase in earnings that we will have coming from this acquisition, we will be able to utilize our current tax attributes, our NOLs and AMT credits, faster than we otherwise would have. And so, again, PV-ing out the cash flows associated with that is where we get the remainder of the benefit. Ian Gutterman : Okay, that makes sense. So is it fair to think of the consideration paid is really closer to $1.1 billion? Beth Bombara : Yes. I would. The way we think about it is the amount that we paid less the present value benefit that we'll get from these tax attributes over time. Ian Gutterman : Got it, okay. And then, Doug, I want to go back to Josh's question about just if I think 2, 3 years out, once you've had a chance to reprice the book, is there any reason this shouldn't -- is there something fundamentally different about where they play or their mix of business that it shouldn't be in that 5.5% to 6% range on profitability? Douglas Elliott : Ian, I don't think so. I think we know them as a competitor. We've done our diligence. We expect coming together the fundamentals of how we compete in the marketplace to be consistent with our prior approach. And those goals that Chris outlined are absolutely doable, and we expect to achieve them. Ian Gutterman : Okay. So a leading question here, but if I take the $100 million of savings, so after-tax $65 million, on a pro forma, $5-plus billion on a premium base, that's an extra point to margins. Does that suggest the goal over time can become 6.5% to 7%? Christopher Swift : Ian, you're really stretching us here. Again, all I would share with you right now is there are potential upsides, but I'd rather have you focus on what is ultimately realistic, and what we've talked about is realistic. And if there's upside, we'll talk about it. You'll see it coming through the top line in cross-sell opportunities, however you want to describe it. But let's just focus on what's realistic as opposed to anything that really pushes the bounds. Ian Gutterman : No, that's right. I just want to -- I was sort of trying to reverse-engineer your $150 million you commented on earlier. If I take out the $65 million after-tax of savings, that's $85 million. On $2 billion, it's only 4%. So I just want to make sure that, that -- it sounds like you should, hopefully, be able to do better than that $150 million as that 4% goes up to 5% or 6%. Christopher Swift : From your mouth to God's ears. Ian Gutterman : Yes, okay. And then just quickly, any -- I know you commented on it a little bit, but any further detail you want to add to -- obviously, there's been a lot of speculation from some of the earlier calls. I'm guessing you've heard about pricing opportunities. And one of your large competitors talked about pricing outside not being driven just by what they're seeing in CAT, but just based on the pressures, Doug, I think you've talked about before, about some of the pricings not really being attractive on a return basis. Does it feel like there's opportunities beyond just property that you can get rate on package, if you will, which implies you're getting rate on comp, too? Or is it really going to be more narrow, I guess? Douglas Elliott : I guess, I'll take that apart in a few different ways. Clearly, we've been working on the package area ex -- we'll come back to comp because I would separate liability, GL from workers' compensation. And we have been addressing our needs in the general liability area over the last couple of years, and you see that in the fact that we're pleased with our pricing performance in the quarter. But I do think there is potential for us to lean into both our liability and our property pricing a little harder over the coming months. And clearly, the events the last 60 days give us reason to go back and reassess our CAT loads and our tornado hail loads, et cetera, in our property book. Workers' compensation is a little bit different story. So we are managing our way through a bit more of a regulated climate in Commercial Lines. We really are very pleased about our current book performance and are trying to balance that book performance with pricing trends as we go forward. So Ian, I think we'll continue to manage comps separately, but yes, I see some upside in the pricing in our property and GL area. Sabra Purtill : Thanks. Emily, I believe we have one more question in the queue. But if there's anybody else who wants to ask a question, please queue into the call. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : I just have one last follow-up. So if we were to have any sales from here of noncore assets, just curious how we should think about the prioritization of the use of proceeds. Should we think about capital first being used to get the capital levels higher in HLA, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Should we think about buyback next, and then M&A? Or does that not sound like, kind of, the right way to think about it? Christopher Swift : Ryan, it's Chris. We've talked about this before. I think if -- through any additional sales of noncore assets, we would first look to always right size our debt and equity ratios as we would monetize a unit. I think from there, we've always talked about wanting to deploy capital into growth opportunities, whether it be organic or, obviously, M&A, like we did here today. And then finally, if there aren't, I'll call it, adequate uses for that capital, that earn a hurdle rate of above our cost of equity capital, we would consider returning excess capital over time to shareholders, but we demonstrated the priorities of using excess capital here in recurring revenue streams, and I would have that mindset going forward. Beth Bombara : And, Ryan, the only thing I'll add to that, again, as we look at the capitalization of HLA, we're very comfortable with the level that it's at. And the fact that just through the normal course of the earnings generation that will be there next year, that will be within our RBC targets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer Shields : Okay. One question on operations and one on the deal. Doug, you talked about a true-up for variable comp affecting the expense ratio this quarter. I was hoping you could dig a little deeper in terms of what underpinned that decision. Beth Bombara : Yes. Meyer, I'll take that. It's Beth. So -- and I think it's important to also point out the comment that Doug made on just the year-over-year compares. So when we look at our variable compensation plans, which are tied to what our underlying performance in our businesses are, if you look at 2016, obviously, our underlying performance was not where it needed to be, and we took down a lot of incentive accruals in the third and fourth quarter. When you look at our underlying performance for this year, we feel it has been very strong. And so we saw increases in that. So there's a little bit of a delta, and that last year we were taking things down. And this year, we were modestly increasing them. That shows up in the expense ratio. Meyer Shields : Okay. So this is -- the deal is being structured as reinsurance. Is there going to be any need for a new corporate entity or something like that at Hartford? Or can all of this business be handled within your current core operating structure? Christopher Swift : No, it could be handled by HLA. HLA is the, again, the assuming companies, which is our entity devoted towards the Group Benefit business. If you recall, we restructured that years ago, and there's no additional legal entities required, Meyer. Meyer Shields : Okay, fantastic. And then just finally, the $325 million present value tax benefit, that's all 35%, right? Beth Bombara : Yes. So we did that based on current tax rates. I would point out that, obviously, if tax rates go down, that benefit would go down, but the value of the business and the earnings on that business, being taxed at a lower rate would far exceed any decrease to that value. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Jamminder Bhullar : Beth, I just wanted to follow up on the components of the tax benefit. And if I understood your comments right, I think the 2 components are, one, the purchase price being deductible and in the future; and then second is just the acceleration in the use of your existing tax attributes. And, I guess, I understand how the acceleration in the use of your existing tax attributes creates extra value because of this deal, but the purchase price being deductible, if you were to grow your business organically, most of those, sort of the consideration and expenses involved in that, would have been deductible anyway. So I'm just trying to understand how that is sort of extra value that's being created just through the deal. Beth Bombara : Well, based on the price that we're paying, the fact that it is deductible, over time, we will get a tax benefit associated with that. And we think that's an important consideration as you think about the total cash flows associated with acquiring this business today. Jamminder Bhullar : No, that I understand, but if you were -- it's not like if you were -- my point is, wouldn't -- and any time if you'd built the business organically, any consideration that you -- or the cash that you would have had to outlay because of -- for that would have been deductible anyway, right? It has nothing -- you're just pointing out like how cash flows will work in the future because you'll get a tax benefit. But most of the time, if you're building a business in-house versus doing any deals, that -- any cash that you have that's an outlay would be deductible anyway, right? Beth Bombara : That's true, and I think that would be an important consideration in looking at what you're -- what's being spent. But again, the fact that we are getting a tax benefit on what we're paying, when you think about the cash flows associated with the entire business, I still see it as a relevant point. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Emily, and thank you, all, for joining us today and your interest in The Hartford. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow up with the investor relations team. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Today's webcast will cover our 2017 financial results and 2018 outlook for selected business metrics. We announced our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results last night and the news release and investor financial supplement are available on our website. Please note that consistent with prior year-end periods, our 10-K will be filed at the end of the month, but we have included some additional data in the investor financial supplement that will be in the 10-K, such as the P&C loss reserve roll forward. Also please keep in mind that as a result of the agreement to sell Talcott Resolution, current and prior financial results for this former segment have been accounted for as discontinued operations, which is in our Corporate segment, as required under U.S. GAAP. This change does not change net income for prior periods, but it does reduce core earnings as income from discontinued operations is included -- is not included in our core earnings calculation. If you have any questions about this change, please consult the IFS and the 10-K when filed, but also feel free to give the Investor Relations team a call with any questions about the accounting. Our speakers today include Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara, CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will have time for Q&A.

Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. 2017 was an eventful year at The Hartford with several major accomplishments, including the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business and the agreement to sell Talcott Resolution. However, bottom line results were negatively impacted by the loss on sale of Talcott and the charge for U.S. tax reform. Core earnings were up 11%, and core earnings per diluted share were up 19% despite exceptionally heavy catastrophe losses in 2017. This is an outstanding result, reflecting the strength of the organization. Commercial Lines margins were strong, Personal auto profitability improved great, Group Benefits and Mutual Fund results were excellent, and we had very good investment returns across the board. Looking back over the year, I am truly pleased with our results and impressed with our team's ability to deliver on the numerous initiatives we have underway. In Personal Lines, I am very pleased with the strong improvement of our auto line, where the underlying combined ratio improved by 4.2 points. Improving auto profitability has been a top priority for our management team, and this is a significant milestone as we position the business to return to growth by leveraging the historical strengths of our AARP relationship. Overall, Personal Lines results were significantly affected by the major catastrophe events of 2017 with full-year CAT losses more than double our average annual expectations. In Commercial Lines, we began 2017 focused on maintaining our strong underlying margins as we correctly anticipated increasing competitive forces. Margins did remain strong, although we expected pressure in workers' compensation and general liability. However, as Doug will discuss more fully in his comments, we have some optimism that pricing environment may improve in 2018, and our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing will serve us very well as the market pivots. We also advanced a number of strategic initiatives in Commercial Lines that continue to strengthen our value proposition and extend our competitive advantages. For example, in Small Commercial, we continue to innovate with an ever-improving agent and customer experience. We have now integrated E&S product capabilities within our ICON quoting platform, becoming a one-stop provider to more customers, including an integrated billing option. We also started offering automatic quotes through ICON for Group Benefit products at point of sale, enabled by our advanced data and analytic capabilities. In Middle Market, our industry verticals are building momentum, led by outstanding teams of industry veterans who have joined The Hartford in recent years, excited to combine their underwriting and product expertise with our distribution and service excellence. In Group Benefits, we posted excellent financial results on both the top and bottom line. Our value proposition on service and claims management for life and disability, coupled with our voluntary product offerings, resonates very well with our customers, and we see the benefit of that in our retention. Lastly, we welcomed more than 1,800 new teammates from Aetna to our company, further strengthening our market-leading capabilities.  In Mutual Funds, we continued to grow core earnings, supported by sales and positive net flows from strong investment performance and expanded fund offerings. And last but not least, in December, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Talcott Resolution for a total value to shareholders of about $2.7 billion, with an expected closing date by June 30.  Across the enterprise, we are making investments necessary to compete in a digital world defined by customer experience. We are expanding our digital portals in Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits to give agents and customers greater access and flexibility in managing their coverage, billing and claims. We are deploying robotics in operations, allowing us, for example, to process e-mailed requests for certificates of insurance in minutes.  And we are especially committed to our data and analytics journey. We continue to invest heavily in the talent, technology and data that we believe is increasingly defining our business. This work is generating new insights on risk, underwriting and claims management, which in turn elevates our customer experience and improves our financial performance. The addition of the group benefits business from Aetna is additive to our efforts as we are now the No. 2 writer of both workers' compensation and group disability insurance, with unparalleled data sets across those businesses. This is exciting progress in our vision to become a broader and deeper risk player in the market, defined by a unique focus on agent and customer needs.  All of these 2017 successes are a part of a much broader plan to ensure that The Hartford is a contemporary company and prepared for a rapidly changing future, both financially and operationally.  Turning to tax reform. There are many positives and a few watch areas. Growth in investment should accelerate with the passage of tax reform while cash is repatriated from overseas. In the insurance sector, we are pleased that the playing field has been leveled to a certain degree.  On the other hand, there is uncertainty about how the lower tax rates play out over time and the extent to which the benefit will be competed away or be subject to regulatory rate reduction actions. For 2018, a good portion of the tax benefit will fall to the bottom line as most of the year's earned premiums were written in 2017. And many lines, including Personal and Commercial auto property and liability, still need additional rate to achieve our profitability goals. We will continue to work hard to achieve them.  We also intend to use a portion of the additional cash flow we expect from tax reform to accelerate execution on our existing technology initiatives. We begin 2018 with confidence in momentum in all our businesses, focused on our financial and strategic goals for each. With the economy expanding, we see plenty of opportunities for profitable growth. Based on the metrics we provided for 2018. we expect to generate higher earnings and a core ROE of between 11% and 12%, including the benefit of lower tax rates. We expect the improvement to come from additional margin in Personal Lines, continued strong margins in Commercial Lines and earnings growth in both Group Benefits and Mutual Funds.  However, we do not expect much of an impact this year from the sale of Talcott given the expected timing for closing the transaction. As we have shared with you before, the priority for our excess capital is to generate long-term sustainable growth, either organically or with acquisitions that make financial and strategic sense. We will also evaluate debt and equity capital management opportunities, being thoughtful and focused on creating sustainable shareholder and stakeholder value.  Finally, it's not just what we did in 2017 but how we did it. Our philosophy is simple : we believe that doing the right thing every day is core to our character. Customers, agents, employees know we are a brand they can trust, that we treat people with respect and we honor our commitments to them.  I am proud of the recognition we have received for this, including our third year of being in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, nine years of recognition by Ethisphere as one of the most ethical companies and numerous Best Place to Work awards from various groups. We also believe that we have an obligation to make a difference in the communities where we work and live. You can see this in our sustainability report we publish on our website. The Hartford supports many activities, including educating kids on fire prevention through our Junior Fire Marshal program, which celebrated its 71 anniversary this year. We're also a founding sponsor of the U.S. Paralympic team, which will be competing in South Korea in March. To conclude, 2017 was an outstanding year for The Hartford. While bottom financial results and book value were affected by some of our strategic decisions, I am very pleased with our underlying performance, the strength of our balance sheet and the value we provided to customers during a year of record catastrophes for the industry. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris. And good morning everyone. Looking back on our business objectives for 2017 and the results achieved, both operational and financial, this was an excellent year for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses. In Group Benefits, we capped off a year of outstanding earnings and solid top line growth with the Aetna acquisition. In Personal Lines, we delivered strong improvement in the underlying auto combined ratio. And in Commercial Lines, we successfully achieved top line growth while balancing underlying profitability in competitive markets. Our financial results were impacted by historic were impacted by historic industry catastrophe losses, but we're pleased with how our property book performed in these extreme events. Our claims team and the entire enterprise responded to our customers with the care and diligence our brand represents. In the midst of these tragic events, we were at our best, backing our promises and helping our customers rebuild their lives. I'd like to share a few thoughts on our 2017 financial performance for each of our business units, beginning with Group Benefits, where core earnings for the year increased to $234 million, up $30 million from 2016, with a core earnings margin of 5.8%. The group disability loss ratio for the year improved by 4.9 points due to positive pricing as well as favorable incidence and recovery trends. The group life loss ratio was very solid but up one point versus prior year due to favorable changes in reserve estimates in 2016. Looking at the top line. 2017 fully insured ongoing premium increased 14%. Excluding the two months of results from the Aetna acquisition, growth was 3%. Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business, including the business acquired from Aetna, was approximately 90% for the year, and fully insured ongoing sales of $449 million were flat with 2016. Fourth quarter sales of $103 million were up $60 million over last year, largely due to one national account sale. Integration of Aetna's group benefits business is on track. Our organizational structure is complete, and all aspects of the integration are moving forward with urgency. I'll share more details on this in a moment when I cover our 2018 outlook. In Personal Lines, core earnings for 2017 were $13 million, including catastrophe losses of $453 million before tax or 12.3 points versus our 2017 outlook of 5.8 points. The full year underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was 93, improving 2.4 points from last year due to improved auto performance. The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved by 4.2 points to 99.7 for the full year, driven by the combination of earned rate change, underwriting and change, underwriting and agency management actions. These have clearly taken hold in our book of business, and we are confident that our auto profitability improvement plan is on track. Keep in mind, when looking at our quarterly results, that fourth quarter has the highest underlying loss ratio of the year. In Commercial Lines we delivered $825 million of core earnings for the year on a combined ratio of 97.3. Catastrophe losses for the year were $383 million or 5.6 points versus our outlook of 2.3. The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 92 for the year, up 2.6 points compared to 2016. Overall, this is consistent with our expectations at the outset of 2017 and very strong absolute performance when compared to the industry and our peers. Approximately half of the increase is due to margin compression in workers' compensation and general liability, and the other half due to higher variable compensation and technology costs. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.2% for the full year, up a full point from 2016. This is a positive sign, and I'm encouraged by the recent price firming in property. In Middle Market property, price change this quarter was up 1.5 points compared to third quarter. Pricing across all other lines for the quarter was generally consistent with third quarter, with continued strong trends in auto. Our workers' compensation rates are down sequentially in the fourth quarter by about 0.5 point, driving our overall quarterly pricing change down slightly. Loss trends in workers' compensation continue to be favorable relative to historical norms. Written premium of $7 billion for the year was up 3% from 2016, driven primarily by growth in Small Commercial, including the acquisition of Maxum. Small Commercial had another outstanding year. The underlying combined ratio was 87.8, and written premium grew by over 5%, driven by strong retentions and $596 million of new business. Our competitive advantage in this business has been achieved over many years through strategic innovation, consistent investment and rigorous execution, and 2017 was no exception. We began rolling out new capabilities in ICON that allow our agents to submit excess and surplus lines business through a national wholesaler to Maxum and other underwriters as part of our Small Commercial package. Behind the scenes, we continue to simplify our quoting process to make more quotes bindable with fewer underwriting questions by using advanced data and analytics. And we expanded the functionality of our digital service platform, allowing over 30% of all of our service transactions during the year to be completed online. The momentum of this business builds by the day. In Middle Market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 96.2 for the year, up 4.7 points from 2016. This was slightly higher than our expectations due to non-CAT property losses and margin compression in general liability and workers' compensation, including an increase to policyholder dividends on certain participating workers' compensation contracts, where loss performance has been superior. We also had higher variable compensation and technology costs. Written premium increased 1% for the year based on solid retentions and new business production of $484 million, up 5% versus prior year. During 2017, we introduced a new multinational capability, allowing us to win more accounts with exposures outside the U.S. This has brought growth in domestic premium on accounts for which we might not have been able to compete in prior years. We also stood up an energy vertical, achieving solid new business premium and a growing pipeline of opportunities. And our construction practice has matured into a strong business, delivering double-digit written premium growth in 2017. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 97.8 for the year was 3.3 points higher than 2016. Nearly three points of this increase was driven by higher expenses, similar to our other commercial business units. Our Bond business posted another strong year, delivering excellent underwriting results and strong growth, the result of new and expanding projects among our policyholders as economic conditions improve. And in Financial Products, we have successfully shifted to a Middle Market-centric platform where pricing and loss trends have been more stable. Looking back on our financial results and accomplishments for 2017. We are very pleased with our execution across our businesses. Market conditions vary by business and line but have been competitive across the board. We are more confident than ever in our ability to navigate such challenges. But before I turn the call over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on our goals for 2018. In Group Benefits, continuing the successful integration of the Aetna business is a top priority. Now three months post-acquisition, we are even more enthusiastic about the team, the business and the claims technology we have acquired. Integration milestones for 2018 are in place, including actions necessary to achieve our cost synergy target of $100 million. We are underway with plans to bring the newly acquired claims management application workability into our technology platform. Once combined with our existing case management system and newly developed billing and digital engagement tools, we will have a market-leading technology suite for our customers, both individuals and employers. Overall, we're off to a great start in Group Benefits for 2018, with continuing strong core business results. January 2018 renewal retention on both our existing Hartford business as well as the acquired block has been strong, in line with prior year. And January sales are favorable to last year. We expect Group Benefits 2018 core earnings to be between $310 million and $330 million after tax. Our 2017 results included very strong partnership investment returns, which our planning assumptions do not expect to repeat in 2018. We also had better-than-expected prior year loss outcomes in 2017 that we expect to normalize in 2018. Net income, which includes integration costs, is expected to be between $275 million and $295 million after tax. In Personal Lines, building off our substantial progress in 2017, we will continue to increase our new business marketing in AARP Direct, returning to new business growth in direct auto as momentum builds throughout the year. For 2018, we expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 96 to 98, including 5.6 points of catastrophes. This implies an auto combined ratio of 97.5 to 99.5, including 1.1 point of catastrophes, putting us in line with our targets. In Commercial Lines, industry-wide evidence of margin pressure began to emerge in 2017, triggering an inflection point in the market. And as a result, we are beginning to see improvement in property pricing. I expect this trend to continue and include general liability pricing improvement during 2018 as well. Specifically, for our book of business, we expect our auto rate gains to continue in the high single digits. In property and general liability, we expect to see pricing trends improve to mid-single digits over the next four quarters. However, given favorable profitability trends in workers' compensation, rates in this line could range from flat to slightly negative. We remain committed to underwriting discipline, maintaining strong margins and seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. As is always the case, we have some very well-performing lines of business as well as some pockets of business that need price increases to reach target returns. Our pricing actions will be driven by these profitability indicators, and a key priority will be the improved performance of our Middle Market property and liability book of business. As a result, we expect an overall 2018 Commercial Lines combined ratio between 93 and 95.5, including 2.6 points of catastrophes. This represents a slight improvement from 2017 after normalizing for catastrophe losses. This is driven by our expectation of rate increases in areas of the business that are performing below targets and continuing strength in our workers' compensation results. In summary, 2017 was a very strong year of execution across our Property & Casualty and Group Benefit businesses, with core earnings of $1.1 billion. Despite the historical level of catastrophe losses, our businesses performed well and achieved progress on many strategic priorities. This work continues in 2018, and our momentum is building. Our core priorities remain unchanged; profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our distributors and outstanding value to our customers. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to briefly cover fourth quarter and full year results from the other segments and investment performance before taking your questions. Turning to Mutual Funds. Fourth quarter core earnings were $37 million, up 76% after excluding a state tax benefit recognized this quarter. Full year 2017 core earnings were $110 million, up 41% over the prior year due to higher investment management fees as market appreciation and over $3 billion in net inflows drove an 18% increase in total segment AUM to $115 billion. Investment performance remains strong, with 60% of Hartford Funds beating their peers on a five-year basis, which contributed to the robust sales. Corporate, which has been restated to include Talcott as a discontinued operation for all periods presented, had a net loss of $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter due to the $3.1 billion loss on discontinued operations and an $867 million charge resulting from U.S. corporate tax reform, reflecting a reduction in the value of net deferred tax assets. The Corporate net loss for the year was $4.5 billion. In the quarter, Corporate had core losses of $51 million, slightly better than prior year, primarily due to a state tax benefit of $5 million. For the full year, Corporate core losses totaled $229 million. Regarding Talcott, the sale and separation process is on schedule, and we expect to close by June 30. Since the transaction economics were locked in at signing, our results for the most part are not impacted by Talcott earnings going forward. The investment portfolio continues to perform well. For the quarter, net investment income, which now excludes Talcott, declined about \u2013 by about 4% to $394 million, primarily due to lower income from limited partnerships compared to the prior year. For the full year, net investment income was $1.6 billion, up 2% due to higher limited partnership returns, which were 12% before tax in 2017, well ahead of expectations. The portfolio yield for full year 2017, excluding LPs, was 3.7%, down 10 basis points from 2016 due in part to lower reinvestment rates and lower non-routine items such as make-whole payments on fixed maturities and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans. To summarize, fourth quarter core earnings were $293 million, basically flat with fourth quarter 2016, and full year 2017 core earnings were up 11% to $1 billion. For the quarter and the year, the major factors were a change to favorable prior year development, better underlying personal auto results and higher Group Benefits and Mutual Fund earnings, offset by significantly higher catastrophe losses and some deterioration in underlying Commercial Line margins, driven in part by higher expenses. Turning to the balance sheet. Our rating agency adjusted debt-to-capital ratio increased to 28.8%, up about 4 points sequentially as a result of the net loss in the quarter. We maintain our long-term goal of reducing our rating agency debt ratio to the low to mid-20s and expect debt leverage to improve over the next 12 months to 18 months due to future net income and net reduction of nearly $1 billion, as we have previously stated.  Our overall reserve position remains strong. I'd note that the annual asbestos and environmental ground-up review conducted during the fourth quarter of 2017 did not impact earnings as the $285 million in net loss development was covered by the reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company that we put in place at the end of 2016. As a reminder, that agreement covers unfavorable development of up to $1.5 billion, so there is $1.215 billion remaining under the cover.  Core earnings ROE for the last 12 months was 6.7%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. This ratio is depressed somewhat because it is calculated using average equity. If you normalize beginning equity for the loss on discontinued operations, pension transfer and tax charges, it would be closer to 8%. We expect our ROE to improve in 2018 due to earnings growth, including the impact of lower federal income taxes. Based on the metrics we provided for 2018, we would expect our core earnings ROE to be in the 11% to 12% range. In addition, over time, we will deploy the cash flows generated from the Talcott sale and from the monetization of our tax net operating losses and AMT credits into higher-return opportunities. Regarding capital management. During 2017, we repurchased about $1 billion of our common shares and increased the quarterly dividend by 9%, marking the fifth consecutive year we raised our quarterly dividend. Before taking your questions, I\u2019d like to briefly summarize the impact of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate in 2018. Our only major preference item going forward is municipal bond income as the dividend received deduction was in Talcott. So aside from the 5.25% tax rate on muni bond income, almost everything else will be taxed at 21%. Our effective tax rate will be the direct result of muni bond income as a percentage of pretax income. In other words, if muni bond income is about 23% of our total pretax earnings, which is approximately where we would expect it to be in 2018, then the effective tax rate would be about 17%. I\u2019d also note that the reduction in the corporate tax rate reduces the carrying value of the tax benefits we retained in the sale of Talcott. The tax assets we retained are now carried at approximately $700 million, down from the $950 million we discussed in December. However, the net present value of the retained tax benefit has increased as the reduction in value of the NOLs is more than offset by the accelerated monetization of the AMT credits we retained. I\u2019d also like to point out there is one aspect of the accounting for tax reform which could result in a subsequent change to the 2017 loss on the sale of Talcott. We\u2019ve provided a summary of this in the appendix to the slide deck. This change would be the result of accounting guidance that the FASB may issue later this month. That guidance is expected to either require or permit us to retrospectively reclassify certain equity amounts from retained earnings to AOCI as of December 31, 2017, or may allow prospective adoption of that change in 2018 or 2019. The amounts that would be reclassified represent the stranded tax rate differential that has already been reflected in earnings. The knock-on impact of this would be an approximate $193 million reduction in the loss on sale reported for 2017, but there would be no impact on the underlying economics of the transaction. To conclude, full year 2017 core earnings demonstrated good improvement from 2016 despite high levels of catastrophes in each quarter of the year. As we begin 2018, our priorities include continued profitable growth, integration of the Aetna business, closing the sale of Talcott, reducing debt leverage and ultimately redeploying the proceeds of the Talcott sale into higher-return opportunities. We will continue to focus on maintaining strong margins and underwriting discipline while growing where it makes sense in a market showing early signs of improving pricing dynamics. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Before beginning Q&A, I wanted to mention that Bank of America will be hosting Chris and Beth on February 14 for a fireside chat at the annual Insurance Conference. Their discussion will be webcast, and there is a link to the webcast on our \u2013 on the Investor Relations section of our website so you can listen to it live or in replay. Jack, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. Chris and Doug, I was wondering if you could comment on your thoughts of the impact of tax reform on pricing potentially going forward with respect to Personal Lines but also workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Chris Swift : Sure, Brian. I\u2019d \u2013 happy to provide some color, and Doug, I\u2019m sure, will provide his views also, which are similar. I think the dialogue and debate here on tax rate is you got to put it in the context that it\u2019s just one component of pricing. I mean, there\u2019s other components : loss trends, underwriting classifications, acquisition costs, operating costs. I mean, so it\u2019s \u2013 you need to manage all of them together. I would also say it depends on the starting point from a pricing indication side of what may or may not change at the price level to a customer. As we said in our comments, we\u2019re going to try and expect to hold on to a significant portion of the tax benefits in the near term, but we are going to put in our models for pricing purposes that are filed ultimately with regulators the new effective tax rate. I think ultimately, this will come down to then as far as, ultimately, a game theory of just what happens at the market level, what do competitive forces in the market do. But I would also state that not all lines of business are price adequate. And as I said in my prepared comments, we\u2019re going to try to improve those lines where we need price action. I think the other thing, too, I alluded to, and I\u2019m going to give you the dollar amount, but we are going to accelerate some IT investments, digital investments in product development and data and analytic investments over the next two years. I would say that incrementally is about $50 million pretax that\u2019s in our plan. It\u2019s in the guidance that we provided you. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about tax reform from more of a macro level. But Doug, what\u2019s your point of view? Doug Elliot : I guess I would just add, Chris, that I continue to think about our line profitability and our segment profitability, so feel very good about our auto progress but still more work to be done. We posted a 99.7 point of progress this year, but that doesn\u2019t leave a lot of underwriting profit, and we still have more work to do in that line. So we will see how this plays out. A lot of our pricing actions are already determined for 2018, and we\u2019re determined to improve our profitability, particularly in Middle Market and Personal Lines auto. So we will continue to talk about this and share as we go forward. I think it\u2019s still early. Brian Meredith : Got you. And then one for Beth. Beth, just thinking about taxes and tax reform and elimination of the AMT, what is the kind of cash benefit that you expect kind of on an annual basis from just the reduction in cash taxes paid? Beth Bombara : I\u2019m sorry, how much is the benefit or where is it going? Brian Meredith : Yes. With the benefit, you gave us the present value number, but I\u2019m just kind of thinking, are you going to pay any cash taxes in 2018 now? What is it going to look like from a cash flow perspective for you guys? Beth Bombara : Right. So looking at 2018, we\u2019d expect to pay little to no tax in 2018. As it relates to the AMT credits that we\u2019ll be able to monetize over time, that will really start when we file our 2018 tax return in 2019. So we\u2019ll start to see those cash flows coming through as well. So when we look at both our NOLs and AMT credits and based on our current projections for taxable income, we\u2019d expect to monetize those over the next three to four years. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. My first question is on personal auto. If you look at your rate increases, still in the double digits, I assume your loss cost trend probably in the mid to single digits. So there should be 5 point improvements in the core underlying margin going forward. So I just wonder why the guidance is only sort of showing 150 basis points to the midpoint. Are there more to come? Doug Elliot : Kai, this is Doug. I would start by suggesting that over the next couple of quarters, you\u2019ll see the written pricing come down a little bit. So our earned trends now that we\u2019re achieving improved profitability are going to be slightly less than we\u2019ve had in the past. The other thing is we had very good trends across our frequency and severity in 2017. Hard to suggest they\u2019re going to repeat next year, so I \u2013 we try to be thoughtful and conservative in our selections going forward. I think those two combinations still imply that we will see improvement in the auto line underlying going forward. We\u2019d love to see the same rate of change in 2018 that we saw in 2017. But we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. Kai Pan : Okay. Then my second question on Commercial Line, could you talk a little bit more about the loss cost trend in workers\u2019 compensation and general liability? And what gave you confidence to achieve the improvements, given that the 2017 results was \u2013 fell sort of the original guidance? Doug Elliot : Sure. Our overall workers\u2019 comp performance has been very strong, and that goes back a number of years. And although we tweaked it a bit in 2017, I still look at the overall performance and feel very good about it, particularly in our Small Commercial world. So that\u2019s just as a starter. As we move forward, I think our sophistication in underwriting and the work we\u2019re doing in claim to work and combat, if you will, trends that we expect to see in medical and in wage, give me confidence that we will be able to continue to produce very solid returns, right? And I \u2013 every time I think about my answer on a workers\u2019 comp question, I do ask you to think about Small versus National Accounts versus Middle Market. They compete very differently. The results vary. But in general, we look across our segments. We feel good about the line. Our trends have been very solid. The frequency has been in very good shape for a number of years. We\u2019re watching severity around medical. It\u2019s still better than historical norms, but we are watching the hospitalization end of those costs. And as we go forward, we\u2019ll kind of compete month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter and make sure we\u2019re reflecting that in the pricing accordingly. Kai Pan : Thank you very much. Doug Elliot : Kai, let me add one other \u2013 as I was answering that question, I was thinking also about your Personal Lines question. I think we\u2019ve shared in the past that we are going to ramp up our marketing spend in Personal Lines. So when you think about the overall combined ratio, expect to see a little bit more cost in the Personal Lines expense component of combined. That's also adding to a part of the answer that I shared with you. Kai Pan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Good morning. I guess this is following up on some of the earlier questions. As we think about the underlying margin guidance, and this is both a Personal and Commercial Lines question, it seems like your commentary points to some improvement on the loss ratio and potentially higher expense ratios, given investments in both of the businesses. Is that how you see it when you think about 2018 with the spread between the loss and the expense ratios? Chris Swift : Elyse, it's Chris. I would say, from a higher level, yes, generally the case. I mean, we think we could obviously get some rate in the book. We're going to try to manage frequencies and severities to a good outcome, but we are going to continue to invest in the organization, both IT, digital product. I would say that our expenses issue were probably a little elevated, primarily compensation related from our goals in performance side. So I would say that there is going to be a reversion to the mean going forward on compensation costs. But as far as investments in those areas that I described, that'll continue at a healthy pace. Doug Elliot : Elyse, I would add as well that we're working mix of lines of business as well underneath the broad scenario. So as an example, I did talk about surety. Surety has been a growing \u2013 with a solid performance in 2017. Our top line in surety was up 10%. It's one of our outstanding return areas. We're going to do more in surety. And so we're also mixing the book underneath. Auto is showing signs of improvement in Commercial Lines as well as Personal Lines, so that's an improvement story. So we're battling hard to, number one, maintain the strong margins we've achieved, but to see if we can do a little bit better in 2018. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then another question. In terms of auto, in your guide for this year, you get to about that 96.5, which has been your target for that business. And you did 0.2 still taking rate in the high single digits. So maybe this is more when we think out beyond 2018, but do you think you can run that business better than a 96.5? Because meaning, if you keep taking high single-digit rates, essentially, you could get the margin lower or then where we just see greater expenses as well in that business. Chris Swift : Elyse, it's Chris. I would say, again, as I pivoted, and Doug has been talking about, too, I mean, we're trying to return to growth, right? I mean, we've had to take some aggressive actions with the book in shrinking it. So I would say that the growth aspect of it will contribute to obviously an expanding combined ratio while we continue to manage loss cost in trends. And I would say, again, it's going to be a dynamic marketplace out there, too. I mean, there is a lot of strong competition in this area. We're focused in on the more of the mature market segment with a value proposition that is somewhat different. So we remain confident that we can grow and return to the higher levels of premium volumes, which should also generate some relief on the expense ratio. But make no mistake, I mean, it's still going to be very, very competitive. Doug Elliot : Elyse, just \u2013 I certainly echo all of Chris' focus comments on growth. The other thing I would just point out, I think I mentioned returning to mid-single digits as opposed to higher single digits. So I expect pricing over the next several quarters to be more in that five range than the higher single digits. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that\u2019 great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : Thank you. Beth, can you talk about the potential for share buybacks to restart and the timing on that and what we should think about in terms of magnitude of buybacks in 2018? Beth Bombara : Yes. So Jay, I'll go back to the comments that we made in the fourth quarter when we stopped our share buyback due to the Aetna acquisition. We'll be back to you when we have a new capital management plan. But right now, we're focused on closing Talcott, and then we'll evaluate what the best use of that capital is and the timing, but not prepared to talk today about expectations for 2018. Jay Gelb : Okay. And then my follow-up, and this is \u2013 I remember sort of asking this question on the Talcott call. I believe now that the expectation is for an 11% to 12% return on equity in 2018, I believe back when Talcott was announced, the expectation was for that to improve in 2019 as the full benefit of the Aetna transaction comes into play. Is that still the case for 2019? Chris Swift : Jay, it's Chris. I think the \u2013 I probably led that charge on the improvement. And I would say, generally, directionally, we still see it, but I mean, there's going to be some competing forces, right? So we always try to stay focused on hand on what we need to do in 2018 that sets up a good 2019. So know our focus is on executing, particularly as it relates to standing up Talcott as a separate company, integrating Aetna and making sure we're getting all the expense saves out of there, which obviously from an earnings side, I will contribute in 2019. But on the other hand, we are \u2013 with that 11% to 12% guide, that does reflect a significant tax benefit in 2018 that we'll have to see how that plays out in 2019 and 2020 and beyond. So that would be the only caveat that I would share with you. There could be some competing forces that impact that trend going forward. Jay Gelb : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : The first question, it looks like there are some competitors in the auto market who will be stepping up to make customer growth a priority for 2018. Can you talk a little about the sales proposition at the AARP business and how you retain those customers and how those customers might be less risky to be picked off by a more aggressive competitor in the market? Doug Elliot : Let me try to tackle, Josh, that in a few pieces. Number one, we're certainly ramping up marketing, as I mentioned, so that we get more client contact, we get more inbound activity. And based on our marketing evidence in the last 90 days, that's happening. So we're feeling more flow. Second part is our ability to close, offer competitive prices and then close. And so we're focused on our skills on the phone. We're focused on our fine-tuning of our auto class plan. Again, this is a state-by-state mix dynamic. So there are a lot of dynamics that we are working on, all trying to improve our close ratio on those inbound calls. And again, we're going to continue to move our marketing spend up as we move throughout 2018. So I expect this to be a growing positive story, but we'll have to work our way through the first 90 days, and then we'll share progress as we move throughout the year. Josh Shanker : All right. I'll take one more stab at the $25,000 question that Jay asked. In \u2013 your preference is obviously to do a transaction, I think, overdo buybacks if the right transaction came along. But what is your appetite for letting a war chest build or the priority about returning capital as it builds to shareholders? Is there a philosophy internally about what to do with money as it comes in? Christ Swift : Yes. I appreciate the question, Josh. Yes, what I would say, again, in the follow-up to Jay's question, I mean, we've got a lot of levers still to continue to expand ROE. So as much as \u2013 and we talked about some competing forces that might be happening. I mean, there are levers that we have to be able to help manage to expand ROE beyond that 11% to 12% that we guided to in 2018. And clearly, capital management is one of them. So I think you've seen our history. We balanced. We're thoughtful. We're, if anything, consistent. So I would expect that philosophy to continue. I don't think there's a calculus I could share with you right now, but as excess capital builds, we know we have to deploy it effectively or return it to shareholders in a timely basis. And that's what I would say right now. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much for the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Doug, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense as to the auto claim frequency trends that you've embedded in current pricing? Doug Elliot : Well, certainly, 2017, we've talked about them, right, so we feel very good. Our frequency has essentially been flat. We've had low severities, low single-digit severities. We are looking forward at similar frequency trends for 2018, and I would say small single-digit severity trends in the two to four range. So not a lot different in 2018 than what we think we're experiencing today, what we are expressing today. And that's as much as I want to give on the guidance front. Meyer Shields : No, that's good. It's helpful. And second question, as we anticipate stronger U.S. economic growth, does that have any implications on its own for margins in workers' compensation and in Maxum? Doug Elliot : Where we have felt that strong economy certainly is in our Bond business with construction start-ups. We've had a number of nice opportunities in our construction unit, in new projects, shovels in the ground, et cetera. And obviously, we continue to fill in Small Commercial. So the start-ups, the new economy, the small employee groups, under five, where we have a terrific product, and we have a lot of focus in that micro segment of Small. So those areas are clearly signs that we're bullish about. And I think we'll see more of that as we move through 2018. Overall, a solid economy is a good indicator of workers' comp and disability. So we understand that our trends relative to employment are good signals for key lines for us. And we have our fingers crossed that we'll see a very solid economy moving forward that we'll be able to grow from moving into 2018. Meyer Shields : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is open. Bob Glasspiegel : We've had sort of a turbulent financial market in the first quarter. I wonder if you could just talk about your overall investment strategy going into the market and whether you're in a derisking, rerisking, looking at this as an opportunity to buy. How are you repositioning portfolio through this? Chris Swift : Bob, let me start, and then Brion Johnson, our CIO, is with us here, and ask him to give you some additional color. But generally, I think we feel very good. And we\u2019ve got a high-quality portfolio, well diversified. We\u2019ve traded out of certain sectors a while ago that we did not think held its potential for returns. So the largest concentration we have is still in munis and in corporate investment-grade bonds. So generally, we feel very good. I mean \u2013 and if you look closely at the tape, I mean, credit spreads are holding in fairly well. We\u2019ll see how trading goes today. So to the extent that the equity markets have been rolled over, corrected a little bit, we\u2019re not seeing the same pressure to date in the credit environment. But Brion, what would you add? Brion Johnson : So thanks for your question, Bob. I would say that Chris articulated it well. We take a sort of a through-the- cycle approach to the investment portfolio. We\u2019re very comfortable with the status of the portfolio. It is a high- quality portfolio. And over time, we have been lowering the risk profile of the portfolio just as the cycle got longer and the compensation for risk got lower. So since we\u2019ve been doing that, we\u2019re pretty reasonably well positioned for the environment that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re nibbling around the edges where we see opportunities, but we\u2019re we see opportunities, but we\u2019re not inclined to change the overall risk profile of the portfolio in response to recent developments. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up. First quarter weather in the Northeast sometimes nails you, cold and frozen roofs. Have issues yet that you\u2019d spike out, Doug? Or\u2026 Chris Swift : Bob, again, I\u2019m looking at Doug, too. There\u2019s nothing that hits our radar screen. I mean, you\u2019re always going to have some frozen pipes. I was in Minneapolis earlier this week, and it was cold, and \u2013 but it\u2019s the winter. So \u2013 but nothing\u2019s hit our desk as anything outsized right now, Doug, would you say? Doug Elliot : I agree with that. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. First, I had a question on Personal Lines. As you think about the price hikes that you\u2019ve been implementing, obviously, those have helped your margins recover. Have you been able to raise prices through all the states? Or are there states that are still pending that haven\u2019t fully flown through yet? Doug Elliot : Jimmy, there are still states that we are working on. So we\u2019ve achieved rate adequacy in a number of states, the large majority of the states, certainly majority. But there\u2019s still a couple of key states that are working. And California is one of those states that made a lot of progress, but we have a little bit more work to do as we move into 2018. Jimmy Bhullar : And I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a material part of your business? Doug Elliot : It is. It\u2019s a significant part of our Personal Lines business. Jimmy Bhullar : Then on just \u2013 so what\u2019s your expectation for lapses on the Aetna group business as you onboard it? And are there any concerns that they sold a lot of business on a bundle or cross-sold business with major medical? And even though you\u2019re going to be doing it, it\u2019s still a separate company. So what\u2019s your expectation for lapses as you onboard the book? Chris Swift : Jimmy, it\u2019s Chris. All the \u2013 and Doug made the commentary on it. All the data that we see, we knew going into it. We\u2019re not surprised. We are obviously trying to renew as much of that business as possible. We understood their pricing approach and philosophy. We\u2019re harmonizing it with ours. We\u2019ll be thoughtful. I would still say that, again, the guidance that we provided, I mean, there is a tolerance for shock lapses in 2018 that we\u2019re going to try to manage to avoid. But I think we have a reasonable to conservative plan on premiums from a lapse side. And Doug, I know we got weekly integration meetings, and we\u2019re trying to manage to outperform that, Jimmy, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any surprises. And we\u2019ve got similar experience with profit improvement on certain accounts in our book over the years, and we\u2019ll execute very thoughtfully. Doug Elliot : And Jimmy, you know how far in advance this book works, right? So we didn\u2019t expect to see much shock lapse in 2018 because much of that had been renewed over the course of the spring and summer months, certainly, the National Account book. We are right in the throes of working hard on the 2019 book. Chris and I are heavily involved in the key account decisions. So literally, I felt like we have information we\u2019re not sharing. We are working over the next 90 to 120 days on key 2019 renewals. And I think we\u2019ve built in some shock, but based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, we feel very good about the way the integration\u2019s going, the sales force coming together, the tools and technology road map. So I\u2019m optimistic about how this is coming together, and I think our plans are well-thought-out. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just lastly, for Beth, can you quantify stranded overhead from Talcott that might need to be allocated to the other businesses? And how was that accounted for this quarter? Beth Bombara : Yes. So we estimate that when we look at the costs that aren\u2019t transferring with the transaction, it\u2019s probably $35 million to $40 million annually, and we expect to eliminate those stranded costs over the next 18 to 24 months. So I don\u2019t see that as being a significant drag for our businesses. You\u2019ll see some of those costs in the corporate line until we close. But again, when you think about the size of our expense base, it\u2019s a pretty small amount. Jimmy Bhullar : And that\u2019s stranded as well as allocated? Because there\u2019s some probably corporate overhead that\u2019s allocated to Talcott that\u2019ll be \u2013 that\u2019ll have to be allocated to the rest of the business. Beth Bombara : Yes, that\u2019s how I\u2019m defining stranded. I\u2019m looking at all the costs that we previously allocated to Talcott, looking at those things that I know we\u2019re transferring, those things that we know will just get eliminated right away. And then this is the \u2013 really the overhead piece that we have to address. Jimmy Bhullar : And this quarter that number was still in discontinued operations? Or was that allocated out of that already? Beth Bombara : It\u2019s already \u2013 it\u2019s in the corporate line. It\u2019s kind of hard to see for the quarter, but yes, it\u2019s in the corporate line. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the presenters. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. And if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow up with the Investor Relations team. Thank you again, and we look forward to seeing you \u2013 some of you next week in New York. Goodbye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. All participants may now disconnect.",

And thank you for joining us today. Our results this quarter were excellent with solid underwriting and investment performance. Higher pretax results were the primary driver of earnings growth with the added benefit of lower tax rates. Core earnings per diluted share of $1.27 were up 67% over first quarter 2017 and up in each of our four major businesses. In P&C, underlying combined ratio was improved for both commercial lines and personal lines with better auto results in each segment. In addition, lower catastrophe losses and favorable prior year development contributed to higher underwriting results. All of our markets remain competitive. But that said, we are confident in our ability to execute and grow in this environment. In commercial lines, the pricing trend is mostly positive and we achieved higher rates in property and liability lines. However, Workers\u2019 compensation renewal premium rates are generally flat to slightly down, reflecting the favorable loss experienced of the last several years. Doug will provide more insights into pricing trends. Group Benefits core earnings more than doubled to $85 million this quarter, driven by improved disability results, earnings on the acquired business and lower taxes, offset by higher mortality on the life business. In addition, first quarter of 2017 had a guarantee fund assessment for Penn Treaty. Disability trends continues to improve but were offset somewhat by elevated mortality. We think this variation was within a normal range of mortality experienced, especially in the first quarter, which is historically more volatile. Mutual Funds posted excellent growth in earnings and AUM with positive net flows and healthy market appreciation from a year ago. Net investment income was up 10%, mostly due to higher invested assets with virtually no net credit impairments. Limited Partnership returns were very strong this quarter. Lastly, we are hard at work on the integration of the Group Benefits acquisition and the separation of Talcott Resolution. Both of these major projects are proceeding as planned with dedicated multidisciplinary teams working collaboratively and on schedule. We expect Talcott sale to close by June 30th. As a leading insurer of U.S. businesses and their employees, we benefited from increased employment in small business formations, particularly in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits over the last few years. We may see additional growth if the lower more competitive U.S. corporate tax structure increases GDP growth and employment. With regard to the quarter, I am pleased with our top line growth in Commercial Lines. Small commercial new business grew 8% with momentum in both our Standard Commercial book and Maxum our E&S specialist. The top line was just shy of $1 billion of net written premium, putting $4 billion annual level within range, and up from $3.2 billion in 2014. We expect Small Commercial\u2019s growth to continue this year, including the impact of the recent renewal rights agreement with Foremost, which will take effect in July. This book is comprised of small commercial business segments that we know well and underwrite profitably. Combined with our best in class technology, customer service and claims capabilities, this deal will generate an attractive return for us. Group Benefits\u2019 earned premium grew 66% this quarter from both the acquisition and strong new sales along with solid persistency. Our market presence across all customer segments has improved, particularly in national accounts, which we expect will help drive additional growth from expanded market opportunities. Looking forward, investing in our company remains the cornerstone of our strategy. We want to achieve profitable organic growth, particularly where we have attractive margins and strong competitive advantages. This requires developing better data and analytical tools and expertise, including leveraging our new claim system which some of you have seen in action. We also want to become an easier company to do business with. This requires investments, especially in technology. The technology initiatives currently underway include a new Commercial Lines policy administration system, which is a multiyear project. Another initiative is the integration of Aetna's disability claim system across the combined group benefits book. This integration, which is on schedule for completion by year-end, will give our customers market differentiating capabilities for absence management. With customers expecting us to provide digital service and capabilities similar to what they experienced at other companies, like Amazon, we must continue to build better digital interfaces for agents and policyholders. These investments will create faster turnaround times, reduce costs, improve ease-of-use and increase efficiency and customer service satisfaction. For instance, our automated certificate of insurance capability available 24x7 has dramatically decreased response times at a fraction of the cost from our prior process. Finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to spend a few minutes on our capital management strategy and objectives. With our business is achieving returns well above our cost of capital, I want to be clear that we prefer to invest for profitable organic growth. However, we will not compromise our underwriting or pricing standards just to grow the top line. We will remain disciplined. From a strategic perspective, we believe acquisitions can help build greater competitive advantages and accelerate earnings growth. The Aetna acquisition is an example of that, and we\u2019re really pleased with its performance. However, acquisitions are often expensive, especially in today's markets, and they have execution risks that need to be clearly understood. Currently, our primary focus is in the Commercial Lines space where we are building broader risk and underwriting expertise organically. We will consider financially accretive acquisitions that accelerate these goals. And to-date the deals that we have done in commercial lines have been smaller bolt-on transactions. As the specific areas of interest, we are particularly focused on specialty lines and industry verticals. There are, however, certain product lines or businesses, such as reinsurance, that we do not currently view a strategic. That should not imply we would never buy a company that has a minor or small reinsurance portfolio, but it does mean that the majority of the business would need to align with or complement our Commercial Lines strategies. And it has to meet our financial objectives, meaning that we expect an acquisition to deliver returns above our cost of equity capital in a reasonable period of time. We measure that return by future earnings power and capital efficiency, including expense savings, improved underwriting results, growth synergies, other benefits produced by the acquisition. In addition to organic growth and acquisitions, capital management is an important tool for creating shareholder value. We have been and continue to evaluate the best use of deployable capital, including the anticipated proceeds from the Talcott sale. And we continue to weigh business opportunities against share repurchases and other capital management actions. Our goal, consistent with our track record of a balanced approach to capital management, is to optimize deployable capital for shareholder value creation while maintaining a strong balance sheet. And as a fellow shareholder, I assure you that we will continue to be thoughtful and disciplined in our approach. We will not make hasty decisions and we do not feel rushed to make long-term impactful choices. Rather, we will be patient and thoughtful regarding these matters. To wrap up my comments, 2018 is off to a great start with solid financial results and opportunity to grow in each of our businesses. I am excited about the many initiatives underway, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, I will turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First quarter results for property and casualty and Group Benefits were excellent, with each of our business units executing effectively against their priorities. Commercial Lines posted a very strong quarter as markets remain competitive. In Personal Lines, auto margins continued to improve. And Group Benefits had an outstanding quarter of strong core earnings growth even after adjusting for the Penn Treaty guaranty fund assessment in first quarter 2017. All our businesses benefited this quarter from favorable net investment income results, and in P&C lower catastrophe losses versus prior year. Let me provide some detail on our business unit performance. The Commercial Lines\u2019 first quarter combined ratio was 93.3, improving 2.7 points from 2017. The decrease was primarily due to underlying margin improvement in auto, the result of pricing and underwriting actions taken in recent years and a swing to favorable prior year development versus adverse development last year. The prior year development was primarily driven by Workers\u2019 Compensation where our loss trends have been favorable. Property and commercial auto also were slightly favorable. The underlying combined ratio for commercial lines, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, remains very solid at 90.4, improving 0.5 point from 2017. Market conditions showed some signs of price swing in the quarter, yet continue to remain competitive. I remain pleased with our execution on the front-line. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 2.5% for the first quarter, down 30 basis points from last quarter, primarily driven by small commercial workers\u2019 compensation. Our margins on this book of business remain very healthy and renewal written pricing remains positive, giving us a strong foundation for competing in the marketplace. In middle market, renewal pricing was very competitive in January, but February and March showed more positive signs with prices increasing in all major lines in the back half for the quarter. I expect further positive rate movement in the quarters ahead for property and GL and continued strong pricing for auto, the lines most in need of margin improvement. Our middle market business still needs more rate and I suspect that we are not unique in that regard. We believe the appropriate path is to continue pushing for rate increases, consistent with long-term loss cost trends and to maintain underwriting discipline even though retention has come under pressure. Small commercial had an excellent first quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.5. Written premium grew 1% with $166 million of new business. This is our largest new business quarter in history, up 8% from last year. New business from the recently announced foremost renewal rights deal will begin in early third quarter and our team has been active in recent months working with agents to prepare for successful transition. We're excited about expanding our relationship with many of our current agents, while adding new partners through this transaction. This opportunity leverages the power of our small commercial platform to grow top and bottom line through inorganic consolidation, complementing the organic growth success we've achieved in recent years. Middle market delivered an underlying combined ratio of 92.2 for the first quarter, improving 1.6 points from 2017, mainly due to lower commission expense this quarter and slightly better margins in several lines. Written premium increased 4% based on solid retentions and strong new business production of the $141 million. The increase in written premium versus last year is coming primarily from our specialized practice teams, including our expanding construction and energy verticals. Written premium in our traditional block of business was essentially flat to 2017, impacted by continued soft pricing and excess market capacity. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying commodity ratio of 97.5 was flat to 2017 as slight margin deterioration in financial products and national accounts was offset by lower commissions, driven by the mix of business. Written premium was down 2% for the quarter, largely due to a decrease in bond, which had a very strong first quarter of 2017. Personal Lines continues to show progress with an underlying commodity ratio of 89.8 for the first quarter, improving 1.4 points from a year ago. In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio was 94.2, 2.4 points better than 2017. Loss cost trends remain within our expectations in the low single-digit range. I\u2019m increasingly positive about our improving financial performance in recent quarters. Returning to written premium growth for Personal Lines remains a priority for us. Our higher expense ratio in the quarter reflects our increased marketing efforts and ARP direct auto. Early response rates have been strong, but our conversion ratios are not where they need to be for us to grow. We have a number of initiatives underway to lift our close rate, and I expect new business to increase over the course of 2018 as our price increases continue to moderate as well. In Group Benefits, core earnings for the quarter were $85 million with a margin of 5.6%, driven by favorable disability results, the recently acquired book of business from Aetna and lower tax rates, offset by higher mortality in our life book of business. The lower disability loss ratio reflects better than expected incidents and recovery trends across multiple action years. This favorability was offset by higher life loss ratio. There are two drivers here. The most significant factor accounting for approximately two thirds of the increase is the mix of the Group Life book toward larger accounts, resulting from the Aetna book of business. We expected these large accounts have a lower expense ratio and run a higher loss ratio consistent with our own historical national accounts experience. The second factor is slightly higher mortality this quarter across the entire life book. At the moment, we see this as normal volatility and we will monitor it carefully to ensure that we react appropriately if necessary. Persistency on the combined employer group block of business was approximately 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were very strong at $454 million. It was an excellent sales quarter across all market segments and product lines, with an especially strong start to the year in voluntary. As Chris shared, we\u2019re very pleased with the pace of our integration on the Aetna Group Life and disability business. Our go forward leadership team is in place. We are currently installing Aetna\u2019s disability claim platform on our infrastructure, and plans to begin converting business in early 2019 are on track. On an annualized run rate basis, we\u2019ve achieved $60 million of the $100 million target for expense reductions consistent with our goals. A large portion of this comes from the corporate cost and IT finance and marketing. We have also solidified our line of sight to the balance of our target reductions in claim, product, underwriting and other business functions. All-in the integration has been very successful thus far. The teams have become one and we are executing effectively, both internally and in the marketplace. In summary, we were off to a very solid start in first quarter 2018 across all our businesses. We remain focused, disciplined and balanced in our execution to deliver profitable growth. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug, I am going to briefly cover first quarter results for the investment portfolio, mutual funds and corporate, and provide an update on the Talcott sale before taking your questions. Core earnings for our P&C and Group Benefits businesses included continued excellent investment results both from an income and credit perspective. For the quarter, net investment income totaled $451 million, up 10% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to the fourth quarter 2017 Group Benefits acquisition, which added about $3.4 billion in invested asset to the portfolio. In addition, LP investment income was up $15 million with annualized returns of about 19% compared with 16% in first quarter 2017. As you may recall, our outlook for LP return is about 6%, reflecting a longer term view and the expectation that returns may moderate as the cycle progresses. Excluding LPs, investment income was up 7% and the portfolio yield was 3.7%, down slightly from first quarter 2017 due to the impact of the Group Benefits acquisitions. As a reminder, the acquired investment portfolio was mark-to-mark on the date of the acquisition, reducing the portfolio yield and group benefits, excluding LPs, from 4.3% in third quarter 2017 to 3.8% in first quarter 2018. P&C investment yields, excluding LPs, were essentially flat over the last year averaging 3.7% in first quarter 2018, which is also consistent with reinvestment rates in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect to forecast yields over the balance of 2018 to be relatively consistent with 2017. My final note on the investment portfolio is that credit performance remains strong with no net impairments in the quarter and only $8 million before tax over the last four quarters. The low level of impairments reflects an overall benign credit environment and the careful underwriting of our portfolio. Turning to mutual funds, first quarter core earnings was $34 million, up almost 50% from last year due to combination of lower tax rate and higher investment management fees. Income before taxes was up 23%, reflecting 17% increase in investment management fees, driven by higher average assets under management. Investment performance remained strong with 68% of Hartford Fund beating their peers on a five year basis. Net flows totaled $678 million in the quarter, including particularly strong flows in exchange traded products, which totaled about $194 million this quarter compared with $22 million in the first quarter 2017. Core losses for the corporate category totaled $66 million, up from $52 million in first quarter 2017 due to the impact of lower tax rates. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes in corporate was actually $10 million lower than last year, but the offsetting tax benefit was $21 million lower due to the reduction in tax rates. During March, we completed two debt transactions, repaying $320 million of 6.3% senior notes and issuing $500 million of 30 year senior notes at a coupon of 4.4%. Looking forward, this June we will call at par $500 million of hybrids with a coupon of 8% and 18%. As a result of these transactions, interest expense will decrease by $2 million before tax sequentially in the second quarter and then decrease by an additional $8 million before tax per quarter beginning in the third quarter. Taken together, these actions will reduce outstanding debt by about $320 million by the end of the second quarter and reduce our average coupon rate and total annual fixed charges. At March 31, 2018, our rating agency adjusted debt to capital ratio, which takes into the account pension liabilities, equity credit for hybrids and AOCI, was 29.9%, up from 28.8% at year end. The increase is primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates reducing AOCI. Total debt to capitalization, excluding AOCI, was essentially flat at 27.9% compared with 28% at year end. Through earnings and debt repayment overtime, we expect to reduce our rating agency debt to total capital to our target in the low to mid 20s. In total, first quarter core earnings were $461 million, up $173 million from first quarter 2017. Core earnings benefits from higher P&C, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds\u2019 pretax earnings, as well as the lower corporate tax rate. On a pretax basis, core earnings rose about 48% or $183 million, while income taxes only increased $10 million as the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations decreased from 24% in first quarter 2017 to about 18% in first quarter 2018. The core earnings ROE was 7.8% this quarter compared with 5.1% a year ago. Keep in mind that this is a trailing 12 month calculation not an annualized return for the quarter, so it includes the impact of high catastrophe losses in the last three quarters of 2017, as well as the higher corporate tax rates last year. As we have stated previously, we expect the 2018 core earnings ROE to be in the 11% to 12% range. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was $36.71, up 4% from December 31 2017 due to the impact of earnings less dividends. Book value per diluted share was $36.06, down 3% from December 31, 2017 as higher interest rates reduced AOCI. I know many will look at all in book value for P&C companies, so as a reminder, our March 31, 2018 shareholders equity includes $892 million of AOCI for assets that are part of Talcott. Therefore, we would expect June 30, 2018 book value per diluted share to be reduced by about $2.45 from March 31, 2018 upon the closing of the sale. As an update, the Talcott sales process remains on schedule to close by June 30th. As part of the regulatory approval process, the Connecticut insurance commissioner has scheduled a hearing for May 17th after which the state has up to 30 days to issue a ruling. Aside from the regulatory approval, the work to separate Talcott is well underway. Under the terms of the sale, we will continue to provide certain transition services to Talcott for up to two years, and we have a five year contract to manage their investment portfolio. The fees and expenses for those services will be included in our corporate segment going forward. After expenses, we expect that the Talcott sale will generate net cash proceeds to the holding company of approximately $1.7 billion, including $300 million of pre-closing dividends. In addition, the holding company will retain total tax benefits of about $700 million, including NOLs and AMC credits. To conclude, the first quarter was a good start to the year with underwriting and investment results remaining quite strong despite catastrophe losses higher than our outlook. While the capital markets have been more volatile recently, like most insurance companies, our investment income will benefit from a higher rate environment overtime so long as inflation trends are modest. In addition, equity market values remain high helping generate strong returns on our private equity limited partnership portfolio. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. Before the operator Amy gives the Q&A instructions, I wanted to remind everyone of our upcoming Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 16th. Please remember to vote your proxies. Amy, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay, your line is open. Jay Cohen : As you think about M&A in the commercial business, I\u2019d love to get a sense of past deals, well, specifically Maxum. I guess that\u2019s around the larger ones you\u2019ve done, in the commercial business. Can you -- and it disappears within your organization. Can you give us a sense of the returns you\u2019ve been able to generate since you\u2019ve acquired that? And then secondly the smaller question, with Foremost, I think that premiums there were roughly $200 million. Any sense of how much you expect to keep on renewal? Chris Swift : On both these, we will tack in between Doug and myself. On Foremost, it is about $200 million block of premiums, and a lot of it depends on the persistency and the rollover. I think we feel very good about signing up the agents and in their authorization, and more importantly data to easily quote this. So it\u2019s hard to predict. But I suspect we\u2019ll keep 75% of the overall book long-term. On Maxum, I would say that was relatively a small deal. And if you remember, it was approximately $200 million-ish we spent. We went through some level of restructuring and shutting down certain aspects of their business model, really to build the new small commercial E&S model, which we\u2019re very pleased with. I think on earnings basis to think about it, we\u2019re making about $10 million to $15 million after tax in core earnings. We\u2019ve avoided some businesses that were unprofitable and we\u2019re really excited about the opportunity to integrate E&S into our quoting platform. Doug, what would you add? Doug Elliot : So on the Foremost piece, Jay, mid-17s would include some shock loss from our normal run rate retention in small. So we\u2019re anticipating that. We won\u2019t -- we\u2019ll not run as strong as we run our normal retention, very excited about that. And as we talk about early third quarter just so you're all aware, we're quoting 90 days out in advance. So we're actually right now in market quoting July actively, but the premium won\u2019t hit the books for a couple months. On the Maxum side, very strategic opportunity for us. We didn't have E&S talent in this organization, we didn't have relationships on the distribution side. And we clearly wanted to challenge ourselves with a product breadth opportunity in the small commercial and middle market arena. So just getting started many of you know that we now have expanded our product capability in small, including an E&S opportunity on our ICON quoting platform very excited about the early days but we\u2019ll be talking more about it over time. I think it bodes well and it has a bigger opportunity for us to be a broader deeper player in small commercial over time. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is open. Brian Meredith : I guess first quick one for Beth. Can you remind us what is the stranded cost from Talcott, how much that was in the quarter and how that is going to be running off here over the course of next 12 months to 18 months? Beth Bombara : So when we think about cost and again stranded cost, we think about as costs that were allocated to Talcott overhead cost and obviously would not go with the transaction. And on an annualized basis, we see that in the $35 million to $40 million range, and that\u2019s pretty even across the quarters. And our expectation is over the next 12 months to 18 months, we\u2019ll see those costs reduce. Again, we will be providing some transition services to Talcott over that period as well and being reimbursed for some of those costs as they continue to use some of our infrastructure. So we\u2019ll have a slight offset to that but it\u2019s in that range. Brian Meredith : And those are sitting in your corporate line item right now? Beth Bombara : Yes, we have that [technical difficulty] and they\u2019re included in core earnings. Brian Meredith : And then Chris, Doug, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about just the competitive environment out there. What's happening with workers' comp insurance? Clearly, an areas that you're seeing some pressure on pricing. Is it worse than you\u2019d anticipated, is that at all questioning maybe where your underlying combined ratio guidance is for the year for the commercial space? Chris Swift : Brian, I just quickly then get out of the way and let Doug share with you his thoughts. But as we sit here today, as I said in my comments, we got off to a terrific start and we feel really good about our ability to execute and in a competitive complex environment. So all the guidance that we\u2019ve provided or drivers, we still feel very good about. And in fact, if you saw in certain drivers, whether it\u2019d be combined ratio and personal lines or commercial lines, we\u2019re outperforming. But there will be a little bit of a reversion to the mean over the next nine months. But I\u2019m really pleased with the team, how we\u2019re standing up and new capabilities, new product sets and being disciplined while we\u2019re pushing for more business with our distribution partners. But Doug what would you add technically? Doug Elliot : A few things start with very pleased with the way the first quarter pricing trends ended. So Brian, a bit disappointed in our January performance on pricing, made some adjustments, looked at our book harder and feel really good about progress we made in February and March. And I expect that progress to continue into the second quarter. Secondly, I would always ask you to continue to think about small commercial versus middle over our other markets, so different dynamics, different pricing issues across those and different mixes for us in those areas. And then obviously there is a workers\u2019 comp versus the non-workers\u2019 comp. So we\u2019re pleased with our February-March pricing and see some lift in property, GL, continued in auto and I expect that to continue. I expect that to continue over the next three quarters, particularly as I shared in my script, in middle market we need right net book. Our non-specialty middle book needs more rate and we intend to go after and chase it and do the right things. Relative to comp, our numbers across our markets but especially in small commercial and workers comp, are very good, very good. And they are also very good across industry in general. So this is leading to the pressure on your rates. It\u2019s leading to experience factors for insurers that are looking more favorable. And because of that, I think we have a more competitive marketplace. The other thing just in closing we are watching loss trends very carefully, and they have been consistently in a very good spot for an extended period with workers comp. Little bit of frequency uptick back to more zero range in last couple quarters. And clearly, there are inflationary pressures around that we are watching medical carefully. So when I put them together, yes, I think there are some things that probably will cause some compression in workers\u2019 comp line. But relative to where we are, I feel like we are working our leverage being thoughtful about our territories and doing everything we can to understand the dynamics of the line and make good choices going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai, your line is open. Kai Pan : My first question is on personal auto. You have made great improvements in the margin side. Is that increased spending to show your confidence you fill your margin at the targeted levels, you want to grow top line a little bit faster? And will that spending, not just you but also some of your peers, as well as the potential say mandate lead to reductions post the tax reform, actually your growth on the margin improvement you have made? Chris Swift : We are feeling good about the progress we\u2019re making in personal lines auto. And yes, you see the impact of some of our leaning and on the marketing side, because our expense ratios are up in the quarter. So our loss improvement is greater than the aggregate, the sum total of the change in the line of auto. So feeling very good about that, still more work to be done, and we think we will improve our close ratios over the latter half of the year as our pricing moderates, because our rate adequacies are getting better and better by the month. So we finished 2017 with roughly two-thirds of our book in a very solid position relative to rate adequacy. And as we move to the next four quarters, we\u2019ll complete that journey and are going to feel very good. So you\u2019ll see more moderate rated rates in our pricing profile with Personal Lines auto and as such, I expect our new business levels to grow accordingly. Kai Pan : My second follow-up question, probably for Chris. Thank you so much, very clear on -- your capital management priorities. I just want to drill down a little more specific. With the closing of Talcott, is there some investor anxieties on potential large deal. Could you discuss under what circumstances you would use stock to do the acquisitions. What are some financial hurdles you will need for large deals versus small cash acquisitions? Chris Swift : I hope we have enough time to talk through it. But what I would share with you is as I said in my commentary, capital management is important you know our priorities as far as organic growth, M&A and then returning the deployable capital to shareholders. But as it relates to M&A, I would share with you couple of themes that we've talked about in the past. We tend to think in terms of more bolt-on activities or extensions into adjacent markets. We talked about premium levels in the billion dollars, maybe even up to $2 billion of premium that a target we would have. We have a good team. We have models that watch market activity. So I can tell you as we sit here today, we don't think about using stock in a transaction, because generally a lot of the things that we think about that could be actionable at some point in time in the future are probably less than the $4 billion range. So that tends to be our sweet spot. And as I said, we're patient about exploring opportunities. We\u2019re thoughtful about exploring opportunities. There is a lot of things that we see that -- just the numbers don't work the math can't work based on expectations of value. So all I could tell you is that we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful and disciplined about deploying capital to create shareholder value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, there has been some headlines about the NCCI pushing for basically price cuts within comp following on tax reform. How does that factor into your pricing and margin outlook on your comp business for this year also and as you think into 2019? Chris Swift : Elyse, as we shared last quarter, we largely see tax reform working its way through the P&L in \u201918. But over time we and others I'm sure are adjusting inside our pricing models for the new tax rates. And as such, as we go through filings, we\u2019ll appropriately make sure that we have the right tax rates in our filings as well. I look at the last three to four years of comp experience and I think of how favorable, basically the aggregate environment, has been for comp as a line. And I think that's the real fuel driving this loss cost trend that is dropping through these filings. So we have worked and continue to work hard on our claim confidences, our underwriting profile, understanding our segments, et cetera. But I wouldn\u2019t sit here today and suggest to you that there isn\u2019t downward pressure on pricing and workers comp, there is. I would say to you that when I think about it relative to our markets, we have a bit more flexibility at the risk level in middle. And so based on the characteristics of the risk, there is a bit more underwriter judgment involved. Clearly, our small commercial world is a bit more spot-rated. So there are a number of competing dynamics across, but the line in total had a good first quarter for us. We\u2019re watching our trends. But it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there is some compression in the line over the next latter half for the year into '19. Beth Bombara : And I think Doug the only thing I\u2019d add to that is you always start with the fact that overall we see workers compensation as a very profitable line for us. So even with some of that pressure, we\u2019re still very comfortable writing business in that line and growing in comp. Elyse Greenspan : And my second question, Chris in terms of your M&A comments, very thorough. You did say that you guys would -- depending upon the duo and what it could bring to, you will be willing to take on a small amount potentially of reinsurance exposure. Just wanted to clarify that comment. Would that mean small amount in terms of the pro forma fitness when you think about Hartford after a deal or do you mean you would consider a deal of acquiring something and the property that you would acquire would only have a small amount to bring insurance? Chris Swift : Elyse more of the latter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh, your line is open. Josh Shanker : Two questions that are in-related, I promise no follow up. First, the 10-Q used some materially different language to talk about buyback compared to the 10-K. The 10-K from February said that the Hartford does not expect to offer rising equity repurchase plan in 2018. While the 10-Q filed yesterday nearly said the company does not have an equity purchase plan yet in 2018. Have you changed your stance on 2018 buyback, which of course I think you should do. And secondly, there is a press and investors have commented that you appear to have been interested in XL. I\u2019m not going to ask about that. But also buyer of XL told everyone a year earlier that they are only interested in smaller bolt-on deals and large transactions would surprise the market. How much flexibility are you giving yourself in regard deviating from your self-imposed rules around acquisitions? Beth Bombara : I\u2019ll take the first question and then I\u2019ll leave the second question for Chris. But yes, the language that is in our 10-Q was an intentional change. And as Chris said, share repurchases can be an effective use of excess capital, sustain the fact that we do not have an authorization in place today, does lead open the possibility that we could have on authorization in place at some point in 2018. Josh Shanker : And second part about rules and flexibility. Chris Swift : I would say again here, as we sit here today, we are focusing on the bolt-on category. I can\u2019t predict what may or may not develop in the future. So as long as there is understanding about the strategic and the financial hurdles and discipline that we have with our shareholders, if we flex up in size in any way just know that we\u2019ll continue to have high bars for performance, high bars for our alignment on strategy. I can't for shadow a scenario right now where we would do something in that major transformational area. It\u2019s just there is not that much that's actionable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR. Randy, your line is open. Randy Binner : I wanted to ask about sales in the group, which were good and better than expected. And one of the risks of the integration with Aetna is losing shelf-space with distribution. So the question is how is that distribution, communication, and interaction process going? And is there a potential here for you not to have these premium lapse assumptions kick-in if sales continue to trend better than expected? Chris Swift : Randy, let me just -- I'll ask Doug to add his color. Again, the strategic logic of putting is to benefit business together has never been stronger or more confirmed with our activities over the last four or five months, whether it\u2019d be feedback from distributors, whether it\u2019d be using their claim system, whether it\u2019d being creating a team that is really motivated to lead the market and create new opportunities to serve customers. I think we got great alignment around the organization. I would also tell you that our distribution partners and what they share with us is that they have a high degree of confidence in our ability to integrate and continue to serve their existing customers. And Doug, I think you and I see that we're being shown a lot of new opportunities and maybe in the past a standalone Hartford would not have seen, but Randy that's my perspective. Doug, what would you share? Doug Elliot : Super sales quarter for us, and I would first comment that both the Hartford and Aetna had very strong sales quarter. So on a standalone basis would have had a terrific start to the year, but also Aetna likewise, particularly in the phase of what they're going through last year, had a good sales quarter. So you put the two together and we really start 2018 strong. Secondly, our pipeline has never been stronger. So we are active in working on proposals now. Obviously, there is a lot of activity around the latter half of \u201918 effective and \u201919 deal date. So Chris and I participate in many of them but our team upstairs is fully engaged; number one, on the sales side and new sales; and secondly, I think there was a piece of the end of your question about retention. So we're also working on our renewal strategy. And we were out in market with several renewal quotes on our 1119 national account jumbo deals as well. So we feel very good about it. I will be with the team in Colorado in a few weeks at EBLF engaging locally, I love what our sales and support teams are doing. We have lot of work in front of us but we feel really good about the last hundred days of progress. Randy Binner : And so I guess my follow-up on those comments, I guess I would characterize them as new product. So does this new platform position you to introduce new and different products into the group market, maybe move more toward supplemental, is that something that this might enable? Doug Elliot : There was a word at the end of one of my sentences in the script that I want to make sure, I highlight here. We\u2019re very pleased with our growing momentum in voluntary products. So we've worked hard to build out our voluntary suite and in 1119 had terrific success. And if you look in our stuff, you can you look at the other sales growth below disability and Group Lines, and see a little bit of that momentum. Now, it\u2019s small so we\u2019re just starting against $5 plus billion base, it's not something that is going to be huge any time soon. But the interest in that product, our ability to launch and service, the generation of new demand, we\u2019re very excited about. And I think it will be an opportunity across both books of business, including Aetna\u2019s. Chris Swift : Randy, just a simple fact is again we have 20 million customers in the book of business now. So what we\u2019ve talked about and as Doug referred to what we've been building patiently voluntary products additional A&H products, other services that we can bring to that product set, including lease management on a more integrated basis. All of that has been on our vision and we're really beginning to execute to it that I think will really accelerate our growth and our profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer, your line is open. Meyer Shields : Two quick questions, first obviously P&C results were very strong. But I\u2019m wondering whether you also saw some adverse impact from non-cat fee weather in the quarter? Doug Elliot : Our non-cat weather pretty consistent with prior trend, so we didn\u2019t have the same dynamic maybe others as spoken to, but there was clearly a lot of weather in the month of March and we looked across our footprint, we feel good about our cat calls but nothing that I would call out extraordinary right now. Meyer Shields : And then second bigger picture. Can you walk us through the strategy for getting the underlying combined ratio in specialty down? Is that an expense issue a sale issue? Doug Elliot : Largely it\u2019s a mix issue, Meyer, because our national account book is in that segment. The duration on our liabilities on our workers\u2019 comp excess product are in the 12 to 15 category. So that book is going to tend to run at very different combined rations than our normal middle and small. So it\u2019s all about mix. Our national account book is performing well, strong ROEs. I just think you have to keep in mind what's in the segment very different than the other markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay, your line is open. Jay Gelb : Couple of clarifying questions, first on M&A. I believe the range of premium volume mentioned was $1 billion to $2 billion. Would that be gross or net? Doug Elliot : Again, when we think about it and look at it, we think in terms of gross, because then we think of our own reinsurance strategies and appetite, Jay. Jay Gelb : And then I think it might be helpful just to understand Hartford\u2019s excess capital position given the net of announced acquisitions versus dispositions. How much excess capital does Hartford currently have adjusted for deals that are about to close? Beth Bombara : Jay, couple of things, when you look at holding company resources I think end of the quarter and we\u2019ve got about billion on resources there. I\u2019ll remind you we are planning on paying down $500 million of hybrids in June. We then have the net proceeds that will come in from the Talcott sale, which is about $1.7 billion as I said in my remarks, and that\u2019s in the short term. Again, when we did the acquisition of Aetna last year, we had talked about the fact that we expected lower dividends this year from our operating subsidiaries, so no dividends from the group business. So, really as we go into 2019, we'd expect to see dividends increasing again both from P&C and from Hartford Life & Accident, which is the group business. And then the other things you keep in mind is that we will be generating cash flows at the holding company as it relates to monetizing our tax assets. And we'll start to see some of that in \u201919 as we get refunds our AMT credits and then utilize those NOLs. So those are the sources that I think about over time if that\u2019s helpful. Jay Gelb : It is, but based on my probably simplistic knowledge of this. How does that all translate relative to what Hartford would typically desire to have in terms of holding company resources and what does that mean for us? Beth Bombara : So as it relates to our target as a holding company, we typically look to 1 to 1.5 times interest and dividend requirements. But we also want to maintain flexibility, so as we have in the past, we\u2019ve used our excess capital ratably over a period. So those are parameters that we think about. But again, as Chris said, we do want to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet and any capital that we would deploy, we would look at doing that over a period of time. Jay Gelb : And is there a tie into that in terms of when the decision may be made whether to resume share buybacks? Chris Swift : Jay, I would decouple some things in terms that there's no bright line or date on the calendar to say, these are what we're trying to make decisions on. Some of it obviously as it relates to M&A is the fluidity of the marketplace and the dynamics there. We want to be able to react to opportunities that make strategic and financial sense. But we also realized that we\u2019re not going to be able to and should not hold excess capital forever. So I think what Beth was describing is that we are going to build a healthy position of deployable capital. We\u2019ll continue to be aware of marketplace opportunities. But at some point in time, we would have to begin a return program in the form of either increase dividends or buybacks. Operator : Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. YaronKinar: So one maybe net picky question with regards to commercial, so I think you've highlighted record new business growth in small commercial. We've also achieved our more significant rate increases than in middle market and yet net premiums in small commercial have actually slowed, which I\u2019m thinking I mean that maybe there is maybe some erosion retention levels in that business. So would that mean that there is increased shopping behavior among customers as we push through and that there is still abundant capacity willing to offer lower or maybe even unattractive rates in order to one business out there in the market? Chris Swift : Yaron, I don't feel that. I feel two factors relative to the core of your question. One is that we've been rather aggressive on our auto re-pricing and re-underwriting. And so our auto retentions are down significantly and that's definitely causing a bit of a drag on our overall top line and small. And then the second thing is that although we\u2019re positive on the pricing side for comp, we\u2019re slightly positive. And so we\u2019re not getting any significant lift on a good segment of our small commercial book and our comp pricing. So all in, I am more focused around the auto book that we\u2019ve taken action that we think we needed to take to correct that. I see the progress in our loss ratios that\u2019s why we're continuing to post terrific numbers there. I don\u2019t feel a lot difference in the marketplace yet. YaronKinar: And then the second question I have is with regard to the group benefits business. And I apologize if I missed that. But when you talk about the group disability improved incidents trends and better recoveries. Is that across both the legacy Hartford business and the new Aetna block, or is it coming more from one than the other? Chris Swift : Both disability books, Yaron, and our exhibiting solid behavior. So we feel good on both disability sides. Sabra Purtill : Amy, we have time for one more question I think. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Two very quick questions, number one going back to the discussion on consolidation. Would your answer on the business mix as it relates to reinsurance, would that have been different if the tax cut act would not have been passed and implemented? Chris Swift : I don\u2019t think so. I mean, think in terms of strategies first and alignment of businesses you want to be, and then the finance and the math has to work, but the pre and post tax reform, we wouldn\u2019t have had a different view. Amit Kumar : Because I was wondering about the re-domicile aspect that\u2019s where I was going with the question. The second question, I guess the final question I have is again going back to the comp numbers. If I look at the Schedule P and compare the Hartford Scheduled P with the industry Schedule P, and if you look at the development of loss specs, why has the development being lower. I guess why have you taken down the loss specs on lower basis versus the industry? Is there something in the book or is it just conservatism here versus the industry trends? Beth Bombara : As we said before as we think about our comp book and the long tailed nature of that, we\u2019re very thoughtful about some of the trends that we build into reserves, specifically around severity and medical cost severity. So we have seen, over the last few years, very favorable trend there but we really think about it more for the long-term. And so as we evaluate our reserves each quarter, we look at how things are developing and take action accordingly. But we\u2019re not prepared to take down our long-term view of those trends or those factors that affect the reserves. Chris Swift : And we have made some slight adjustments, Beth, but we\u2019ve reacted candidly more to the frequency side over the last couple of years, because we now feel like we\u2019ve got a pretty solid look at those last couple of action years, particularly '15 and '16. So Amit, thanks for the question. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to follow-up with the Investor Relations team. Thank you for joining us today and have a good weekend. Operator : This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Chris Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Second quarter marked another strong performance for The Hartford. Core earnings were up 36%, core earnings per share rose 40% and book value per share excluding AOCI was up 8% since year end 2017. Our annualized core earnings ROE for the first half of 2018 was 13%. Earnings growth came from Commercial Line, Group Benefits and mutual funds including the lower effective tax rate. Personal Lines underlying margins continue to improve, but were outweighed on the bottom line by higher catastrophe losses. Despite higher cat losses in the first half, we remain on track to achieve our underlying margin and profitability outlook for the full year. During the quarter we achieved progress on several other important goals. First, we closed the sale of Talcott on May 31 just eight weeks ago. Net cash considerations of the holding company was about $1.5 billion. In addition, we retained a 9.7% equity stake in Talcott, which is carried on our books at $164 million at June 30. Second, the Aetna Group Benefits integration, about eight months underway is proceeding well. Given the complexity of the numerous activities involved, I am very pleased and impressed with the pace and overall progress. We are optimistic that we can reduce expenses by more than our original $100 million target. Beside from the integration, Group Benefits sales are off to a strong start in 2018. First half sales totaled $539 million, almost double from last year. This includes $7 million of life and disability product sales to Aetna Group Medical Customers. These sales are the result of our agreement with their major medical sales force to work with us and continue to market Group Life disability products to their customers. These results speak to the success of our cross sale partnership. We are also executing on a project across the company that are making The Hartford a customer centric and easier company to do business with. It's a long list with an emphasis on technology in digital tools, working in an agile environment. One example is in Small Commercial. On our ICON platform we have increased the percent of accounts that can be quoted on the glass. We have streamlined the underwriting process and reduced the time it takes to get a quote, which is an important competitive advantage in this market. Another example is the expansion of our underwriting capabilities in Specialty Product Orientation to achieve our goal of being a broader and deeper risk player. In middle market, we have grown in added industry verticals, responding to increasing demands from agents for deeper industry under writing expertise with a broader product suite. This aligns with our strategy to expand account rounding with our workers compensation policy holders, who value our claims and customer service capabilities. Examples of our focus on industry verticals include technology, a traditional strength at The Hartford, which grew premium 4.5% over the last two years. In addition, our construction practice has grown premiums 35% over the past four years. Lastly, we entered the energy market late 2016 and over the past four quarters wrote $24 million in gross written premium. These are just a few examples of our approach to organic business development. Taken all together, we sustain very good momentum this quarter in all our businesses. I am thrilled with our progress and our future potential. Last week we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This decision was based on the strong performance of our businesses, the sale of Talcott and lower tax rates, consistent with our longstanding dividend philosophy. Last week's dividend declaration was the sixth consecutive annual increase and it will increase our dividend yield and payout ratio to be more in line with peers. With regard to other uses of excess capital, our philosophy has not changed. Investing in our company remains the cornerstone of our strategy. We want to achieve profitable organic growth, particularly where we have attractive returns and strong competitive advantages. Along those lines, acquisitions that are aligned with our long term strategic and financial goals are a compelling use of capital. Acquisitions can help build greater competitive advantages, add operational capabilities and accelerate earnings growth, compared with building a business from the ground up. For example, in 2016 we acquired Maxum, which allow Small Commercial to expand into the E&S market. In 2017 we purchased the Aetna's U. S. Group Life and Disability book, which was a unique opportunity to expand our market position while acquiring an industry leading claims and leave management platform. As I shared last quarter, when we assess areas of our business that could benefit from the accelerance of an acquisition, we have a focus on specialty lines and industry verticals in the Commercial Insurance segment that would expand our product sets in underwriting expertise. Since the recent sale of Talcott, there has been speculation and questions about future share repurchase plans. This is understandable as our prior capital management actions have included a large amount of debt reduction and share repurchases. While capital management remains a valid alternative, it is not our primary focus at this time. Therefore we have not authorized a new share repurchase plan. We will continue to evaluate options that will generate long term earnings growth at good returns. And if we conclude that there is not an alternative option to support growth, a share buyback plan could be put into place relatively quickly. But as I've stated previously, we will be thoughtful and patient regarding capital deployment with our focus on creating long term sustainable shareholder value, which is why we are maintaining the option of investing capital to expand the business. To wrap up my comments, The Hartford had very strong performance for the first half of the year, both financially and operationally. We are intently focused on continuing to execute on our goals and sustain our momentum through the second half of the year. I look forward to updating you on our progress over the balance of the year. Now I'll turn the call over the Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. This was another strong quarter in property and casualty and Group Benefits as we advance our key business initiatives and address evolving market conditions. Commercial Lines had a strong quarter as we continue to balance growth with competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines improved auto trends continues, although overall results were hampered by catastrophe losses, and in Group Benefits we had another excellent quarter with strong favorable trends in Group Disability. Before I touch on second quarter results for each business segment, let me cover current and prior year catastrophe losses for property and casually. In the quarter we had $188 million of current year cat losses, $33 million higher than a year ago, driven by significant wind and hail storms in various regions across the country. Included in prior year development is the reduction of our estimates for prior year catastrophes, largely attributable to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of lowering these estimates, we no longer expect to receive a recovery against our aggregate catastrophe reinsurance treaty for the 2017 accident year. The benefit from the aggregate treaty was allocated to each business unit based on our estimate of ultimate losses for the full year. This quarter as you can see on page 13 of the slides, 2017 gross loss estimates decreased in both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines, causing total P&C losses to fall below the attachment point for the treaty. However, the decrease in gross losses was greater in Commercial Lines than Personal Lines, and therefore unwinding the aggregate cover resulted in net adverse developments for Personal Lines. Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. In Commercial Lines the combined ratio improved 4.5 points from prior year to 90.1, driven by a favorable prior year development, partially offset by slightly higher current year catastrophe losses and expenses. The prior year development was primarily due to continued favorable trends in workers compensation and lower estimates on catastrophe reserves as I just covered, partially offset by an increase in reserves for higher hazard General Liability exposures. This portion of our General Liability book remains profitable, but we are responding to an increase in loss trends in accident years 2015 through 2017. Trends in the remainder of our General Liability book have been slightly better than our expectations. The underlying combined ratio of Commercial Lines which excludes catastrophes and prior year development was 90, improving nine tenths of a point from last year. The improvement was largely driven by favorable loss trends, particularly non cat property as well as General Liability. This is offset by higher expenses and slight margin compression in workers compensation. Let me provide a few additional thoughts on workers compensation, touching on three important factors; frequency, severity and rates. First on frequency : In both Small Commercial and middle market, our frequency has been trending slightly higher during 2018. We see this as a broad based economic driven trend across many states and industry classes. Keep in mind that absolute frequency is still at historical low levels and margins remain attractive. However expanding participation in the labor market often means less experienced workers are on the job but driver of frequency. Second on severity : We continue to closely watch inflation trends for upward pressure on both wages and medical cost drivers of severity. Although accident year 2018 data is immature at point in the year, severity remains within our expectations. And third on rates : Loss cost in workers compensation have been quite benign for several years and as a result the NCCI and other bureaus have been filing negative loss cost changes in many jurisdictions. Industry rate filings are based on these loss cost trends and have put downward pressure on rates in 2018 and will likely do so in 2019. Combining these three factors we continue to expect some margin compression in our small commercial and middle market books of business. Since each of these businesses has unique market dynamics for pricing and growth, our approach to successfully managing these rate changes is also dynamic. In middle market and national accounts greater weight is placed on individual risk characteristics when pricing the account. In small commercial, pricing is more heavily weighted to class factors making book management a critical tool. Over the last five years we have significantly advanced our actuarial analytics and data science capabilities to improve our ability to identify these trends and respond confidently with pricing, underwriting and claims management initiatives. Given our strong margins and organizational capabilities, we will continue to execute a disciplined pricing and book of business management strategy in the months ahead. Moving to pricing in the quarter, I'm very pleased that our renewal written pricing and standard Commercial Lines was 3.1%, up from 2.4% in the first quarter of the year. As I suggested in my comments last quarter, we saw a positive movement in middle market across Property, General Liability and Workers Compensation with strong increases continuing to come from Commercial Auto. Our pricing and standard Commercial Lines excluding Workers Compensation was 5.2 in the quarter. Looking at our Commercial Lines business units, small commercial had another strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 85.6. Written premium was off slightly, the result of downward pressure on workers compensation rates and competitive market conditions for both new business and renewals. The margin improvement versus last year was driven by non-cat property, General Liability and Auto, partially offset by higher expenses. In middle market the underlying combined ratio of 94.1 improved eight-tenths of a point from 2017, mainly due to non-cat property and General Liability. This was partially offset by a modest margin compression in workers compensation and higher expenses. Written premium was up 3% over last year with new business production of $138 million. And in Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.5 deteriorated 2.6 points. This was driven mainly by higher expenses and margin compression in national accounts and financial products. Written premium was up 9% for the quarter reflecting strong growth in bond and financial products. Moving to Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 90.4 improved 2.2 points from a year ago, driven primarily by improvement in Auto and to a lesser degree better home-owners performance. The underlying combined ratio in Personal Auto improved 2.6 points to 96.5. We continue to experience relatively stable loss cost trends and we are satisfied with our bottom line performance. Personal Lines premium was down 7%. Consistent with my comments in recent quarters, our marketing spend continues to accelerate and we are focused on driving new business growth. In AARP Direct auto, our bellwether line, new business was up 19% in the quarter. This is an encouraging result as we focus on growth through new business and improved retention. We're implementing additional product and process changes throughout the remainder of the year that I expect will continue to improve our top line trends. Turning the Group Benefits we had another excellent quarter, with core earnings of $104 million and a margin of 6.9%. Drivers were similar to last quarter, including favorable disability results, lower tax rates and the contribution from our 2017 acquisition, partially offset by slightly higher life mortality. Persistency on our employer group block of business remains strong at approximately 90% and fully insured ongoing sales of $85 million were up from prior year. This was a solid sales quarter and we're pleased with our traction in the market. Our integration of the Aetna Group Life and Disability business remains on track and is picking up momentum. We began converting small case business to our current platform this month and we will ramp up those efforts throughout the year. The new disability claim platform now branded The Hartford Ability Advantage is expected to come online for new cases effective in 2019. As Chris noted in his comments, our expense reduction efforts are on track and as our business conversion process continues in \u201819 and \u201920, we are confident that we will be able to exceed our original savings target. In summary, this was another strong quarter for our property and casually and Group Benefits businesses. At the halfway point for 2018, I'm please with our execution and our performance. We are responding to loss cost trends with appropriate pricing action and disciplined underwriting. We continue to innovate in all areas of our business to deliver a superior customer experience, and we're committed to becoming a more relevant partner for our agents and brokers, with an expanded product portfolio to better meet customer needs and deliver profitable growth to The Hartford. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. My comments today will cover second quarter results for the investment portfolio, mutual funds and corporate, impacts on the quarter from the sale of Talcott and June 30 book value and debt leverage before taking your questions. Starting with investments, net investment income performance and yields remain steady. Per-tax limited partnership investment income was flat with the prior year at $39 million or an annualized return of 9.5% in second quarter 2018. Excluding LP's, the annualized portfolio yield before tax was 3.7%, down slightly from 3.8% in second quarter 2017 due to the impact of the Group Benefits acquisition. The P&C yield was flat year-over-year at 3.8%. Consistent with the first quarter, the yield on the consolidated Group Benefits investment portfolio is lower than last year, because acquisition accounting rules require that the acquired portfolio is mark-to-market. As a result, the annualized yield before tax, excluding LP's in Group Benefits was 4.3% in the third quarter 2017 before the acquisition, but dropped to 3.7% in the fourth quarter. This quarter the Group Benefits annualized portfolio yield was 3.9%, up slightly from first quarter 2018. This is the result of our reinvestment of the acquired portfolio towards our target sector allocation, with less municipal bond exposure resulting in a higher pre-tax yields. Investment credit performance remained excellent this quarter with no net impairments due to a generally benign credit environment and the credit strength and diversification of our portfolio. Turning to mutual funds, second quarter core earnings were $38 million, up 58% from last year, due to the combination of lower tax rate and higher AUM from positive net flows and higher market values. Income before taxes rose 21% as a result of the operating leverage in our operations, with a 6% increase in revenues, but only a 3% increase in expenses. AUM growth is due to net flows which totaled $1.9 billion over the last four quarters and changes in market value which totaled $8.2 billion. Our ETP business drove $500 million of net flows over the last four quarters. Hartford fund\u2019s strong performance is driving the positive net flows with 61% and 66% of funds beating their peers on a three year and five year basis respectfully. Corporate core losses totaled $76 million, higher than first quarter 2018, due principally to a tax chew up for the reallocation from the business segments to corporate for the impact of non-deductible executive compensation. Income from discontinued operations was $148 million, up from $112 million in the second quarter of 2017. In the second quarter 2017 this represented Talcott\u2019s net income for the quarter. In contrast, in this quarter about 90% of the income reflected an increase in our estimate of the retained tax benefits from Talcott, due to a change in our estimate of Talcott\u2019s tax basis. This change increases our estimate of the value of retained tax benefits to about $830 million. Going forward, other revenue will include the return on our investment in Talcott, which will be included in core earnings and in the corporate segment, along with other Talcott impacts. The other impacts include beginning this quarter, income from investment management and transition services, as well as the related operating expenses. The amounts recorded this quarter reflect one month of activity and do not have a significant impact on the corporate bottom line. We expect transition services and stranded costs to decrease over the next 12 to 18 months. In total, The Hartford second quarter core earnings were $412 million, up from $303 million in second quarter 2017 due to higher commercial lines of group benefits and mutual funds earnings before tax, as well as a lower federal income tax rate. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 19% in the quarter compared with 18% in the first quarter of 2018, due to a slightly higher proportion of income from underwriting results and taxable investment income, as all income other than municipal bonds interest is taxed at 21%. Book value per diluted share at June 30, 2018 was $34.44, a 7% decrease from December 31, 2017. The after tax unrealized gain on our fixed maturity portfolio at June 30, 2018 was $211 million, down from $1.8 billion at December 31. This decrease was due to the Talcott sale and the reduction in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio due to higher rates and wider credit spreads. Book value per share excluding AOCI with $38.15, an increase of 8% from December 31, 2017, reflecting the increase in retained earnings as a result of net income in excess of dividends for the first six months of the year. The core earnings ROE was 8.4%, calculated using rolling four quarter earnings and average stockholders\u2019 equity since June 30, 2017. On an annualized year-to-date basis, core earnings ROE was 13%, which is above our outlook for the year. Turning to our debt leverage, in June we called at par $500 million in junior subordinated debt, reducing our total debt outstanding by $323 million since year end 2017. Despite the repayment of debt and strong earnings, our rating agency debt to total capital ratio of about 30% was flat with March 31 due to the inclusion of AOCI in this calculation. Over the long term our focus is to reduce the rating agency adjusted debt to total capital ratio to the low to mid 20\u2019s. However, since it includes the favorable or unfavorable impact of AOCI, this ratio can be volatile during periods of changing interest rate. So we also focus on the total leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing total debt, including hybrid the then preferred at par, by total debt and capital excluding AOCI. At June 30 our total leverage ratio was 25%, which is still at the high end of our long term goal. We continue to focus on decreasing this ratio over time. To conclude, we remain a very good path and 2018 with strong underwriting and investment results and success in both closing the sale of Talcott and the continued integration of the group manifest acquisition. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Dan, could you please repeat the Q&A instructions? Thank you. Operator : Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Your first question today will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ElyseGreenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, in terms of the commercial lines margin, pretty strong improvement this quarter. I was hoping we can get a little bit more color; if you can break down you know how much you saw coming from you know favorable non-cat property, also from liability and then also from the Auto, the three things you called out in the press release. If you can just give us a sense of the contribution from each. And then there\u2019s a 90 basis points of improvement just based off of how you see the rating environment and what's going on in comm. Is that the right level we should think about in commercial going forward? DougElliot: Elyse, good morning. This is Doug. Let me try to tackle both of them separately. When I look across our markets, as I mentioned both Small and Middle had excellent non-cat property quarters, and Small about a point better quarter-to-quarter and Middle a couple of points, 2.5 points better, so significant drivers of positive performance. Small on the workers comp side about our expectations and I mentioned that just slightly we made an adjustment to our workers comp in Middle, about a Small amount. So when I look across, I feel good about all the non-compliance in the middle. We made an adjustment in comp and all in, a very, very solid quarter for commercialized relative to combined ratios. Can you repeat the other question a little bit more? ElyseGreenspan: Yeah, well I guess I was just trying to think about you know going forward, is kind of the 90 basis points of underlying margin improvement you saw in commercial lines this quarter, is that the right level we should be thinking about or maybe adjust a little bit just for the favorable non-cat whether in the quarter? ChrisSwift: Well, first off I think the improvement of 90 basis points was a terrific quarter and so I love to think we could outperform like that going forward, but that is \u2013 that will take experience and the next couple of months for us to be able to determine that. I am suggesting that we're seeing a little bit of turn in our frequency in the worker's comp line. So we expect to see some compression there, because rates are moving in one direction and frequency is moving in the other. So we're watching carefully what that means for our book of business and we\u2019ll take appropriate actions going forward. But as you know there are headwinds on the pricing side in workers comp, because those loss cost trends over the last several years are so favorable that they are dropping in state by state to the pricing algorithms and so we're making adjustments as appropriate there. So I feel great about our improvement in the quarter. I love to think we could continue with that, but that\u2019s going to take some time for us to show that and through the P&L. ElyseGreenspan: Okay, great. And then on the capital side, I you know appreciate the disclosure about how you guys you know are now valuating you know M&A as well as capital return. I guess I also was wondering how you guys also think about managing down your leverage you know pro forma for the debt maturity that comes due early next year. Your leverage is probably still running you know in the high 20\u2019s. So how does you know managing down your leverage you know balance against if you end up with excess capital and how you're thinking about potential for buy backs? BethBombara: Yeah, you know great question. So as we talked about before, we do you have maturing debt as you pointed out at the beginning of 2019, which our current intention would be to pay that down and we look at that combined with just the earnings power of our businesses. We believe that puts us on a very good track as we think about managing that ratio down. So I think we've done a good job you know in the past of using maturing debt, the opportunity for that without having to pay a large premium to reduce our debt outstanding and say just, we\u2019ll continue on that path. ElyseGreenspan: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead. TomGallagher: Good morning. First question Chris; just on that capital management commentary you made, does the priority of M&A over buy backs suggest that you'll see current attractive opportunities in M&A or is that more of the medium term comment that you'll patiently look for opportunities and like to build a bigger capital position while you wait for those opportunities. ChrisSwift: Yeah, thanks Tom. Again, we were just talking about things that we've talked about before. So I would say it again. From the building the business, investing in our business, looking at acquisition opportunities, I mean that's been our consistent philosophy for a number of years now. So I'm not signaling any change you know one way or other. It's just sort of our playbook of priorities that we would go down on exploring. So I said in my prepared remarks, if we can't find a good use for our excess capital, we are more than comfortable in returning it to shareholders. TomGallagher: Got you. So really no change is contestant with you know getting maybe to a bigger level of access before you consider using it for alternatives like buy backs? ChrisSwift: Yeah, I'm not going to try to sort of size the level of capital here. I mean we just closed Talcott. We've gotten excess capital. You've heard Beth just comment about what we want to do with debt. We\u2019re comfortable where we are right now in giving ourselves a little time. I mean it's not -- we're not looking for years and years and years here. We just want you know the option and the flexibility to explore, using our capital to invest in businesses and/or new revenue streams. TomGallagher: Got it. And then just a question on Group Benefits. From the disclosure in your Q, it looks like you had another good quarter of very favorable prior year development. By our estimate it\u2019s more than half of the earnings for that segment. Now you've been having that favorable development for several years now, so it doesn't appear to be a one-timer; it seems pretty sustainable. So my question is, should we think about most of that development being recent in accident year releases or is a lot of that coming from recoveries of older accident years. Can you provide some perspective on how that -- where that's coming from and then maybe the sustainability of it? BethBombara: Yeah sure, I'll take that. So again on the group side and specifically on the disability side as we look at our trends, you know we have been seeing favorable trends, you know more so in the more recent years as those exposures develop. You know I think in the disability block it's important to remember that you know there\u2019s a lag sort of in the timing of when someone goes on disability and then when they actually end up on long term disability. So we peg those lines and then looked at how the development comes in overtime. And our incidence rates and our recoveries on all those fronts have been very favorable. It\u2019s hard to predict obviously going forward, but we're very happy with the trends that we've been seeing you know as we kind of go into the second half of this year. TomGallagher: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. JoshShanker: Hi there. I don't know if I'm going to get a better answer than the prepared remarks, but you talked about being more confident about the cost savings associated with the other transaction. You were formerly at $100 million. I look at about $400 million of run rate expenses coming with Aetna. Can you sort of break out what\u2019s in that 400 and why we couldn't expect half of it to go down or how we should think about that? ChrisSwift: Josh, I\u2019ll just provide an opening commentary and then we could add additional color. As I said you know, in essence eight, nine months since the integration we feel very good about the integration, both from an operational side or go-to-market sales force side, customer retention side and all we\u2019re signaling right now is that our nine month indication is that we most likely will outperform our $100 million target over a longer period of time. If you remember why we say a longer period of time is you know we're timing the conversion of a lot of these policies and books of business from Aetna paper to our paper over a two year period of time, so that we don't disrupt that customer base that we just completed installing their claim system and our technology and our hardware here. So the real conversion process just begins. So it is a little longer term than maybe a typical integration activity, given we're dealing with three year rate policy, three year rate guarantees and you know moving the entire administration platform into our network and our capabilities right now. But I\u2019d love to \u2013 yeah Doug if you want to provide any additional commentary Doug. DougElliot: I think Chris that's a really good baseline. You know Josh, the number I have in my head for the Aetna baseline on cost is roughly 3.30. So when I think about 100 or 100-plus pretty significant change. In addition to what Chris said relative to us moving accounts, we are being very careful, trying not to disturb relationships of account managers and account executives on key Aetna renewals. So this is a multiyear process that I think we are very pleased about the initial nine months, but it is a several year effort and as we move through that period of time, I know we are going to find opportunities to be more effective and efficient in operations and we\u2019ll capitalize on those. JoshShanker: And you know look there is always the numbers. You gave a good detail on what's going on in workers comp. You took down reserves there, but you took up your axe and your pick and then on GL you added to reserve and took down your axe and your pick. I\u2019m just sort of wondering how past information is different from what you're doing on the current accident year? ChrisSwift: Yes, really good questions. So let me attack both comp and GL separately. When we think about our comp book of business and our reserves that we currently carry, we feel very good about the adequacy of our reserves. And in fact this quarter we did release some of those prior year reserves, primarily accident years \u201914 and \u201915, but our position on the balance is very solid and we feel good about that. When we are talking about accident year \u201818 we're starting to see some headwinds and we're looking at frequency which is a leading indicator and so we made an adjustment in middle market. But you know we're connecting the dots through the accident years and I just want to point out there's a difference in what we're caring and what we\u2019re seeing today. So that's really what's happening in the comp world. In the General Liability world, are normal GL book is performing according to our expectations. What we did in the quarter, we have a specialized, high hazard, heavy products group in middle market and that is the book that we saw some increase in both frequency and severity in all of our accident years. So we took action to strengthen those years, those are high hazard books and I want to differentiate that from what we're seeing in our normal go forward GL book and there we continue to watch but feel pretty good about current conditions. JoshShanker: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes in from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. JayCohen: Jay Cohen here. A couple of questions. First is the commercial issuance expense ratio that did tick-up. I understand on the Personal Lines side you are spending more from a marketing standpoint. What's driving the higher expense ratio in the commercial side? ChrisSwift: Jay, I\u2019m looking at Doug, he\u2019ll add his commentary, but I would just say we continue to invest in our infrastructure technology and digital experience for the customer. So yeah, it is elevated from trends over the years, but again it's a conscious part of our strategy. I would say particularly from the Commercial Lines, capability side we are probably 60%, 70% through of some of the core systems that we want to replace and I would say there are always true-ups from quarter-to-quarter on commissions, whether in essence be profit sharing or anything else you know commission wise. So Doug, that\u2019s what I would say, but what would you add? DougElliot: Yeah, that\u2019s a large piece and there is a little bit of compensation in there Chris as well. So as we look at plans and we look at performance through six months, just some true-ups that we normal do. But IT is a driver and our continued to invest inside our businesses. JayCohen: Got it, makes sense. The other question on M&A, without issuing stock and given your leverage, can you give us a sense of how big a deal in dollars you could do at this point? ChrisSwift: At this point and really Jay I\u2019m going to sort of probably disappoint you a little bit and refrain really for a lot of speculation here, because it\u2019s just don\u2019t do anyone any good. But I think the metrics that we talked about in the past, really are in the premium range, sort of a $2 billion premium company is still accurate as a target, as a bolt-on. So that\u2019s what we define. So that\u2019s why I would just say right now is that we are still in that bolt-on category and that\u2019s what I would leave you with. JayCohen: And that\u2019s helpful Chris. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. BrianMeredith: Yeah thanks, so a couple of questions here. Chris just quickly back on the whole M&A thing, can you remind us how you think about kind of GAAP earnings accretion and when you kind of balance M&A versus share buyback. ChrisSwift: Yeah, happy to Brian. And again we tried to address it in an early on question and its part of the equation. On the metrics on timeframes, payback periods, IRR\u2019s, returns on tangible, intangible capital. So we look at it all and I\u2019m not going to tell you there is a hard and fast rule, but we do want to earn acceptable returns as we always define it above our cost of equity capital in a relatively near term and we define that term somewhere in that three to four year period of time. So that\u2019s what I would say right now. BrianMeredith: Great, thanks for that. And then Doug I\u2019m just curious, looking at your Small Commercial business, policy account retention has continued to kind of slip through the last call it year and a half, call it two years. What\u2019s going on there and what are you doing to maybe improve that policy account retention? DougElliot: Brian we\u2019re certainly focused on both the retention and the new. You know there\u2019s a little bit of pressure in the micro space. I think we\u2019ve seen more entrance in the micro and the small, but there isn't anything material that I would point out that is worthy of spending a lot more time on this morning. You know overall we've been very steady growers of this business organically over the past five years. I know in the quarter we are a little off. There's a worker\u2019s comp dynamic to it, there's competition to it, but we're being thoughtful about this business. We continue to innovate. Some of the innovations that we\u2019re dropping into our platform, I do expect will show progress and growth in future quarters. So I don't look at this as the full trend for the next couple of quarters, but I do remind you that workers comp is an important part of our Small Commercial platform and therefore we're going to be in a different pricing environment over the next couple of quarters than what we've seen in the prior, probably two or three years. ChrisSwift: Hey Brian, I would also add to some of that trend that you are talking about policy counts and retentions influenced by the Commercial Auto environment broadly. So I mean there's been a little bit of -- my words would be pruning of mono line Commercial Auto. So that's affecting those trends a little bit and as you know that market is still not at adequate return, so we've been very thoughtful about putting additional premiums in that line of business. BrianMeredith: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. GaryRansom: Good morning, I was going to ask for a little more detail on underlying loss trends. You did give us a little bit of a picture on workers comp and high hazard liability lines. But I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the entire array of what you're seeing? I mean is workers\u2019 comp a good end of the lost trends still relatively benign and then what's at the worse end from your perspective? Is it Commercial Auto or is it some other liability line? ChrisSwift: Good morning Gary. I would say that you know the reason I made mention of workers comp is we do have full attention on this frequency dynamic. As I think across the rest of the lines in commercial, yeah we had a little spike in our high hazard GL in our prior book, but generally all of our other lines are still in a relatively benign, low single digits, lost trend environment. So, I don't think a lot has changed as we looked at the quarter and are loss performance relative to trends and I spoke about the line that we saw some degree of change in workers\u2019 comp. GaryRansom: So there's a lot of talk about inflation, not just you, but other companies as well, and yet it doesn't really seem to be showing up in the numbers, everyone's concerned about it but it's not quite there yet. Is that something you're able to respond to realistically if you have the concern of inflation? Can you raise rates in Small Commercial or is that part of what\u2019s competitive activity is not allowing you to do that? ChrisSwift: Well I shared our ex-comp pricing in the quarter at five plus and feel very good about that and I feel good about the Small Commercial component of that and the middle market. So we've been working at not only comp, but the other elements of our book-of-business from a pricing perspective over time and I think our performance demonstrates the progress of that pricing. Yes, it is a competitive marketplace, but the quarter we just punched, I feel really good about it. I think in terms of absolute performance, a very strong quarter Gary and I would say we've been able to price for what we've seen in the marketplace relative to the trend successfully over the last couple years. GaryRansom: No doubt today was a great day, but I'm always thinking about tomorrow and what comes next. ChrisSwift: I know, so are we. GaryRansom: But I thank you very much. ChrisSwift: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. RyanTunis: Hey thanks. Just a couple, I guess follow-ups on workers comp for Doug. I guess just what I was thinking about the commentary on accident year margin pressure on workers comp being a function of few things. It is safe to say though it\u2019s still mostly the fact that pricing decision is good, that\u2019s probably the biggest reason why you are talking about the margin headwinds there? DougElliot: What I would say that in \u201918, the biggest reason is really two fold; one is, yes we are watching these lost cost drop in and we're dealing with the state by state dynamics of where our loss experiences and what to do about our multiplier in these various states, so that\u2019s point A. Point B is that we've got a bit of an inflection on frequency that we\u2019re watching very carefully. So two quarters don't make a full trend, but we've had a couple of quarters now of positive frequency and that's the first time we've seen that in several years. So there is full attention on what our own book of business is telling us relative to signals and frequency. As I mentioned the severities, signals look well within our expectations, so we're watching severity both medical and indemnity, but I feel pretty good about that. Just looking at the combination of both pricing and frequency, we are very focused on choices and options in front of us relative to workers compensation. RyanTunis: Got it, and so you have seen a couple of quarters of positive frequency, should I take that to mean that I guess you are assuming in your new loss picks that there is positive frequency in workers comp? DougElliot: So I don't want to spend too much time talking about reserving process, but in general we're looking at earned patterns. We use historical and we bring in current year, both severity and frequency as appropriate. So the reason we adjusted middleis that we're trying to make sure we're recognizing what we're seeing in our patterns in the first to accident quarters of 2018 and in the middle we're seeing a pickup greater than we expected, which is why we adjusted our reserves. We\u2019ll have to continue to assess what third quarter and fourth quarter bring, but at the moment we made adjustments based on everything we could see in our book of business to make sure we closed up second quarter where we should have been from a loss ratio perspective. RyanTunis: Got it. And then I guess a last one I had was just thinking about some of the favorable results and the other casualty lies this quarter like General Liability Commercial Auto. I remember you guys adding the reserves in those areas and I think on \u201914, \u201915 at one point that was sort of a headwind. Is there reason those results are getting better because you are finding out now that similar things that you saw back then didn\u2019t end up being quite as negative or is there something else driving that? DougElliot: Yeah, probably lots of things driving that. I think our behavior and our discipline in the marketplace starts that discussion. I think we've become a very solid thoughtful underwriter using you know both skill sets at desk level and also data analytics, so I started there. Secondly, I think with Beth and Chris over the last seven, eight years we worked hard to be discipline on a reserving to bring forward, to the more current as we're looking at data. So I think our entire reserving process is much stronger today than it was over the last 10 years. Putting all that together, we're also trying to be very consistent in our approach quarter-to-quarter and the reflections of all those behaviors I think lead us to feel much better about our balance sheet today than we probably did seven years ago. RyanTunis: Perfect, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Please go ahead. IanGutterman: Hi, thank you. Chris, can we start out, just if I recall from the Q we have $2.3 billion at the holdco now. Can we just walk through what's left to kind of source activities in the second half versus the first? I know it\u2019s up for the year, but I don\u2019t know what's been taken already versus what's left to come. BethBombara: Sure. So again I'll remind you that with some of the actions that we did at the end of last year with the Aetna acquisition, that really decreased our dividend capacity for 2018. So we are not expecting dividend from P&C or Group Benefits in the second half of this year. We would expect to see a modest amount from mutual funds, but for the most part there is not additional dividend coming in from the subsidiaries in the second half of this year. And for P&C, because some of the Talcott proceeds actually went through various legal entities to get to the holding company, our dividend capacity for ordinary dividends in P&C really probably for the most part won't be there until the second half of 2019. IanGutterman: Got it, and then do we have any tax sharing payments coming in second half or those all come in the first half? BethBombara: Yeah, so a little bit, I mean obviously that would be dependent upon actual taxable income forecast for the second half of the year, but based on our current estimates, I\u2019d anticipate probably another you know $150 million maybe will come in the second half of \u201818 to the holding company. Again, that can bounce around just based on actual results. And then we\u2019ve also in the past highlighted the fact that we will, we do anticipate a refund coming in \u201819 for our AMT credits and that will come in when we file our tax return which you know could be as late as September of 2019. IanGutterman: I was going to as ask about that one too. So if I take the tax sharing minus the corporate dividends, would suggest you end the year somewhere around the 2.3 you're at right now at the holdco? BethBombara: Yeah, maybe a little bit less than that depending on your other corporate actions \u2013 yeah, maybe a little bit less than that depending on you know other things that we might do relative to contributions to our pension plan that we make usually in the third quarter. But I'd expected it would be roughly around $2 billion. IanGutterman: Got it, okay. And that\u2019s without the AMT, because that doesn't hit cash till \u201819. BethBombara: Right, that would not be in the 2018 numbers. IanGutterman: Perfect, okay. So Chris I guess, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more, I know you've already commented, but on the capital side, I guess I don't understand the harm in putting an authorization out there, even you don't have to necessarily commit to using it tomorrow. But let's just say that what happened with Facebook yesterday or the President or something or whatever and the market is down 20% in the next three months, wouldn\u2019t you want to have an authorization out there? Why don\u2019t you have it out there as an option? Just because you point out it doesn\u2019t say you have to use the whole thing. ChrisSwift: You know thanks Ian. I understand your point of view, I do and you\u2019ve communicated clearly. I guess the simplest way I can explain it is given our real intention and I understand you know the different scenarios that you just pointed out, but I wanted to be as crystal clear as possible. If we\u2019re going to be buying shares and we wanted time to continue to deploy that capital into revenue streams if possible, we didn\u2019t want create any confusion. So that's the simplest way as I could say it and I didn\u2019t really want to signal that we were going to be in the market and you did the math on that holdco. We are not sitting on a lot of excess capital today, it does build over time. So as we sit here, here and now and project in the near term, I just didn't want to confuse anyone. IanGutterman: No, that's right. I guess the one thing I had to push back on a little bit is that you don\u2019t have a lot of excess capital today. I mean it's a significant part of your market cap, right and you could do another Aetna and still be fine and then have healthy dividends for \u201819 plus AMT, plus tax sharing, right. I mean it\u2019s generally when we project to the end of \u201919 you get to some pretty significant numbers. So I mean can you give us a sense of the timetable? Is there something every quarter we should expect another update on whether there will be a changer or we're going to have -- maybe you want to address it again until you give guidance for \u201819 or sort of when should we expect another update is maybe the best way to ask it? ChrisSwift: Well Ian as you pointed out, I mean\u201919 is six quarters away. We\u2019ll have a lot of opportunities to communicate and interact and keep you posted. As you know I think we're very transparent. So all I would ask you to be is patient and we'll keep you posted. IanGutterman: Alright. Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from a line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. JayGelb: Thank you. I will not ask about buybacks, how about that. First on pace of reserve releases, its five consecutive quarters that Hartford\u2019s been able to put up overall reserve releases. Is this something you think we should start taking in on a go forward basis? BethBombara: So Jay, its Beth. I mean we said this before. I mean we evaluate our reserve every quarter and we make adjustments accordingly. We don't predict whether or not there'll be future reserve releases. We've been very pleased with the underlying trend that we've seen and we'll just continue to evaluate it every quarter, you know line by line which is what we do and give you the transparency as to where we're seeing either improvement or areas that we need to add. JayGelb: Let me see, okay. And then broadly on asbestos with the new Talcott-related exposure for J&J, just trying to think about how that might affect Hartford if there were some old occurrence liability policies out there from decades ago. I know the company typically does its annual review in the fourth quarter and it does have the adverse development cover in place with Berkshire, but just want get any broad thought you might have on Talcott related exposure. Thanks. BethBombara: Sure, so a couple of things. I'm sure it won't surprise you to know that you know we have a team that is constantly looking at emerging towards issues. And the alleged connection between Talc and ovarian cancer has been on our radar for quite some time, and we take into consideration you know all the facts that we know as we evaluate our reserves and an overall feel very good about where our reserve stand. As it relates to our adverse coverage, its one thing that I will point, we do have an adverse cover with Berkshire, but specifically alleged connections between Talc and ovarian cancer and exposure there is specifically excluded from that cover and we obviously take that into consideration. (Cross Talk). JayGelb: Sorry to cut you off, but why is that, why would it have been excluded? BethBombara: That was part of the contact and what we negotiated. So that was specifically excluded. JayGelb: Alright so, I guess I can apply it was known about at that time when the deal was done? BethBombara: Known that we excluded it? JayGelb: Known that it was a potential exposure. ChrisSwift: Jay its best said, we\u2019ve been following this. I mean we have a world class claims team and particularly amass to our team, so a lot of these things aren\u2019t new to us and we've been on it for a while. JayGelb: I appreciate that, thanks. BethBombara: Thanks. I would note we're coming up on the hour and we've got a number of other people still in the queue. So Dan, we\u2019ll take one more question now and then I can follow up with everyone else in the queue after the call. Operator : Certainly. Your final question today will come from the line of Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. RandyBinner: Thanks, I just had a couple follow-ups, real quick. Did you cover specifically on Commercial Auto, where you think price versus loss cost is now? And then the second one, the frequency in workers\u2019 comp. I'm not sure I actually heard what it is? Is it people getting car accidents while they're at the job or is there some kind of slip and fall thing happening out there. You alluded to you had less experienced workers, but if there is a thing that\u2019s actually happening that causes the frequency at work, I'd be interested in that? ChrisSwift: Okay Randy, let me take them each separately. On the Commercial Auto front, we're still getting strong single digit pricing in auto and I expect that to be on top of trends. So good news there from Commercial Auto -- still more work to be done, but good news in terms of where we are in the current quarter. Relative to frequency, you know I suggested that we believe there are some macro factors across the industry relative to employment and inexperienced workers that is driving the trend. It's going to take time for us to mature those observations and we are spending a lot of time looking at SAC class, geographies, size of risk, etcetera, etcetera, but know we are cost cutting the data very hard and at the moment it looks a little more broad based than just a couple of classes and we see this inexperienced worker dynamic where they tend to be injured in a more frequent basis than our more experienced workers. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody on the call. It\u2019s just a fact of something as underwriters we have to deal with every day in our risk business. RandyBinner: Okay, but you can't point to it being you know \u2013 I mean so we've seen auto accidents creep into some other workers comp companies. So I'm just trying to just isolate that and I guess the answer is you don't know and then back on Commercial Auto, you said you are over trying to buy, like how many \u2013 roughly how many basis points do you think you're over pricing over loss cost in commercial auto? DougElliot: Yeah, let me just go back to your first point. At this point I don't see the full connection. I don't think auto is driving our workers comp frequency increase. We\u2019ll continue to study as it changes and I\u2019ll share that going forward. And secondly, we don\u2019t share specifically, exactly those points, but it\u2019s a couple of points over the top of the loss trend at this point relative to pricing versus trend. RandyBinner: That's great, thanks a lot. ChrisSwift: But Doug I\u2019d make a point too that it's still not anywhere near where we want to be from a long term return point of view. So the current year and maybe the last eighteen months we were out earning loss trends, but there are still ways to go to get to an overall acceptable combined ratio. DougElliot: I agree with that Chris. RandyBinner: Thank you. Beth Bombara : Thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate the attention to our earnings results and all the questions that you have. Sean and I will follow up with those of you who are still in the queue after the call. Thank you very much and hope you have a great summer weekend. Operator : Thank you to everyone for attending today. This will conclude today\u2019s call and you may now disconnect.",

Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford had a great quarter with excellent financial results and significant progress on our strategic goals. Third quarter core earnings were $1.15 per diluted share, up significantly from $0.35 last year. Year-to-date, The Hartford\u2019s core earnings are $3.55 per share compared with $1.94 in 2017. The higher level of earnings this quarter and for the year were driven by several items, including better underwriting results in property and casualty, increased Group Benefits in Mutual Funds earnings and a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Let me share some details on these items. P&C underwriting margins, which Doug will cover in more details, improved with a third quarter combined ratio of 97.3 and 95.4 for the nine months. The underlying combined ratio was 93.2 and 91.3, respectively, each better by nearly a point over last year. Group Benefits earnings for the quarter and year-to-date were up 50% and 74%, respectively, due to the acquisition and lower tax rates. Margins remain very strong with the core earnings margin for the first nine months of 6.4%, including the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Excluding intangibles, the core earnings margin was 7.5% compared with 6.1% last year. And Mutual Funds core earnings were up more than 50% for the quarter and year-to-date with continued growth in assets under management. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, grew 11% since December 31st and the annualized year-to-date core earnings ROE was 12.7%. Looking at earnings and returns for both the quarter and the year, I\u2019m very pleased with our overall results. This quarter, we made continued progress on important strategic and operational goals. In August, we announced the agreement to acquire The Navigators Group. This acquisition advances several of our key objectives. It enhances our Commercial Lines presence with specialty and E&S capabilities, it broadens and deepens our product offerings with expanded industry verticals and it expands our geographic underwriting reach with an international presence. Leading agents and brokers are demanding deep expertise in comprehensive risk solutions across many industries from their carrier partners. With our expanded platform, particularly in specialty lines and industry verticals for middle market, we will strengthen distribution relationships and improve our access to new business opportunities. A combination of our capabilities and talent with the diverse product offerings and deep expertise of The Navigators team, we\u2019ll accelerate the next stage of our journey as a market leading Commercial Lines company. This acquisition is strategically important to The Hartford. Achieving the financial targets we have set forth will require effort and team work. We are focused on executions and recently kicked off a joint planning process regarding integration. We are excited to work with our future colleagues to develop our go-to-market plans. As previously discussed, we expect to generate core earnings before intangibles of 200 million within four to five years. About half of the increase from Navigators current run rate earnings will come from relatively straightforward investment portfolio and expense actions that will begin to impact earnings in the first year. We expect the remainder of the increase to be achieved over time from top line growth and improved underwriting margins. We look forward to sharing our future plans and progress with you. Another key accomplishment is the continued successful integration of our Group Benefits acquisition which closed almost a year ago today. This quarter, we began deploying the disability claims and lead management platform across both books, and renewing former Aetna contracts onto The Hartford systems. January 1, 2019 new sales and renewals, which are in the line with our expectations, is another important milestone. We\u2019ve had outstanding financial results this year despite higher than normal catastrophes. Although workers\u2019 compensation 2018 frequency trends are elevated from expectation, it\u2019s a modest change in trend that we\u2019re addressing. Total workers\u2019 compensation results this quarter continued to be quite strong. I\u2019m pleased with the speed and diligence of our team in identifying this trend which reflects favorably on the capabilities of our new claims system and the competitive advantage of our expanded data and analytical skills. Finally, just a few comments on capital management before turning the call over to Doug. In 2012, we began the transformation of The Hartford away from capital market sensitive businesses to more underwriting centric ones. Since that time from organic excess capital generation and the proceeds of sales of businesses, we have redeployed a significant amount of capital in a balanced manner including equity repurchases, acquisitions and debt reductions. In total, we returned more than 50% of the total to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. Since 2011, we have repurchased approximately 35% of our outstanding shares, most of which was done at prices less than book value. In addition, almost 25% was used to strengthen the balance sheet which earned us several credit upgrades in the process. These actions included debt repayment, the asbestos environmental reinsurance cover purchase and a reduction in our pension liability. Lastly, the remaining 4 billion or 25% was used for several acquisitions, including Navigators, which have met our strategic goals and financial targets. As I reflect back on this track record, I am proud of the balance that we have struck in our deployment of capital. We have repositioned our portfolio of businesses to underwriting centric product lines where we have made deliberate investments both organic and inorganic, and we have done this whilst strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders. As I look to the future, our near-term focus is squarely on the successful integration of Aetna and Navigators acquisitions with the goal of achieving and ultimately exceeding our expected returns on these investments. These integrations will consume much of our operational bandwidth for the time being. Looking forward, we expect our businesses will continue to generate excess capital over time. In the medium to long term, we will continue to be deliberate in deploying this capital to create shareholder value. As we do so, our philosophy around capital management will remain consistent. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy excess capital, including investing in our businesses and capital management which includes reducing leverage with the focus on both financial returns and strategic objectives. To conclude, Hartford made a tremendous amount of progress against our strategic goals over the past year. Looking forward, we are excited by the opportunities we see to build on the momentum as we move into 2019. We look forward to sharing our progress with you. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We posted strong results this quarter in property and casualty and Group Benefits. In Commercial Lines, we\u2019re pleased with our performance and returns, particularly as markets remain competitive and workers\u2019 compensation rates are increasingly under pressure. In Personal Lines, auto loss trends remained favorable and new business growth rates improved. And in Group Benefits margins remain very strong as we continue to execute on our integration plans. It was another active quarter for catastrophes, but losses were well below third quarter 2017. This year, Hurricane Florence was the single largest event of the quarter but there were also a number of wind, hail and wildfire events contributing to losses. Current year cat losses in the quarter totaled 169 million, 183 million less than a year ago. Before I cover results for our business units, I\u2019d like to comment briefly on workers\u2019 compensation trends updating my observations from our second quarter earnings call. The market remains competitive as industry returns have been strong over the last five years. Loss cost trends over the same period have been quite moderate with low severity and negative frequency trends, driven by favorable economic fundamentals as we emerged from the Great Recession. With the economy at or near full employment, our frequency in small commercial and middle market has turned positive this year. Based on our business and economic analysis, we view this trend as broader than just our book of business. With the unemployment rate below 4% for the last six months, the ratio of unemployed workers compared to open jobs has continued to decline. This ratio is now below 1 for the first time since 2001, the first year this metric was tracked. Many businesses are struggling to find qualified employees and beginning to add more new workers to their payroll, generally increasing the risk of workplace injury versus what it would have been say a year or two ago. Additionally, the tightening labor market produces more hours work for employee often resulting in fatigue and less training time compounding the risk of injury for the less experience workers. Our uptick in frequency change has been moderate turning positive on a rolling 12-month basis. The actual frequency levels are now comparable to what we experienced in 2016 which is a very manageable shift in a book of business as large as ours. The frequency increase is more pronounced among less tenured employees and it can be several times that of experienced workers. All-in-all, we see this shift as part of managing both the industry cycle and the broader economic cycle. This includes making appropriate adjustments to underwriting, pricing and loss ratio selections. We are deep inside our workers\u2019 compensation analytics and profitability measures across geographies, accounts size, industry class, risk profile and loss experience. Based on this analysis, our 2018 accident year loss ratio for middle market workers\u2019 compensation is 3.5 points higher than 2017. No changes have been in small commercial as current accident year loss cost trends remain within our overall estimates. This recent frequency trend has not changed our view of accident years 2017 and prior. Workers\u2019 compensation is a very important line to us. We have the expertise, tools and data to address exactly these types of market challenges and we will continue to manage all the levers available to us as we stay on top of these trends. Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. In Commercial Lines, the combined ratio improved 12.5 points from prior year to 96.1 due to lower catastrophe losses and a higher favorable prior year development. The prior year development was driven by continued favorable trends in workers\u2019 compensation from accident years 2015 and prior and favorable emergence in financial products. The underlying combined ratio for commercial lines, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, was 93.7 deteriorating half a point from last year but still very healthy. This change was largely due to workers\u2019 compensation margin compression in middle market as we react proactively to the frequency trends I described earlier and adverse non-cat property results in small commercial, largely offset by favorable results in general liability and commercial auto. Looking at pricing, our renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines was 1.7%, down sequentially from second quarter by 130 basis points. This was heavily driven by the competitive workers\u2019 compensation environment. Standard Commercial Lines pricing, excluding workers\u2019 compensation, was 4.9% in the quarter, essentially in line with second quarter. Within our Commercial Line business units, small commercial continued its strong performance with an underlying combined ratio of 88.7. The margin improvement versus last year was driven by general liability and auto, partially offset by higher non-cat property losses and slightly higher expenses. Written premium was up slightly as we begin to see business flows from the Foremost renewal rights deal, partially offset by the downward pressure on workers\u2019 compensation rates and competitive market conditions for both new business and renewal. Small commercial policy counts have been increasing quarter-over-quarter in 2018 having declined throughout 2017. This reflects our disciplined approach to profitable growth. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve reduced our small commercial auto book of business to improve profitability. Likewise, we\u2019ve made adjustments to our packaged policy appetite to improve returns. Our margins in small commercial are industry leading as is our platform for new business and service. We\u2019re very excited about our long-term prospects for growth in this segment of the market. In middle market, the underlying combined ratio of 100.2 increased 3.2 points from 2017 with 2.6 points of that increase due to higher current accident year loss ratio and workers\u2019 compensation. Written premium was up 6.5% over last year with solid production in line such as property and general liability as well as verticals such as construction and energy, offset by declines in workers\u2019 compensation. In specialty commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 96 improved 2.6 points driven by an adjustment to reflect higher premiums on retrospectively rated accounts and lower expenses, offset by slight margin compression in national accounts and financial products. Moving over to Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 91.8 improved 3.1 points representing 5.5 points of improvement in the underlying loss ratio, partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio. The loss ratio improvement is reflected in both our auto and homeowner results driven by earned pricing increases and favorable auto loss cost trends and non-cat homeowners experience. The higher expense ratio is primarily due to lower earned premiums versus last year and increased marketing efforts in AARP Direct where we are focused on new business growth and retention. New business was up over 30% in AARP Direct auto. Our marketing spend and product adjustments continue to gain traction and our competitiveness measures continue to improve. We are pleased with the underlying profile of this growth and encouraged by the improving trends. Despite strong improvement in new business growth, total written premium was still down 7.6%. Retention remains below our long-term targets as prior rate increases and a reduced agency footprint continue to work through our book of business. However, as those rate changes decelerate, retention is improving. And coupled with our new business trends will provide a strong foundation for future growth. Group Benefits delivered another excellent quarter. Core earnings was 102 million with a margin of 6.7%. The increase versus last year is primarily driven by strong organic growth, the addition of our 2017 acquisition and lower tax rates. Although the group disability loss ratio was up slightly versus last year which experienced unusually high claim recoveries, we continue to see very strong disability results including favorable emergence from recent accident years. The group life loss ratio improved slightly from the volatile adverse trends experienced in recent quarters. Persistency on our employer group block of business remains steady at approximately 90% and fully insured ongoing sales of 104 million were up 53% from prior year. January 2019 sales in national accounts are firming up and we expect a strong start to next year. Our expanded sales team is executing very effectively in the market and our differentiated service and claims value proposition is clearly resonating with employers. We\u2019re excited about how this business is positioned in the marketplace. We will remain very pleased with the overall integration of the Aetna Group Benefits business. We have completed the conversion of former Aetna small business customers to the Hartford platform. Conversion of middle market and large case customers to the Hartford platform is on track to begin in December and will continue throughout 2019 and 2020. In summary, this was a very solid quarter across our property and casualty and Group Benefits businesses. We are executing effectively against our plans, responding to loss cost trends and competitive market dynamics with appropriate pricing actions and disciplined underwriting. We continue to make excellent progress on our initiatives and product operations and technology, all of which contribute to a competitive platform for the years ahead. We are also very encouraged about the possibilities with our announced acquisition of Navigators. As Chris has shared, we have kicked off integration activities across all business disciplines and we will share more details at an appropriate time. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I\u2019m going to cover investment results, mutual funds and corporate earnings as well as book value and ROEs. In addition, I have a few updates on The Navigators acquisition and holding company resources. Starting with investments, net investment income totaled 444 million, up 10% over the prior year quarter due a 9% increase in invested assets primarily as a result of the higher level of invested assets in Group Benefits from last year\u2019s acquisitions. Limited partnership income did not meaningfully impact the compares into 2017 as third quarter LP income was 45 million for tax, down 3 million compared with third quarter 2017. Excluding LPs, the annualized portfolio yield was 3.7%, down slightly from 3.8% in third quarter 2017 due to the impact of the acquired Group Benefits assets being reported at market yields and the higher level of holding company resources held largely in short-term investments. The P&C investment yield was up modestly to 3.8% primarily due to higher interest rates. For the consolidated investment portfolio, the average new money rate in the quarter exceeded the average yield on sales and maturities by about 20 basis points. This reflected higher interest rates as well as a roughly 400 million reduction during the quarter, an exposure to municipal given favorable after tax yields on comparable taxable investments. The credit performance on the investment portfolio remains very strong. Net impairments in the quarter totaled 1 million, flat with third quarter 2017. Turning to mutual funds. Third quarter core earnings were 41 million, up nearly 60% from last year due to both higher assets under management and a lower tax rate. Total mutual fund and ETP assets under management, which excludes assets related to Talcott Resolution, was 106 billion at the end of the quarter, up 10%. This growth was driven principally by market appreciation as well as by positive net flows of 1.3 billion over the last 12 months. Funds performance remains strong as 61% and 69% of funds beat their peers on a three and five-year basis, respectively. Core losses in corporate were 45 million in the third quarter, down from 68 million last year. There were a few ongoing items that affected results this quarter. First, interest expense declined by 10 million before tax both on a sequential basis and compared with third quarter 2017 due to net debt repayment over the period including the June 2018 call of 500 million of hybrids which had a coupon of eight and an eighth percent [ph]. In addition, there were several items related to Talcott including the Hartford\u2019s share of income from its 9.7% ownership interest. Similar to our other private equity investments, income on this investment is reported on a three-month lag. As the sale closed at the end of May, this quarter\u2019s results include income for the month of June which was about 2 million. Fourth quarter 2018 will reflect a full three months of results. The amount of income recorded each quarter will be 9.7% of Talcott\u2019s net income, which as you know can fluctuate based on market conditions and the impact of hedging. In addition, fee income in corporate included approximately 11 million of revenue for a full quarter of managing investments for Talcott. This was offset by corresponding investment management expenses. Stranded costs related to Talcott were about 9 million before tax. We expect these costs to be eliminated over the next 15 months. Finally, net investment income for the quarter included income on the net proceeds received from the Talcott sale of 1.5 billion. In total, The Hartford\u2019s third quarter core earnings were 418 million, up from 130 million in third quarter 2017 due to higher earnings in each of the company\u2019s main business segments, including the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate. Core earnings per diluted share were $1.15. As a reminder, in July we announced an increase in our quarterly common dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, the sixth consecutive annual increase as a result of stronger earnings from our businesses. Book value per diluted share at September 30 was $34.95, down 6% from December 31, largely due to the impact of higher interest rates on the fair value of the investment portfolio and the removal of AOCI related to the Talcott sale. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share of $39.12 increased 11% since December 31. Core earnings ROE, which is calculated on a rolling 12-month basis, was 10.3% in third quarter of 2018, up more than 4 points from last year due in part to strong operating results including the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate as well as lower average equity to the sale of Talcott and the fourth quarter charge related to tax reform. Our annualized 2018 year-to-date core earnings ROE was 12.7%. Before taking your questions, I\u2019ll provide a brief update on The Navigators Group acquisition. The go shop period under the acquisition agreement expired without any competing bids and Navigators have filed their proxy with an expected shareholder meeting date of November 16. The antitrust waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino expired last week and we have filed the required change and control materials with the regulators, including New York, the UK and Belgium. We continue to expect it closing in the first half of 2019 subject to those approvals and have begun integration and planning activities with The Navigators team. While the acquisition does not have a financing contingency, we continue to evaluate financing alternatives to maintain appropriate levels of holding company liquidity post closing. Holding company resources at September 30 were 2.3 billion compared with a cash purchase price of approximately 2.2 billion including expenses. Last week, we filed a dividend request with the Connecticut Department of Insurance to accelerate our 2019 planned P&C dividend to fourth quarter 2018. This dividend of approximately 1 billion will help provide financial flexibility and liquidity to support 2019 interest expense and dividend payments and the January 2019 bond maturity. As we have discussed in the past, we had a robust framework around evaluating capital margins and liquidity requirements across our company. Importantly, our approach begins with maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity in our operating insurance companies for stress scenarios that contemplate much higher catastrophe and credit losses than are typical. In those stress scenarios, we seek to maintain P&C capital at an AA level based on S&P models and Group Benefits capital at a 350% RBC. We also seek to maintain sufficient operating company liquidity to meet cash flow related stresses such as large catastrophes. Capital resources at the holding company are also evaluated for liquidity requirements and stress scenarios. We begin with the minimum target of holding company cash and short-term investments sufficient to cover interest and dividend payment for the next 12 months which is about 700 million currently, as well as some provision for upcoming debt maturities depending on our financing plans. Capital resources above this level are what we consider excess and can be redeployed for other opportunities. Based on our current projections, after the closing of The Navigators transaction we expect the level of excess capital resources will begin to rebuild in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020. Consistent with our longstanding philosophy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for the use of any excess capital including investing in our businesses and capital management opportunity. To conclude, this marked another quarter of strong underwriting and investment results for The Hartford with core earnings growth at each of our main business segments and steady progress on the Group Benefits integration. Looking forward, we are optimistic about closing 2018 on a strong note with sustained healthy margins and the benefit of rising interest rates, although fourth quarter results will be impacted by Hurricane Michael. Based on claims received and inspected to-date, we currently expect our Hurricane Michael losses to be 50 million or less before tax. As a reminder, our original cat estimate for fourth quarter was about 55 million pre-tax. So we may come in above that number depending on our final estimate for Michael and any additional cat activity for the quarter. Finally, consistent with prior years we will provide a 2019 business metric outlook in February when we report fourth quarter results. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator so we can begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Randy Binner from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Randy Binner : Good morning. Thanks. I guess the question and what seems to be driving the stock today I think is the commentary around high loss picks and workers\u2019 comp. And I appreciate the straightforward way that you communicated it. And so the question I have is what kind of claims are we talking about here? So you have a pretty broad book. Is it kind of basic slip and falls, is it auto accidents, is it something else? You are addressing it and you are making a higher loss pick. So it will be helpful I think for me and others to understand what kind of losses are hurting you with less experience workers? Chris Swift : Randy, it\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll start and Doug will add his commentary. I think the context on the whole discussion hopefully you sensed from our commentary is we\u2019re starting in a very good position. This is a product line that is performing well. It\u2019s a large product line for us where we have great data and insights across the country. So as we\u2019re trying to ascribe when we see a little pressure in the context of a particularly small and middle market, it is an overall manageable trend line through adjustments in pricing, through adjustments in underwriting as Doug would say. So I would like you and our investors to understand that the starting point is strong, it\u2019s healthy and this is not a runaway train situation with loss cost trends and frequency. So, Doug, can you add some color on the types of claims we\u2019re seeing? Doug Elliot : I will. So, Randy, when I think about injury types and I look across and we have spent time looking across fractures, sprains, contusions, slips and falls, et cetera, we see general uptick in frequency across all those injury types. So as I\u2019ve described to you, we are looking deeply in the book. We\u2019re seeing some of those trends in both small and middle. But I can\u2019t sit here today based on the data and the reviews we\u2019ve done and suggest here it\u2019s only a couple of injury types. It looks a bit more broad-based and a bit more elevated in the experience worker defined by workers in position less than one year. Randy Binner : And then the follow up I have there is that if those were kind of I guess higher frequency, lower severity type workers\u2019 comp claims, is that having inflation from trial attorneys and medical costs or is it more just kind of a frequency thing? Doug Elliot : We certainly feel like right now our severity is in pretty good shape. We\u2019re watching that carefully. This looks to us like numbers of accidents are up which is inside that frequency ratio and it looks isolated there. And I don\u2019t feel the external litigation as a factor. I feel injury and experience as a driving factor. Randy Binner : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning. Thanks for the color on workers\u2019 compensation. I had a follow up on that and this ties back to Randy\u2019s question. Would it be possible to remind us either what the top NCCI hazard classes are or even talk what are the top classes which make up your workers\u2019 compensation book? Doug Elliot : Amit, let me try to just share a profile of our book of business. I\u2019ll let you do the work of NCCI. So obviously our middle market book is extensive classes; so construction, manufacturing, retail, wholesale. Essentially we\u2019re in the entire middle market space with very few exceptions. So it\u2019s broad based and certainly that would be the case for our small commercial market as well. We offer pretty extensive product and there are a very few sectors of the economy that we don\u2019t touch. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re sitting here talking about a specialty based market that is lasered into two or three SIC Code. That\u2019s not indeed the case with our book. Amit Kumar : That\u2019s actually very helpful. But the other sort of unrelated question and this might be for Chris or someone else. You talked a bit about Navigators and on the last call we had talked about harmonizing the reserves. Is there any update whatsoever on that process? And obviously you spent a quarter now or a few months. Do you feel any differently versus what you might have looked at that time? Thanks. Chris Swift : Yes, as I said in my prepared commentary, we\u2019re beginning the integration planning process and I think it would be realistic to assume that we\u2019ll look at what Navigators does between now and closing with any reserve positions and may our adjustments at closing. So there is really nothing that we can comment upon now until we own the property. Amit Kumar : Thanks for the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Good morning. Sorry, I also had a couple of questions on workers\u2019 comp. Doug, I appreciate the disclosure. You\u2019ve kind of tried to say we\u2019re back to where you guys were in 2016. Yet you guys are attributing this to pretty low unemployment levels, obviously more inexperience workers in the workplace. So the unemployment rate is obviously lower than what it was in 2016. So when you guys look at your book and what you\u2019re seeing out there, how do we know that this will not get worse? Doug Elliot : Elyse, I guess I can\u2019t promise or suggest that I know exactly how the world\u2019s going to play out in 2019. What we do think we have a good handle on is how 2018 is playing out. I would say to you that we\u2019ll have a great sense of where frequency lands for the 2018 accident year within a quarter or two into '19. These are not long developing estimates on the frequency side. It\u2019s claims in the door. The first quarter is relatively mature right now from '18. Second quarter is maturing as we speak. And so it\u2019s a fast line to measure. The work we\u2019re doing in terms of trying to predict and make our best assessment of '19 is going on as we speak which is why we\u2019ll bring it altogether in February when we talk and give you our predictions for 2019. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then you guys have often said and others in the industry as well just given the very strong possibility of comp that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen a lot of rate declines. Can this higher frequency give you the ability to get actuarial justified rate increases, or do you still think just given that the margins still seem to be even this uptick in frequency still pretty attractive that we will still see price declines in the business from here? Doug Elliot : Elyse, you\u2019re right. The absolute level of performance across comp across multiple sectors is very healthy right now and certainly our book demonstrates that as well. The other fact is that as rates are worked on across the industry and loss cost trends are filed by the NCCI and carriers like ourselves are adopting multipliers and dropping our own experience over the top, they\u2019re using prior experience periods. So as I look out across the various states and I think about the various effective dates for the changes dropping into '19, they\u2019re still looking back at prior years which are very healthy. So we\u2019re balancing that. We\u2019re obviously working levers in our own underwriting machines trying to make sure that our underwriters have the greatest sense of where we sense trends are. We\u2019re adjusting based on experience to the account, what we know about the class, et cetera, et cetera, and bringing all that to bear and making choices to either write, renew or to not offer a quote when we feel like the price won\u2019t match our fundamental economic goals. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then one last question. Overall prices for small and middle market did decelerate away from comp. Can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s going on broadly in the Commercial Lines market and would the Q3 pricing levels be what you would expect to continue into the fourth quarter? Doug Elliot : Yes, I see a pretty stable environment non-comp across all the other lines and I expect to see that into the fourth quarter. So I don\u2019t see any drivers of change with the one exception that we continue to see weather in certain parts of the country and I expect to see a bit of tightening maybe in terms and also in pricing on the property side geography based. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question kind of to follow up on Elyse\u2019s last question there, I guess more at a higher level if you could talk about. Your margins in the small commercial are clearly better and have been than the middle market. So if you could just at a higher level the difference in the competitive landscape between the two if you see any shifts in more competitive environment in general for small book versus the middle market book? Doug Elliot : Relative to small what I would say is we have been a focused small business carrier for a long time. It\u2019s a combination of underwriting acumen, platform, speed automation, retail relationships, et cetera, and that formula continues although in this new digital age we are refreshing that for a world where customers who want to reach out 24/7 and be serviced in different ways. So that is the formula. I think that\u2019s driven our success and we clearly think that\u2019s a great foundation going forward with adjustments we will continue to make. In the middle, it\u2019s been slightly more competitive. I think that has at least been the case in my career that the cycles have had a bit more maybe amplitude to them over time. We see a lot of \u2013 we do see competition there. I think we\u2019ve been successful. We are clearly in the last five to seven years growing our product breadth. Chris has talked to you about what The Navigators will add to our dimension. I think our underwriting acumen continues to improve. Yes, it\u2019s a challenging environment but I think we\u2019ve got great upside and I see us as a key player in that market for the long term. So I\u2019m excited about our prospects. What\u2019s happening now? I see these as kind of shorter-term challenges that we\u2019ll work our way through but I love what we\u2019re doing in middle and I think we\u2019re going to be a terrific player there. Michael Phillips : Okay, great. Thanks. Let me switch over if I could to Personal Lines side, in personal auto specifically. You\u2019re still getting a pretty decent rate there, maybe down a bit sequentially. But the core margins, core combines 96 or so maybe plus a little a bit. Are you where you where you want to be with profitability in personal auto? And maybe throwing kind of what you\u2019re kind of seeing from the competitive landscape. And on that line your drop-in pits [ph], what that means by your competitive position. Thanks. Doug Elliot : From a profit perspective, we\u2019re very pleased about where we are; pleased about our performance, pleased about the trends we see in our book. So just an aggregate performance comment that yes, we\u2019re very pleased about today. The other side is we\u2019d like to be growing a bit more. And so as we have gone through, made changes to get the health back in the profitability piece, we know we\u2019ve got to continue to adjust to get our new business stimulated. So we are keenly aware of that, focused on that, working every side of that as I have talked in prior quarters about what we\u2019re doing inside our sales engine. What we\u2019re working on the actuarial front and I\u2019ve now seen progress as I\u2019ve evidenced through the numbers I\u2019ve shared with our direct auto ARP growth on new over the last couple of quarters. I expect that to continue and we\u2019re working hard to make that happen. Chris Swift : Doug, I think you really pointed out too that we are spending more to stimulate response \u2013 responses are up, conversions are up, new business period-over-period is up. We\u2019re working with ARP differently about how we can begin to market to their membership base. The partnerships\u2019 never been stronger or more vibrant in my particular point of view. And I think '19 growth will start to kick in, in a more meaningful way that you\u2019ll be able to see, Mike. Michael Phillips : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First one for Doug. Just trying to get some confidence that next quarter we\u2019re not going to be taking another charge for workers\u2019 comp, you brought this up second quarter and then there\u2019s another charge this quarter. So just trying to understand what are you assuming \u2013 what exactly needs to happen for you to have to take up your loss pick again? Are you assuming positive frequency now? Where exactly are we? Doug Elliot : Ryan, our accident year 2018 pick for comp, we feel very solid about it across all our lines of business and we\u2019re assuming that our estimate of trends in those assumptions is solid and it will repeat itself in Q4. So that\u2019s about all I can share. I feel like we\u2019re on top of what we need to. I don\u2019t expect any surprises but I also don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a world return to negative frequency in the next three months. Ryan Tunis : Got you, okay. And the other one is really just for Chris and it\u2019s more just about \u2013 it\u2019s I guess the stock price underperformance year-to-date, you guys gave guidance in February and I think you\u2019re going to exceed guidance in basically every single segment. You\u2019ve deployed capital. And I guess when you just kind of look at how the stock has been working, is there anything you think that you could be doing differently over the next 12 months that you plan on doing that Hartford could do better or differently that you think could maybe be helpful? Thanks. Chris Swift : Sure. I\u2019m just going to tag onto Doug\u2019s last comment on the prior question on fourth quarter and basically heading into '19. Remember the frequency numbers we quote is a rate of change. It\u2019s not an absolute I\u2019ll call it numeric level of frequency. So my noneconomic analysis is we should not see a continued rate of change increase even at low employment levels given time does help with training or job skills. So as long as employment doesn\u2019t lag down to, say, in the 2.5% range I think there is a general level of stability in the workforce education training in the sectors that Doug mentioned. But again, it\u2019s something to watch which again with our advanced data and analytics we\u2019re all over. I think your commentary on the stock price, we share your frustration, if I could read between the lines. We think we\u2019re doing the right things to create shareholder value over a longer period of time and we\u2019re going to continue to do what we believe is right. And the only thing that Beth and I will particularly do is just spend a little bit more time with investors communicating, being crystal clear on priorities, execution going forward. So that\u2019s probably the big thing that I see that we could do at this point in time. Ryan Tunis : So I take that to mean that you think the market is reading too much into this workers\u2019 comp issue as a material problem at Hartford? Chris Swift : Yes, I do. If I think about intrinsic value, if I think about cash flows, if I think about starting points on ROEs and margins, this is a modest pull back in a margin or a loss ratio point or two particularly as we head in '19. The fundamentals of our business are broad based business isn\u2019t really changing. If I look at benefits in the numbers we\u2019ve been putting up there, if I look at all the organic product lines that we\u2019ve been building that will add meaningfully to earnings going forward, again, I still believe we\u2019re doing all the right long-term things and can\u2019t control short-term mark-to-markets and fluctuations and people\u2019s views. All we\u2019re going to try to do is to be as consistent as possible in producing the results that shareholders expect. Ryan Tunis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Thanks. Good morning. First question is on the Group Benefits. It feels like it\u2019s been running ahead of expectations. I know there were some prepared remarks about maybe things were better development than expected. I just wanted to kind of get a sense for whether the loss ratio is trending more favorably and we shouldn\u2019t take that as kind of a run rate level? Beth Bombara : Yes. I\u2019ll take that. So yes, we have seen on our disability book continued favorable experience and sitting here today we\u2019d expect from a loss ratio perspective to see some continuation of that. Again, if you look at our development there it definitely has been higher than we would have expected. But again a lot of that is related to more recent experience, so you so sort of expect that experience to continue in the short term. It\u2019s sort of different then when you think of longer-term P&C type liabilities where you\u2019re making adjustments on very old accident years that maybe don\u2019t indicate kind of current trends. So we\u2019re very pleased with how that book is performing overall and like the momentum that we see. Mike Zaremski : That\u2019s helpful, Beth. Switching gears to homeowners; we\u2019ve had a couple peers saw deterioration in the underlying, you guys didn\u2019t. But some of those peers also mentioned kind of trends that were negatively impacting the \u2013 they think the broader space in terms of more water and fire losses. Are you guys seeing any of that in your book? Doug Elliot : Mike, our homeowners\u2019 book has been running really sound this year. We\u2019ve worked on that for the last three to four years. So as we rebuilding auto both in the financial health and the product, we were also doing a lot of work at homeowner. So I attribute our strong performance, number one, to the underwriting actions, the earned pricing actions over the last couple of years. And then there\u2019s always volatility and this is a pretty good quarter. So I\u2019m not going to suggest that we\u2019re not going to ever have volatility again in line but I feel pretty good about our homeowners\u2019 line. And our ex-cat weather is running very favorable at the moment. Mike Zaremski : Okay. If I can sneak one last one in for Beth. It sounds like Talcott from the prepared remarks had some benefit from capital markets and that could be choppy going forward and this might not be the run rate. Is that the right way to categorize that? Beth Bombara : Yes, again, if you go back and look at when we owned 100% of Talcott and again look at the net income numbers, because again oftentimes people focus on core earnings which are a little bit more predictable. But we\u2019ll be picking up our share of their total net income which would include any impact of hedging. And we pointed it just could be volatile period-to-period, so I wouldn\u2019t want someone to take $2 million for one month and assume that that\u2019s sort of the run rate. Mike Zaremski : I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Thank you. Two questions. The first one is a quick one and you might have said it. I\u2019m looking at my notes for the dollar value number of the 3Q reset in workers\u2019 comp versus the 2Q reset. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve said that. But if you haven\u2019t, if would be great. Doug Elliot : Josh, I don\u2019t have that. What I did say is that our accident year '18 number in middle market is up 3.5 points over the '17 accident year number, that\u2019s 3.5. We did move that in the quarter. A couple of points. I don\u2019t have the dollar component of that but it\u2019s just math. So it\u2019s 1 million not tens of millions. Josh Shanker : And that\u2019s all workers\u2019 comp? Doug Elliot : That was the workers\u2019 comp I\u2019m talking about what we did. Josh Shanker : Okay. And the second question, maybe I\u2019ll dig in a little bit. With the sale of Talcott, it looks like the mutual fund business still is producing the same type of earnings power. With that loss, are you going to continue? Is there any risk that those funds go away I guess? And that kind of dovetails into very strong corporate results, which I think there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces and I think it\u2019s mostly Talcott related if you can sort of talk about what the going forward earnings power is I guess of the corporate segment and the mutual fund business post Talcott? Chris Swift : I\u2019ll let Beth talk about the corporate segment. But on mutual funds, again I think you can see the Talcott AUM roughly 16 million-ish \u2013 billion, excuse me, been pretty stable. So there should just by our ownership change to new owners and in and by itself that will not going to change that relationship. Those funds inside the VAs are still managed by Wellington. So the only thing, Josh, there is just your views on how quickly has that block run off and what happens to the AUM if there\u2019s any changes in market conditions and performance. But I don\u2019t see much change right now. It should be pretty stable. Beth, can you add your color on -- Beth Bombara : Yes, so on the corporate piece, again, as you pointed out there were a couple of moving pieces this quarter. I think the biggest one really I think is the reduction in interest expense when you kind of think about that from an ongoing perspective. A lot of the Talcott balances that I referenced, some of those kind of net out with the revenue versus the cost that we have. So when I look at the quarter, a 45 million loss for Q3, I kind of see that run rate going forward of being around 50-ish is kind of probably a safe place to be. And obviously that will change depending on what happens with debt cost and then as I said what the actual income pickup we get quarter-to-quarter from the Talcott piece, because again this quarter it was 2 million. I would expect that to bounce around a bit. Josh Shanker : Okay. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Doug, just to comeback with a few workers\u2019 comp questions. The pickup in frequency that you saw, was that just most pronounced in middle market or do you also see that in small commercial? Doug Elliot : Tom, we also saw the pickup in small commercial as well, yes. Tom Gallagher : Got it. And when you mentioned it went from negative to positive frequency, can you quantify that a bit? Was it a small negative to a small positive or a bit wider, the band? Doug Elliot : The frequency trend\u2019s really going back five, six, seven years, but even longer than that have generally been favorable and negative. So that\u2019s the overall industry and certainly our book has performed equally as well. So we\u2019re talking single digit minuses going back in time. That did move to this moderate single digits, small-single digits, mid-single digits as we moved into 2018 accident year. Tom Gallagher : Got it. And then just on the severity side, I think that\u2019s been coming in favorably for a while. Has that trend really been claimed durations or is that lack of wage inflation and would you still expect that to develop favorably on the severity side? Doug Elliot : Tom, when we think about severity we separate the medical from the non-medical and both parts of severity look pretty much in check. So we are aggressively managing with our claim resources and talented medical executives inside the claim \u2013 the medical side and feel good about that, feel good about our workers\u2019 compensation networks, feel good about our strategies and I think are doing a lot to control the medical costs inside our workers\u2019 compensation environment. On the non-medical, our expectation and what we\u2019re seeing in our trends is very moderated. So pleased about those trends, right in line with expectations and as an all-in basis the severity estimates are pretty much on top of what we\u2019re seeing. So I feel good about the severity end of the story. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thank you. A couple of quick questions here. First, aside from workers\u2019 comp you guys are still getting some reasonable rate and I know Doug you talked a little bit about some concerns about maybe GL claims inflation and you haven\u2019t said it this call. I\u2019m curious what your views are going forward. But as I look going forward as that earned rate comes through, is there perhaps some offsets here with the rest of the commercial book on your kind of underlying loss picks versus what\u2019s happening with comp? Doug Elliot : Brian, I look across and we\u2019re spending time on our loss trends across all the lines. And yes, I have talked about liability in the past and we\u2019re watchful of that. We\u2019ve seen a little bit across the industry not just in our book but others have talked about product, others have talked about D&O. It\u2019s a watchful area for us. But in general our loss trends across the non-workers\u2019 comp line is basically in line with our expectations for the year. Brian Meredith : And then are you seeing rate in excess of trend right now aside from workers\u2019 comp? Doug Elliot : I would say it\u2019s more about equal to trend in the aggregate. And again, there is a property story off to the side of this with cat that we all have to come to grips with, right. We\u2019re disappointed in our cat results and have some work to do in our cat pricing, in our cat underwriting, et cetera. But that aside, generally I think we\u2019re holding serve relative to our margins and our non-comp lines. Brian Meredith : Great. And then one other just quick question, is there any kind of read through on sort of what\u2019s going on with comp over to the Group Benefits area, perhaps maybe the lower incidence has something to maybe do with the real good employment situation. Do you think about it that way? Doug Elliot : Good question. We actually obviously watch for that carefully. Our incidence trends and group disability continue to run very strong, but we are watchful. But we don\u2019t see anywhere near or anything like what we\u2019re seeing in workers\u2019 comp but know that we\u2019re on that as well in our group business. Chris Swift : Generally, Brian, injuries versus true disabilities are uncorrelated except in high unemployment scenarios. Brian Meredith : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Jay Cohen : Thank you. Two questions on workers\u2019 compensation. The first is and maybe correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I thought you said that you changed your loss pick in middle market but you did not change the loss pick in small commercial. Did I hear that right? Doug Elliot : That is correct, Jay. Jay Cohen : But you just told somebody else you are seeing increased frequency in small commercial as well as middle market. Doug Elliot : Yes, our loss pick in total in small as we estimated trends and pricing in the year all-in contains everything we\u2019re seeing including a little uptick in frequency in the first nine months of the year. Jay Cohen : Got it. And then secondly on the claims system, you sort of suggested that because of the investments you\u2019ve made in claims, you\u2019ve identified trends quicker than you might have in the past. Can you give us a sense of how that actually worked? What specifically \u2013 what changes did you make that allowed you to pick up those trends? Doug Elliot : We\u2019ll try to do this in five or six sentences or less. It\u2019s a much longer conversation. But essentially we have now installed a new claim platform over our 5,000 desk throughout claim. And the ability to access what I\u2019ll call structured data and to slice and dice and be on top of it and to look at your metrics and watch your trends is much advanced from where we were five years ago. And so we have monthly and weekly discussions but we\u2019re sitting on top of trends that candidly five years ago were very manual in nature to try to get our arms around and they were slower than we\u2019d like to them to be. And so it\u2019s a completely different environment and one that I think is leading to outstanding claim performance. Jay Cohen : It\u2019s an interesting topic. I\u2019ll follow-up offline on that topic later, but thanks for the insight. Sabra Purtill : Thanks, Jay. I think we have two more questioners in the queue and so we\u2019ll finish those up. I know we\u2019re running past a little bit on our time and there\u2019s a 10 o\u2019clock call, but we will finish up the queue. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery Scott. Go ahead, please. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Hartford, and thank you for squeezing me in. On the year-to-date catch up on comp in middle market, it seems like your deterioration was overstated sequentially year-over-year by Q1, Q2 adjustments. So any way that you can do it \u2013 the 300 basis points plus sequential increase, how much of that was catch up for comp? Doug Elliot : So, Bob, the 3.5 points of change occurred over the three quarters, primarily the last two quarters because Q1 didn\u2019t change much. And essentially half of that change was in Q2 and half of it in Q3. So in our Q3 change of a couple of points, two thirds of that change would have related to the first two quarters of the year in terms of impact in the quarter. Bob Glasspiegel : Okay. And that\u2019s just within comp. So overall you take \u2013 comp was 75% of the deterioration I think you said. Doug Elliot : I don\u2019t know if I said that. I\u2019ll go back and think about that math. But I did say that our other lines are essentially holding and comp is the only line that we\u2019ve made an adjustment to in the current accident year primarily. Beth? Bob Glasspiegel : Great. I\u2019ll follow up with Sean afterwards. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Reitenbach from KBW. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Sean Reitenbach : Hi. Thank you. How well can you incorporate the trend of inexperienced workers into workers\u2019 comp underwriting and pricing going forward? Doug Elliot : Good question. We certainly can ask the questions of our prospective clients and renewable clients how fast they\u2019re growing on the payroll side, how many new workers do they expect? So you can get a sense by looking at their payroll and their sales projections, et cetera. Sean, we\u2019re trying to do all that and more today as we speak kind of leaning into this environment trying to understand where those sectors and those clients are that need a little more rate if they\u2019ve got a lot of inexperienced at the desk level or at the machinery level. Sean Reitenbach : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. My second question on the Personal Lines other agency book, is that something you guys are looking to turn around growth in or should we expect that book to keep shrinking? Doug Elliot : Yes, I think it\u2019s the latter, Sean. It\u2019s a book we have. We don\u2019t want to call it runoff or discontinued per se but it\u2019s probably \u2013 AARP has got 100% plus of our attention in energy going forward. Sean Reitenbach : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Sabra Purtill for some closing remarks. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. We appreciate that you all joined us today and we look forward to seeing you in the future. If you have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to follow up with the Investor Relations team. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. 2018 was another great year at The Hartford. We had numerous accomplishments including excellent financial results despite a second consecutive year of high catastrophe losses. Full-year 2018 net income was $1.8 billion, and core earnings were $1.6 billion or $4.33 per diluted share, up 58%. The core earnings ROE for the year was 11.6%, well in excess of our cost of capital. With the exception of catastrophe losses, business metrics were in line or better than our outlook. Group Benefits had an outstanding year, with better than expected disability experience and investment income. Commercial Lines delivered strong results, including superb small commercial underwriting performance, new business production, and retention. The Commercial Lines underlying combined underlying combined ratio improved about 50 basis points to 91.5, among the best in the industry. Personal Lines results were negatively impacted by two hurricanes and the largest U.S. wildfire loss in insurance industry history. However, the underlying Personal Lines combined ratio of 91.2 was in line with our outlook, and two points better than 2017. New business levels were up in Personal Lines this year, which was a key goal that aligns with our AARP objectives. This partnership, which is approaching 35 years, is truly unique and collaborative. We provide their membership with unique products and quality service, and we are working together to grow the book with a focus on AARP's younger cohort, ages 50 to 60. In addition to financial results, I am pleased with our effective and consistent operational execution in 2018. We continue to make investments in people, processes, and technology, enhancing service quality and speed. Our customers and distribution partners value the enhanced digital capabilities, broader product offerings, and an expanded risk appetite that we are bringing to them. Net promoter scores continue to climb, in claims quality ratings are strong. This year, we also made progress on our innovation agenda, including the launch of the small business innovation lab located in New York City, and the purchase of Y-Risk, a company specializing in the sharing in and demand economy. Finally, major strategic activities in 2018 included the sales of Talcott, substantial progress on the integration of Group Benefits, and the announcement of The Navigators acquisition. Related to the acquisition, yesterday, we announced the new operating model and organizational structure in the formation of a new global specialty business. This structure aligns with The Hartford's Commercial Lines businesses with The Navigators U.S. and global operations, and will optimize underwriting experience and distribution relationships. Integration planning is well underway, and the new teams will be out in the market quickly after closing. In addition to its strategic contributions, we expect it to generate an attractive financial return with incremental annual core earnings before amortization of intangibles of approximately $200 million within four to five years after closing. In 2019, we will build on our accomplishments and momentum. Doug will cover the outlook for key business metrics in more detail, but I have a few macro observations. Overall, we expect our businesses to perform well. U.S. economy remains in a relatively strong position compared to Europe and other parts of the world. That said we expect some slowdown in the U.S. economy. In addition, with Brexit still unresolved, volatile equity and bond markets, slowing global growth, and continued uncertainty about global trade and tariffs, previous tailwinds maybe become headwinds particularly for investment performance. In P&C, generally, we expect underwriting margins and earnings to remain strong in 2019. With lower catastrophe losses, we expect Personal Lines to improve and underlying margins to remain healthy. In Commercial Lines, we expect underlying margins to remain very attractive, but with some modest pressure on workers' comp. Finally, we expect the Group Benefits core earnings margin to remain very strong, although slightly down from 2018 due to lower projected limited partnership returns consistent with our long-term view. For 2019, our strategic priorities remain consistent and we will strive to maintain core earnings ROEs well above our cost of equity capital. Achieving this, along with growing book value excluding AOCI and dividends per common share will drive long-term shareholder value creation. Turning to operational goals, expanding product capabilities and risk appetite remain key pillars of our strategy. With the recent acquisitions, we will have what we need, and will be intensely focused on realizing the combined potential, including deepening distribution relationships and meeting a broader array of customer needs. In addition to product depth and breadth, our strategy also emphasizes customer focus and talent management, as well as building capabilities that make us an easier company to do business with. We take pride in our ability to attract and retain talent and having a diverse and inclusive workforce with a strong ethical culture. We are consistently recognized for leadership in these areas, including being designated the World's Most Ethical Company for the past 10 years by Ethisphere and a member of the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year. Recently we were named a Best Employer for Women by Forbs in their first ranking on gender equality. Finally, we expect our organic capital generation to remain strong in 2019 and beyond, which will help fund the $1 billion share repurchase authorization we announced yesterday. Beth will discuss our approach in using the plan, but I want to emphasize that our capital management philosophy has not changed. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and will continue to balance investing in the businesses for profitable growth, with returning excess capital to shareholders that exceed business requirements. To conclude, 2018 was an excellent year, and I'm really pleased about our operating performance and execution mindset. We are working hard to maintain and expand the momentum of progress and look forward to sharing the results with you. Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. 2018 was an excellent year for Property & Casualty and Group Benefits. Each of our business units delivered strong underlying financial performance, and operationally we continue to hit aggressive targets on our major initiatives. It was an outstanding year for Group Benefits. We're meeting or exceeding all milestones for the Aetna integration. Sales were very strong, and we delivered a year of record core earnings. In Commercial Lines, we continue to set the bar for superior customer service and underwriting performance among small businesses. Our middle market industry verticals are gaining traction, and with the acquisition of Navigators we are poised to deepen our relationships with customers and brokers with an expanded product suite and new underwriting expertise. In Personal Lines, our underwriting auto results were strong, and the business is better positioned for both auto and home new business growth in 2019. This is the second year in a row marked by severe wildfire losses and hurricane activity. Our claims team and our entire enterprise continue to respond with care and professionalism in the aftermath of these tragic events. However, the losses were significant to our fourth quarter results. We continue to evolve our catastrophe risk management strategies based on the loss events in recent years with increased focus on wildfire. This includes refinement of our loss models, exposure limits, underwriting guidelines and risk transfer arrangements. While we are generally pleased with how our overall book of business and risk management program performed given the cat events of 2018, we will continue to refine our wildfire and tornado, hail catastrophe underwriting approach. Let me pivot now to summarize our financial performance for 2018. And then I'll conclude with some thoughts about 2019. Beginning with Group Benefits, we posted core earnings for the year $427 million, up $193 million from 2017 with a core earnings margin of 7%. This outstanding performance relative to our outlook was due to favorable disability loss cost trends and limited partnership income. The Group Disability launch ratio for the year improved by 3.4 points due to the emergence of favorable incident trends on the most recent accident years, and to a lesser extent slightly higher pricing. The Group Life loss ratio remained solid, but was up 1.7 points versus prior year due mainly to a mix of larger accounts from the acquisition which carry a slightly higher loss ratio. Fully insured ongoing sales for 2018 were $704 million exceeding our expectations for the year and persistency on our employer group block of business was stable at approximately 90%. This was simply an outstanding result from our sales and underwriting teams. As I noted earlier, our integration plans are on track. Our 2019 results will include approximately $85 million of our $120 million expense savings target. We expect to achieve the additional expense savings as we complete conversion of business to our new systems. Conversion of middle market and large case customers to our newly launched ability advantage claims platform has commenced and will continue throughout 2019 and 2020. The reception of our new capabilities among customers, prospects and brokers has been overwhelming positive. In Personal Lines, results for 2018 swung to a core loss of $28 million including catastrophe losses of $546 million before tax or 16.1 points versus our 2018 outlook of 5.6 points. The full-year underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development, improved 1.8 points to 91.2 driven by better results in both home and auto. The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved 1.5 points to 98.2 for the full-year driven by earn rate increases and moderate loss cost trends, partially offset by higher expenses due to increased marketing efforts. Commercial Lines core earnings were approximately $1.2 billion for the year on a combined ratio of 92.6. This includes catastrophe losses of $275 million or 3.9 points versus our outlook of 2.6 points. The underlying combined ratio is 91.5 for the year, improving 0.5 point over 2017, driven by general liability and commercial auto. The underlying combined ratio for Standard Commercial Lines worker's compensation was generally in line with 2017, which was a very strong result given the competitive market and recent loss trends. Renewal Written Pricing and Standard Commercial Lines was 2.1% for the full-year, down 1.1 points from 2017, driven by worker's compensation. Fourth quarter 2018 renewal written pricing was down sequentially from third quarter driven largely by small commercial worker's compensation. Overall, I am very pleased with how effectively our team is balancing growth and profitability. We continue to be confident in our ability to manage worker's compensation loss cost trends despite the slight uptick in frequency we have noted in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, we began to see those trends flatten. Accordingly, we made no changes this quarter to our worker's compensation loss fix for accident year 2018. This flattening suggests that 2018 may have been one-time step change as the economy adjusts to recent growth and record employment levels. Shifting to other business units, Small Commercial had another outstanding year. The underlying combined ratio was 87, improving 8/10th of a point from prior year. Retentions remained strong and new business increased to $637 million for the full-year, up 7%. Total written premium increased 1%. In middle market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 96.1 for the year, essentially flat with 2017. The slight loss ratio increase was more than offset by a lower expense ratio and a decrease to policyholder dividends. Retentions remained solid and new business production of $553 million was up 14% versus prior year. Total written premium increased by 5%, achieving positive results from our investments in new industry verticals, and efforts to improve our underwriting process, which allows our underwriters to focus on building a strong new business pipeline while making appropriate risk decisions. In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio was 97.5, 3/10th of a point lower than 2017 driven by an improved expense ratio. Total written premium was up 2%. In national accounts, our underlying combined ratio improved by three points primarily due to a lower expense ratio. Bond delivered consistent underwriting results and 4% written premium growth. And in financial products, our middle market centric platform delivered strong written premium growth of 8%. Before I turn things over to Beth, I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2019. In Group Benefits, we remained focused on successfully converted customers to our newly deployed ability advantage claims system. This platform is a distinctive capability that puts us at the forefront in using data and analytics to better manage disability and workplace absence. January is off to a solid start with renewal retention and new sales on par with prior year. For the full-year, we expect the Group Benefits for our earnings margins to be between 6% and 7%. In Personal Lines, we will continue to drive new business growth in AARP Direct. For 2019, we expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 97.5 to 99.5 including six-and-a-half points of catastrophes. In Commercial Lines, our top priority for 2019 is the successful integration of navigators into our business operations to accelerate our strategy. However, my comment this morning provides 2019 insights regarding the current commercial business of the Hartford. Across the marketplace, we continue to see varied competitive conditions based on line of business, geography, and industry. In property, general liability, commercial auto, we expect renewed risk pricing to be generally consistent with 2019. In worker's compensation, we expect pricing to be flat to down modestly. With '18 accident year frequency flattening in the fourth quarter, we believe this continues to be a very manageable level of pricing change, and while our margins may compress slightly, profitability for the line remains attractive. As a result, we expect 2019, Commercial Lines combined ratio to be between 94.5 and 96.5 including three points of catastrophes generally consistent with our performance for 2018. Overall, 2018 was a strong year for all of our business units across property and casualty and Group Benefits. We're a disciplined underwriting organization committed to maintaining strong margins and seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. We continue to effectively segment our business to determine those accounts that need price increases to reach target markets as we balance growth and margins. 2019 represents a new and significant Phase in our journey. With our acquisition of navigators, we are well-positioned to advance the key elements of our strategy, profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our distributors, and outstanding value to our customers. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover results for the investment portfolio Hartford Funds and Corporate and also comment on the announced share repurchase authorization. The investment portfolio continues to perform very well. Net investment income was $457 million for the quarter up 16% from the prior year quarter. Net investment income of $1.8 billion was up 11% for the year primarily due to higher partnership income and higher invested assets. The increase in invested assets was driven primarily by the Group Benefits acquisition and receipt of proceeds from the sale of Talcott Resolution. For the year, limited partnerships generated a 13% return primarily due to strong private equity results and gains from real estate partnerships versus our outlook of 6%. The total portfolio yield for the full-year was 4% and excluding LPs was 3.7% both flat with 2017. During the year, the average reinvestment rate rose to 4% from 3.5%, which reflects the impact of higher interest rates. However, this increase was offset by the lower yield on the invested assets acquired from Aetna after giving effect to the purchase accounting requirements to record the portfolio on the acquisition date at current market yields. The after-tax portfolio yield rose from 3% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2018, driven primarily by the decrease in the corporate tax rate. The credit performance of our investment portfolio remains very strong with net impairments losses of only $1 million for the year. During the year, we repositioned the acquired Aetna portfolio to align with our long-term portfolio model, which generated in modest amount of capital losses due to the increase in interest rates since that portfolio was acquired. Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings were up 3% for the quarter, and 37% for the year, reflecting a lower corporate tax rate, and for the full-year higher average daily assets under management. Although markets were down in the fourth quarter, our investment performance remained strong with 68% of our funds beating peers on a five-year basis. Given the significant market volatility in the fourth quarter and consistent with industry trends, net flows were negative and totaled $1.7 billion. For the year, net outflows were $300 million as mutual fund outflows of $1.7 billion were offset by EPS inflows of $1.4 billion. The corporate core loss was $46 million for the quarter and $233 million for the year. For the fourth quarter, the core loss is modestly lower than the prior year due to lower interest expense and higher net investment income. For the quarter, Talcott Resolution did not have a significant impact on earnings since investment management fees transitioned service revenues and income from our retained equity interest offset the cost of providing investment management in transition services. Corporate net investment income totaled $26 million in the quarter. Once we close the Navigators acquisition, pro-forma quarterly corporate net investment income would decrease by about $15 million. At December 31, Holding Company Resources totaled $3.4 billion, which declined to $2.9 billion at January 31, after repayment of $413 million of maturing senior notes and quarterly dividend and interest payments. After the payment of $2.2 billion for the Navigators acquisition which includes transaction expenses, Holding Company Resources will be close to our liquidity target of 12 months projected interest and dividend expense or approximately $700 million. In the fourth quarter, we completed our Annual Asbestos and Environmental Reserve Review. The four sessions to the adverse development cover we have in place, net reserves increased by $238 million before tax comprised of $167 million for asbestos liabilities and $71 million for environmental. Since inception of the adverse development cover, including the impact of the 2018 study, we have ceded losses of $523 million, compared to a limit of $1.5 billion. There are additional detail on our ANI reserves and the adverse development cover in the appendix of the slide deck. To summarize, fourth quarter core earnings were $0.78 per diluted share, down 4% from last year, while full-year 2018 core earnings were $4.33 per diluted share up 58%. Aside from catastrophe losses, our actual business results were in line or better than the ranges we provided last February. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI rose 12% for the year to $39.40, and our 2018 core earnings ROE was 11.6%, a strong result in light of heavy catastrophe losses for the year. Total value creation, which includes both the change in book value per share, excluding AOCI and dividend paid to shareholders was 15%. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2018 with a debt to capital ratio, ex-AOCI of 24.2%, down almost four points from year-end 2017. Including the preferred stock, we issued in November, our debt and preferred stock total capital ratio ex-AOCI was 25.9%, and our rating agency debt to total capital ration was 29.2%. Our goal is to keep the debt leverage within the low to mid 20% range. Between the January debt repayment and the assumption of the Navigator senior note as part of the acquisition, we expect net debt reduction of about $150 million in 2019. Finally, we are pleased to announce a share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, effective through December 31st, 2020. We expect to use this plan with discretion taking into consideration the amount of excess capital as well as the timing of future sources and uses of holding company resources. Given our projected cash flows, which were summarized on page seven of the slide deck, we would expect most of this program to be utilized in 2020. As noted earlier, upon closing the Navigators acquisition, holding company resources will be close to our liquidity targets. As holding company resources build in 2019 from subsidiary dividends, utilization of NOLs and AMT refunds, we will have some flexibility to utilize a portion of the authorization this year. To wrap up, 2018 was an excellent year for The Hartford despite high catastrophe losses. In addition to posting strong financial results, we achieved important operational and strategic goals, including the sale of Talcott and a smooth integration of the Aetna book of business. In 2019, we are focused on continuing our momentum with the goal of maintaining and improving, where possible, strong margins and top line growth. We are intently focused on maximizing the potential of the two acquisitions in Group Benefits and with Navigators, and are excited about the opportunities we see to continue to build and strengthen our position as a leading property casualty and group benefits insurance company. I'll now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. We have about 30 minutes for questions today. Shelby, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question? Operator : Of course. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. A couple of quick here for you, first, Doug, I'm just curious, your commercial auto results are much better than the rest of the industry. Do you think that's just something to do with like mix of business? Why do you think that is why others are seeing some issues with it right now? Doug Elliot : Brian, so commercial auto has been a focus of ours for, Chris and I talked last night, at least five years. We had some signs in our book five to six years ago that were acceptable to us, so we worked on closing down some programs. We've been working great, hard. Again, our commercial auto book is largely the compliment to our middle market strategy in small commercial. So, it has been a core priority of ours. Keep in mind we're still not pleased, and don't think we've reached the end zone on where our returns are today in commercial auto, but they are much improved from where they were a couple of years ago, and we'll continue to work at the line as we close up 2018. I feel very satisfied, confident in our reserve calls on the prior years. Brian Meredith : Great. And then if I take a look at your outlook for the underlying commercial combined ratio here going forward, A, you've mentioned you're factoring in some deterioration in workers' comp. Any offsets there that we could be thinking of, like in the general liability or improvement in commercial auto. How should we be thinking about how your book should play out here? Doug Elliot : Yes, it's a good question. So, yes, we expect some margin compression in the comp, but we also think that we're going to see improved results across general liability, property, and again we're going to work great, and we think we can improve our auto book as well. So, rate and underwriting attacking those three other lines, I think we're going to see an improved number for performance in 2019. And I think that'll offset some of the workers' comp compression. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple for Beth. The first one is looking at stat earnings and sources for dividends over the next couple of years. It looks like really strong stat earnings here. Should we think about if you have another like $400 million of stat earnings in Group Benefits, $1.1 billion in P&C, that's higher than what you've guided to for divvies, did all of that translate to the higher dividend of the Holdco income over the next couple of years or would some of that upside be holding in the subs. I'm just trying to understand how that maps to what could be deployable. Beth Bombara : Yes, it's a great question. So, when we do our projections for dividend to the holding company we do tend to look at sort of over the long-term what we've seen from a performance perspective so that we have a strong degree of confidence that even if business activities are a little different from our outlook, that those dividends can still come to the holding company. So, over time, if we see those businesses performing strongly we could expect to see increase in dividends in outer years, but we try and go into our planning period putting some degree of looking at just kind of historically what we've seen there. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then just trying to get a better feel for the run rate in corporate once you've closed the acquisition, I think you said that the net investment income is going to come down a decent clip, but I would think there might be some other positive offsets to that. I mean is there any way you can help me in terms of what the run rate is once we're done with this? Beth Bombara : Sure. Yes, it can be a little complicated when you look at the line item by line item view of corporate. But I think if you step back from it there's really two primary drivers of our results in corporate. The first is going to be interest expense after tax and our preferred dividend. So, if you look at 2019, we'd expect that to be about $230 million and you'd expect to see that pretty ratable over the four quarters. And then on investment income it's really going to be a function of just what cash we have at the holding company. So again, right now it's a little elevated. I'd expect that to come down, and we're probably more in the $10 million to $15 million range for invested income. And those are really the two primary drivers of what you see in corporate. There obviously is other activities as it relates to the investment management fees that we get from managing the assets of Talcott, but those are pretty much offset by the cost of performing those services, so there's not a lot that drops the bottom line on that. And then the last item I'd point to us obviously we'll be picking up our share of our interest in Talcott, the 9.7% ownership that we have, and like obviously that can vary. So when I put all that together and you sort of look through it, kind of getting to more normalized run rate and investment income, you're looking at a loss per quarter in the $45 million to $50 million range. Ryan Tunis : Thanks so much. That's helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. My first question, going back to the Commercial Lines' outlook for the coming year, and then just trying to drill down a little bit more into the commentary on comp, so it sounds like you guys are expecting stable frequency trends, continuation of what you saw in the fourth quarter. And so can you just expand, is that something you expect within both the small commercial and the middle market book, and were the trends more or less in line within both of those books in the fourth quarter? Chris Swift : Elyse, improvement in frequency in both middle and small in the fourth quarter, and very stable, so pleased about that, and we're expecting that to continue into 2019, so I think you've got a fair summary of what we see moving out relative to frequency. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, and then what should we, from the outside, pay attention to? What do you think it would take for frequency trends to turn negative again or is it just kind of more or less paying attention to any changes in the unemployment rate? Chris Swift : Well, we're spending a lot of time paying attention to unemployment for sure. We're watching job growth; we're watching all the economic indicators, including sales. As we look out, we're obviously managing our book of business by territory, et cetera, but class, we're looking for high-growth industries, we're being very careful about how we price forward. So I think the general categories that I talked about in the third quarter call are all key areas that we're focused on. We're also spending a lot of time in our claim group making sure that we're doing everything possible with nurse case managers, managing major medical, our managed care networks; we're spending a lot of time because we think we have been able to bend the curve. We think our durations in comp are top of market, and the combination of sound underwriting and excellence in claims, think it's a really good formula for us to compete moving forward. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then my second question is related to capital. The disclosure on the slides is very helpful. Beth, in terms of the cash tax receipts, that $600 million to $700 million, seems like that's going to be a big driver of capital to the hold co to finance what you might repurchase in 2019. Could you give us a sense of timing there? And then I think you said in your prepared remarks that you guys are now looking to keep about one-time interest and dividends at the hold co. I thought in the past that was one to one-and-a-half times, so if you guys okay going forward kind of keeping that at about one time? Beth Bombara : Yes. So, agree, I'll take both of those questions. So, on the tax receipts in '19, they're coming from two sources. One would be a refund that we're due relative to our AMT credits, and those AMT credits, and those we'll receive shortly after we file our tax return. So, we typically file our tax return in the third quarter. We'll obviously look to see if there's things we can do to speed that process up, but that's dependent on that. And then the NOL, the way that that works through our tax sharing arrangements with the subsidiaries is we true up quarterly kind of where we are vis-\u00e0-vis estimates of taxable income, so there's a source of cash flow that's kind of coming in each quarter related to that. And when you think about the projection that we have for tax receipts that we shared, I'd say a little bit more than half of that is from NOLs, with the remainder coming from AMT. And then for holding company resources, yes, in the past we've talked about one to one-and-a-half times. We've been grading down to one time as sort of the risk profile of the company itself has changed, and so again that's a target. It's not an absolute amount, but we feel comfortable being able to maintain holding company liquidity there as we sort of assess all of our access to liquidity across the company. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning. First question is a follow-up to Brian's question about underlying commercial margins. Were non-catastrophe losses materially above or below expectations for the full-year '18? If they were, could you offer some clarification. Doug Elliot : Let me take that, Mike. For the year, our non-cat losses in property were pretty much on our expectations. I would say in our middle market business, slightly elevated to our normal pattern, so something that's got our attention, but nothing more than that, and then in small commercial had a very good year. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great. Thanks, Doug. And then a follow-up for Beth on investment income excluding limited partnership returns. And thanks for all the color on the call so far about the corporate segment. But my question is, if I look at the new money reinvestment rate, it ticked up 30 basis points this quarter. And I was curious if that's sustainable into 2019? Beth Bombara : And I'm assuming your question is on overall portfolio yield, not just in corporate. But as we look at where we ended the year and what our yield was on an ex-partnership basis before tax for 2018. We'd expect to see maybe some increase to that as we go into '19. And obviously to your point, we'll be really dependent upon just where reinvestment rates end up being for the full-year, but we're expecting to see a slight increase there. Mike Zaremski : Okay, thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Hey, Doug, I just want to be clear that I understand your comments on workers' comp frequency. I think you said they flattened out in 4Q. So, does that imply that they recovered from the elevated levels from 3Q or were they consistent with 3Q levels? Doug Elliot : Yes, I'm sorry. Let me be very specific. The fourth quarter compare, which did flatten out, so I'm talking zero would have been a compare to fourth quarter of '17, okay. Every time we do our quarterly comparison we're looking at same quarter last year, so that would've been an improvement over the prior several quarters where we had positive frequency change, meaning more workers' compensation claim losses in the quarters compared to the same quarter prior year. Tom Gallagher : Got you. So, from what you can see, it does look like that was a temporary increase, and now you think it's more likely to trend where it's recovered to in 4Q. Doug Elliot : Our thought process that we've shared externally that it looked to us like '18 was going to be a bit of the step change, '17 was a terrific year, maybe the best year we've seen in quite some time in comp. The absolute level now that we expect moving forward, probably looks more like '16 than '17, but at this point we don't see something further deteriorating from the earlier part of the year, and we're watching the economy, as I said before, very closely. Tom Gallagher : Got you. And then my follow-up is just on Group Benefits. I'm not sure if I caught this correctly, but I thought I heard you say Group Benefit sales were strong in the quarter. And I noticed they were down a lot year-over-year. So I just want to know what you meant by that. Doug Elliot : Yes. I was really referring, Tom, to the full-year. We felt very good about the full year. As you know a lot of the Group Benefit sales they lean into the first half of the year. So I feel very good about the overall effort particularly way they are writing a book. And then I did comment further about the beginning of '19 which we feel pretty good about. And when I say, \"Pretty good,\" we have some nice successes. We had a paid family leave at new case that came out on all 1/1/18. So when I adjust for that and look at our core disability and core life sales, I feel very good about 2019. Beth Bombara : I think the only thing I would add to that, Doug, is when you look at the year-over-year compare for the quarter, in the prior year we had a very strong one case sale that skewed the results when you look at it sort of year-over-year. Tom Gallagher : But if you -- and thanks for that color, and I guess, as you think about momentum for top line you know, would you say it's a good setup for sales, persistency, and also I would be curious what you are seeing on rate. Only because your results have been so strong, I am wondering if you have give back something on price right now. Doug Elliot : So many of our accounts are rated on their own experienced base, so it really is a case-by-case answer for much of our national account book, but let me just step back. We feel really good about these last 15 months as it pertains to how the Aetna book has combined the talent, the ability for us now to stand up a very different unique claims platform. So, yes, I am feeling very bullish about our ability to compete in the marketplace. There are situations where we are giving back a little bit of rate because of the performance. There are also some cases that need a little bit more rate. And we have been able to achieve that. So I think a really strong year in '18 and off to a good start in 19. Chris Swift : Tom, I would just add from a top line orientation; remember, we've built over the last three years a voluntary capability. We've had added some new A&H products and refreshed some old one. We are doing things differently and creatively with some distribution relationships on the A&H side. So, we still think there is a momentum and upside potential from here. But it is competitive marketplace as you well know. There is lot of good competitors out there. But I think the agency brokers we deal with and the clients recognize that we've really upped our game. And we're seeing opportunities particularly in large case side we wouldn't have seen years ago. So we put it altogether particularly how the models and how actual results are performing compared to our purchase expectations, it been rock solid. Tom Gallagher : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neil. Paul Newsome : Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what appears to be some growth streams in the Personal Line side, and is there certain arc where we can see some of that stream reduced and the timing of that? Doug Elliot : Paul, let me give you some color. So as I think about our return to growth in Personal Line, number one, we are very pleased with the progress on the profitability front. Our new sales in Personal Lines were up as you can see in the chart materially from last year. We expect more of that moving forward. Our direct ARP auto sales in the fourth quarter new to new 4Q to 4Q were up roughly 24%. I expect more quarters like that as we move into next year. So, we are working hard as more and more of our territories are rate adequate to compete in the marketplace appropriately. And I think that continued trend is within our side and certainly expectations for 19. Paul Newsome : So kind of for the foreseeable future the thought, okay, that's my only question. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you, and first -- highlight Chinese New Year today. My first question is on your guidance. The combined ratio guidance is not only including Navigator acquisition, Navigator historically having higher combined ratio than Hartford's, so I just wonder would that be dilutive to your like your combined ratio going forward? And what's your plan in that $200 million earnings targeting four to five years included some improvements in underwriting in Navigator? Chris Swift : Yes, Kai. Thank you for the question. So you are right. It doesn't include that we have been clear, Beth and I and Doug that once we close, we will update our guidance. So as we think about the $200 million of incremental core earnings before amortization in tangibles, I think we have laid out a path and a track that we have talked about before. And that basically 50% of that incremental increase will come from investment income and expense saved. A quarter of that incremental increase will come from what I would just describe as profit improvement opportunities in their book of business. And the other quarter would come then from synergies cross sell activities is how we would go to the marketplace. I would share and then Doug could add to his color that obviously he has announced the operating model and the organizational structure, but doing all that work getting to know the Navigator's team both domestically and internationally we have made trips there going back this weekend to London. I am coming away more and more impressed with the challenge, the skills, the deep underlying knowledge they have in the organization. I think just as a larger company, I think we can bring them more capabilities from the technology side, the management routine side while still being entrepreneurial, while still having a distributor decision making model. So I feel even more confident that this is going to fit like hand and glove going forward, Kai. Kai Pan : That's great. Then in the past, you have been providing the P&C net income guidance as well core earnings from Group Benefits, any insight you can provide there? Beth Bombara : Yes. So on Group Benefits I will start with that, actually our practice has typically been to show margin. Last year, we did earnings just because with the Aetna acquisition we felt that it would be clear to just to give an earnings target rather than a margin. So we are actually returned for Group Benefits to our normal practice. And then for P&C investment income, we concluded that just hasn't been an area of -- an area that we needed to highlight that. I think people's model are pretty consistent on that. And as I answered previously as we look at investment returns ex-partnership, we would expect the yields to be maybe slight above last year. And then again as a reminder, when we think about yield on partnership we budget sort of assuming a long-term view of around a 6% yield. Obviously, we are much higher than that this year. But we would not project that in the subsequent year. Kai Pan : Great. Well, thank you so much. Beth Bombara : Shelby, next question please. Operator : I am sorry. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : Good morning everybody. Looking at the guidance on the Personal Line side from where it was a year ago, it deteriorated a little bit. And if I look at auto over the last three years, seems like you have had 28% rate increases. I am kind surprised given that some of your competitors are reporting declines in frequency or what not that the combined ratio is better at this point in time. Do you have any thoughts there? And also if we can talk about the change in the catastrophe outlook, you obviously have a higher cat loss ratio than you did a year ago. Has there been change about the underwriting or you are just like saying, look, there is lot more losses there in fields these days? Doug Elliot : Josh, okay, let me take them in each of the pieces and then Beth and Chris can come over the top. So relative to the Personal Lines -- all in Personal Lines, the first thing I would say is that it really was an outstanding non-cat homeowners' year. So our performance far exceeded really the last three years - five years et cetera. So, as we think about that moving forward, our pick on homeowners was a longer-term year which wasn't quite as positive as the outstanding year in '18 that we had. Relative to auto, we are watching the line. As you know, we work hard at that line over time. We are also spending more dollars on the marketing side. So, you are seeing a little bit of expense move there that is direct and something that we want to do to stimulate new sales. So, we are very sensitive to where the overall performance in the line is. Feel very solid about our picks for accident '18 and '17, so I think we're in a good spot. But as we move into '19, you're going to feel a little marketing, and then we'll watch how pricing and loss trend move together. I would note that others and including industry data has seen a little pickup in collision severity, so it's something that we're watchful of. Our book isn't demonstrating the trends at fast track data is showing, but we're clearly watching that carefully as things like new bumpers and you know, headlights, the replacement of those parts, I think is starting to kind of work its way into last trend in Personal Lines auto. Chris Swift : Josh, and again between Beth and myself, we're looking hard at our historical catastrophe numbers in over the last 10 years, five years, in particular, and we decided to make an adjustment, because I think the trends were sort of undeniable, particularly from not only wildfire, which created all the attention the last two years, but winter storm activity, tornado, hail, you know, particularly, hail patterns moving, which I described in a non-meteorological sense eastward, you know, away from mountains more and more. So we did make a slight adjustment, I think it translates into roughly $50 million pretax, but again I think that the patterns are there. We adjust to it. I think it's more realistic, and ultimately, we need to begin to price and collect cash from the policyholders, but as you know regulators have a say in that. So it'll be baked into our pricing models going forward and then it's a matter of trying to collect from policyholders over a longer period of time. Josh Shanker : Thank you for the answers and let's hope for fewer catastrophes next year nonetheless. Chris Swift : Understand. Operator : Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Good morning. Chris, in your opening statement comments, you said that you were expecting a bit of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in 2019, how does that factor into your commercial margin expectations in general and into worker's comp in particular? Chris Swift : That's a great question. As Doug described, I think it does take some of the pressure off of frequency. Again, I think the analysis that we've done in here as it relates to tax benefits, economic demand, unemployment, I think we pulled a lot of economic activity forward with the stimulus, and I think that crated a surge of workers particularly new and inexperienced workers in certain industries. And I think in a strange sense, a slight slowdown -- we still see positive GDP in the 2.25% range, I'm looking at Brion Johnson our head of HIMCO, and -- yes, so, I think that takes some pressure off. If Doug didn't say it, I mean, we still are always going to be conservative with our severity picks in putting up long-term trends on medical severity in particular. So we think that's generally unchanged by economic activity and sort of separate. But Doug, what would you add? Doug Elliot : Well, maybe as I think about adding something and the earlier questions maybe an example that just came across my desk a couple of days ago of what -- when I talk about increased economic activity and sometimes the pressure that puts on workers comp. I saw a claim come across, essentially it was a manufacturing client we've had for many years. Their demand to British product has grown substantially in the last nine months. So they took a piece of equipment that had been offline for five to seven years, put it back online and the third day it was in service not noticing that the safety guard was not attached. You know, we had a major hand-arm accident with a worker and that's the kind of claim -- that piece of equipment was not in use during what I would say level demand times over the last three to five years. And now with -- you know, in certain sectors, a little bit of needed increase in output, we had a loss that we might not have had last year or the year before. That's just a little example of why we're watching this economic activity so carefully. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. That's helpful, and then maybe a follow-up to your answer to Josh's question on catastrophes. I did note that you reduced the limit per occurrence, but also reduced the attachment point for aggregate. Does that just -- as you're looking at your cat loss experience over the last couple of years, does that just signify that you're expecting maybe more of a frequency uptick, and not necessarily a deterioration in severity per occurrence? Chris Swift : Yes, I think your observations are right. I think, if you look at our pattern, I think it was two, three years ago, Beth, we added an aggregate protection in a more material and meaningful way, you know, to project -- to protect on multiple occurrences as opposed to just one big one. So we think about spend and trying to maximize coverage on a power versus aggregate cover. We spent a little bit more on an aggregate. So again I would say it's a modest change, nothing major, Beth, but would you add any color? Beth Bombara : No, I'd agree with that. You know, one thing to keep in mind is the layer on our per occurrence treaty that we eliminated, was a layer that used to be able to go between either the per occurrence treaty, or the aggregate. And really all we've done is now put it into the aggregate, and increased the aggregate protection by another $25 million from what we had before. So really again, to your point as we look at our experience and where we see the potential for protection, we felt that that was a better use of our dollars. Yaron Kinar : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : Thanks for fitting me in. Two quick follow-ups, number one, just going back to the worker's comp comments, net-net I think what you're saying is that 2018 might have been a blip and the underlying CR uptick is due to the pressure on the pricing side of the equation. Can you just maybe expand on the level of pricing on comp, maybe give us some color and then talk about pricing expectations in 2019? Chris Swift : Sure, let me provide a little color. And I think the exposure in loss trends have exactly on, right, we see stability moving out ahead watchful and not moving off our long-term medical severity picks, but a flattening frequency. Relative to pricing, you know, as I said in my script I see pricing worker's comp flat to down. I think we're going to see a little more downward pressure in small commercial where we don't have the underwriting ability to deviate based on our current experiences much more group rated. So we're going to see a little more pressure minus single digits, small single digits, mid-single digits in small commercial. And then in middle market it's going to be a risk-by-risk evaluation, and again we see quite a bit of competition in the industry but I see that pricing being flat to down a couple of points as well. Amit Kumar : Got it, that's helpful. The only other question, I will end here, is -- I know this is early days on the buyback discussion, but is there any thought process based on where the stock has traded over the past few years, would there be any desire, let's say, if you get down to end of 2019 and early 2020, could there be a possibility this buyback could be frontloaded or am I getting ahead of myself, or is this going to be spread out over 2020, thanks? Chris Swift : Yes, I think, it's probably premature to speculate on trading practices. I think Beth and we've been clear, historically, we've done things on a pro rata basis, but I think with this program and the intention to sort of foreshadow two years of demand, we'd rather be just a little bit more opportunistic when we see opportunities particularly as we get into later '19. It's not without -- it's feasible, we could be active sooner, but we have obviously funding requirements and we got holding company liquidity targets that we'd like to maintain, so -- but as we get into later half of '19 and into '20, I think it would be much more opportunistic and in buying patterns, as opposed to anything, frontloaded in a large program, a onetime buying opportunity or anything more mechanical. So just expect us to be more opportunistic going forward. Amit Kumar : Thanks for that and good luck for the future. Chris Swift : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Doug, I was hoping you would talk a little bit about what you've seen over the course of 2018 and that lead to the worker's compensation reserve releases and did you see the reserve strengthening? Doug Elliot : Okay. On the worker's comp side, we continue to reflect on positive experience in our prior accident years, so as we go quarter-by-quarter, Beth and I and our team actuaries sit down, and those calls we think were appropriate given what we saw coming out of the prior year, so feel very good about our positions in all our booked action years. Relative to GL, we've seen a little bit of product liability, adverse experience in the last couple of years, so we are watchful of that, but the moves in GL for prior have largely been in the product liability area. Meyer Shields : Okay. Can you give us a sense as to the action years? Chris Swift : Say that again, I'm sorry. Meyer Shields : Which action years? Chris Swift : Yes. On the workers' comp, we are talking about the last four action years, right, '14, '15, '16, I'd have to go back and check on the GL\u2026 Beth Bombara : GL is, I believe, is probably coming from the 2015 action year. Meyer Shields : Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much. Operator : Your final question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of J.P. Morgan. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. So, most of my questions were answered, just maybe a couple, on M&A, are you still interested in pursuing acquisitions once the Navigator deal closes, or -- and if you guys, what sort of product lines or regions are the most interest? Chris Swift : Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. I would say, again in the context of how we've talked about excess capital, obviously we've said what we want to do with our excess, which is authorizing our share repurchase. We are in the final stages of integrating the Aetna book of business during 2019. So there's still more substance of work to do there, and we haven't even closed the Navigators acquisition, which we are expecting to close in March or April. So I think from a practical point as I said, I mean, we have everything we need, at least for the foreseeable future, and who knows what would happen down the road, but we wouldn't take M&A off the table per se, but something attractive that fits within our existing strategy, it's like a foremost deal or another small bolt-on opportunity, we would look at it, but we'd have to make more financial sense going forward. So that's what I would say. I mean, it's not a current focus, it's not a current priority, we have higher priorities that we need to really focus on the next 18 to 24 months, but you'll see what things looks like in two years. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just lastly on Group Benefits, the overall margins over the last couple of quarters have been pretty strong, I think the rest of the industry had seen a similar trend as well. As you went through renewal season for 2019, what was -- just a few comments on what you have seen in terms of pricing in that market? Chris Swift : It's been a pretty consistent market. It will move by account. So yes, we've had a couple of accounts with outstanding performance, and I think we've made reductions thoughtfully, but generally I think it's similar consistent markets what we have experienced over the last 12 to 15 months. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay, thank you. Operator : There are no other questions in queue. Beth Bombara : Oh, thank you, Shelby. We appreciate you all joining us today, and look forward to seeing you at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Conference next week, or at AIFA in early March, if you are attending either of those events. And as always, if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to follow-up with the Investor Relations team. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Sabra Purtill, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sabra Purtill : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We reported first quarter 2019 yesterday afternoon and posted all the earnings related materials including the 10-Q on our website. For those of you joining us live we appreciate your finding time for us on such a busy morning for earnings calls. Please note that we reported results a bit later than usual and expectation of having closed the Navigators acquisition by now. We also expect that post acquisition our earnings releases will be about a week later than on previous schedule as we complete all the financial reporting integration work which we will launch after closing. As per our usual practice we will announce our second quarter earnings release date in early July. Before introducing the speakers I wanted to draw your attention to two recent 8K filings. First, yesterday morning, Navigators filed an 8K announcing that the outside date for the acquisition has been automatically extended from May 01, to July 01, in accordance with the terms of our merger agreement which permit an extension for the regulatory approval process. The only approval we have yet to receive is from the New York Department of Financial Services and as noted in the 8-K they have been provided with all of the requested materials and information. There will be a public filing via 8-K when we receive that approval and the acquisition will close five business days after that. We would note that as a result of SEC filing requirements, even if we were to close the acquisition before May 10, Navigators will still be required to file a Form 10-Q for the first quarter financial results. Second, this morning we announced that Stephen McGill has resigned from our Board effective today as a result of the announcement that he, along with other experienced executives have launched a new insurance brokerage firm, McGill and partners. Mr. McGill's resignation does not arise from any disagreement on any matter relating to the company's strategy, operations, policies or practices. We appreciate and thank him for his service on our board. For the call today, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Bombara Costello, the Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A period. Just a few final comments before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update information or forward-looking statements provided on this call. Investors should also consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings. Our commentary today also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings, as well as in the news release and financial supplement. Finally, please note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without The Hartford's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for one year. I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday we reported first quarter core earnings of $507 million up 10% over first quarter 2018. Core earnings were $1.39 per diluted share. First quarter results were strong and all the Hartford's businesses performed well making meaningful contributions to financial results and progress toward the achievement of our strategic goals. Our core earnings ROE which is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis was 11.5%, a very strong result considering the significant level of catastrophe losses in 2018. Our annualized core earnings ROE was 13.9% for the quarter. Book value excluding AOCI rose 11% over last year to $40.79 per diluted share for total shareholder value creation of 14% including dividends. I am pleased by the growth momentum building in our segments. Commercial lines written premiums rose 5% over the prior year despite Workers' Compensation pricing headwinds. Personal lines and Group Benefits both had strong sales in the quarter and the Hartford Funds net flows were positive. Doug and Beth will cover segment results in more detail, but I wanted to highlight a few data points that illustrate the earnings power and financial strength of our franchise. Commercial lines underlying combined ratio was 92.7 in the quarter, clearly among the best in the market, while up from the prior year, it was consistent with our expectations, although loss severity in property Marine was higher than average. The expense ratio increased also consistent with our expectations due to planned investments to make us an easier company to do business with including our multiyear strategic initiatives focused on driving long-term efficiency and enhanced capabilities such as a rebuilt agency portal which enables more digital interfaces with our distribution partners. With personal lines margins much improved after recent pricing and underwriting actions, our key objective is to return to topline growth through a combination of sales and enhanced retention focused on AARP members. Our AARP partnership now in its 35th year is the cornerstone of our personal lines business. I am very pleased with the sales this quarter which were up 57% resulting from expanded marketing efforts over the last year and a half. Margins also improved. The accident year loss ratio before Cats dropped 3.3 points improving for both auto and home although substantially offset by the impact of planned marketing initiatives on the expense ratio. Group Benefits continues to deliver strong results in 18 months after closing the acquisition operational performance is proceeding extremely well. Core earnings were up 44% to $122 million which included the impact of favorable disability trends. The acquisition related integration activities remain on track and we have exceeded expense and sales targets by a good margin with persistency in line with expectations. Hartford Funds had a solid quarter. Core earnings were down from prior year because of the impact of overall market performance in the fourth quarter but were in line with our expectations. Other operational metrics were quite favorable with positive net flows and continued excellent investment performance relative to peers. Another area of significant focus this quarter was the pending acquisition of Navigators. The go to market leadership structure was announced earlier this year and the teams are well prepared to hit the ground running when the deal closes. We continue to hear very positive feedback from agents and brokers and look forward to introducing the combined teams and expanded product offerings to our top distribution partners at our annual summit meeting later this month. We are very excited about the potential of bringing the two organizations together. Near-term we are focused on achieving a timely and effective alignment of the underwriting teams which will strengthen the commercial lines' presence. In addition, we are confident that we will achieve our long-term financial objectives through a combination of improved underwriting margins, higher investment returns, higher revenue growth, and expense savings. Hartford's overall strategy is straightforward and unchanged. First, we remain focused on achieving the full potential of our product abilities and underwriting expertise with a particular focus on the integration of the acquisitions. Second, we continue to invest for the future to become an easier company to do business with including in investments in technology, data, analytics and digital capabilities that improve the experience we deliver to distribution partners and customers. Third, long-term success depends on the continued ability to attract, retain, and develop top talent. We have top decile employee engagement scores which recognize our commitment to providing attractive career opportunities in a diverse and inclusive workplace and we are proud to be recognized for our ethical culture that's recognized by [indiscernible] for the 11th time. Our financial goals to drive long-term shareholder value creation are also unchanged. First, to profitably grow our businesses while generating strong returns well in excess of our cost of equity capital. Second, to deploy excess capital acreatively in our businesses or through capital management actions, and finally to grow book value and dividends per common share over time. How we achieve these goals is also important. Every day we support our policyholders, agents, employees and communities by protecting their incomes, families and businesses in making sustainable and positive contributions to society including support of organizations like Junior Achievement, the Boys and Girls Club, the City of Hartford and our support of programs to address drug addiction. To conclude, first quarter results were strong with all business segments performing well. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain robust. I am very pleased with the first quarter results, both financially and operationally and look forward to building on our achievements during the remainder of 2019 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. This was a solid quarter for Property and Casualty and Group Benefits. Our financial results were led by outstanding earnings in Group Benefits primarily driven by favorable trends in disability. The combined core earnings of P&C and Group Benefits were above our expectations and in line with last year, as each of our business units continued to execute effectively. Let me get right into our business results. Commercial Lines first quarter combined ratio was 96.1 increasing 2.8 points versus 2018. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior-year development was 92.7 increasing 2.3 points from 2018. The deterioration was primarily due to compression in Workers' Compensation margins and higher expenses, both as expected. We also experienced higher non-catastrophe property losses which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For the quarter where no written pricing in standard commercial lines was 1.7% consistent with fourth-quarter 2018; however, March pricing excluding Workers' Comp showed an encouraging improvement over January and February. Commercial auto pricing continues to lead the way with nearly double-digit gains. Property and General Liability are in the low to mid single-digit range. Workers' Compensation remains competitive and margin pressure continues as the NCCI and other state bureaus submit negative loss costs filings. Our Workers' Compensation margins remain healthy and give us a strong foundation for competing in the marketplace. The uptick in frequency we observed early last year had begun to flatten by the fourth quarter with another 90 days of data trends continue to look favorable and we are confident in our 2018 and 2019 accident year loss ratio selections. Let me sure a few more details on our commercial businesses beginning with small commercial which had another very strong quarter posting an underlying combined ratio of 89.1. Written premium grew 4% with $185 million of new business and strong retention. As we continue to successfully convert business from the foremost renewal rights deal. Middle market had a difficult property quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 96.7 increasing 4.5 points from first quarter 2018. This is mainly due to adverse volatility and non-catastrophe property lines including inland marine which experienced several fires on large construction projects. We also had margin compression in Workers' Compensation as expected. Expenses increased driven by commissions and increased investment in technology and operations partially offset by reductions in taxes licenses and fees. Written premium increased 7% based on solid retentions and new business production of $143 million, in addition to strong performance across all lines of business in our core book we continue to see favorable contributions from our teams in energy and marine. In specialty commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2 improved 1.3 points driven by reductions in taxes, licenses, and fees, partially offset by higher underwriting expenses. Strong written premium growth of 10% was primarily driven by bond and financial products. Shifting over to personal lines, we're pleased with our performance producing an underlying combined ratio of 89.1 improving 7/10 of a point from a year ago. In first lines auto the underlying combined ratio was 93.6, six times of employment better than 2018. Loss cost trends remain within our expectations with continued negative frequencies and severity in the low to mid single digit range. New business for AARP direct to auto grew 57% for the quarter. Our higher marketing spend is delivering the expected increases in responses. Our conversion ratio has also improved driven by more competitive pricing and continuous enhancements to the sales experience. Given our improved rate adequacy, projected retentions and cost per conversion, we are pleased with the profit profile of this business. Our product, process, and pricing adjustments will continue throughout 2019 and I expect further progress in our conversion rate and new business growth. Shifting over to Group Benefits, core earnings for the first quarter was $122 million with a margin of 8%, a terrific quarter. The increase versus prior year was driven by favorable disability results, lower amortization of intangibles and reductions in taxes, licenses, and fees, offset by slightly elevated mortality in our life book of business. The lower disability loss ratio reflects favorable incidence and recovery trends across recent accident years consistent with our experience over the last several quarters. Persistency on our combined employer group block of business was steady at approximately 90%. Fully insured ongoing sales were $407 million. Overall it was another strong sales quarter across market segments and product lines with continued momentum in our voluntary product offerings. The acquisition of Aetna's Group life and disability businesses well entered the second year and we remain focused on completing all phases of the integration. Conversion of middle market and large case customers to our market-leading ability advantage claims platform has commenced and will continue into 2020. In closing, this was another solid quarter with Group Benefits continuing to deliver excellent results in the property and casually in line with our expectations for the year. We are looking forward to closing on the Navigators deal and being able to put our integration plans into action. We have been preparing to hit the ground running on day one as a combined organization with broad capabilities and deep underwriting expertise. Our combined commercial insurance solutions will be focused primarily in three areas. First, our world-class small commercial business will continue to deliver market leading products and services to the small business market and will benefit from the specialized capabilities of Navigators, particularly in the professional liability product area. Second, our middle and large commercial business will have expanded capabilities primarily adding liability products such as environmental life science and umbrella to our existing package and Workers' Compensation capabilities. And third, our global specialty business will have the breadth, expertise and scale to compete in the wholesale surety financial products and marine markets. Also our reinsurance and international capabilities will add to this product array. I know that I speak for my teammates when I say we are very excited about our future. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and corporate, and provide an update on balance sheet items and holding company resources. The investment portfolio continues to perform very well with low impairments, strong LP returns, and generally stable investment yields. Net investment income was $470 million for the quarter up 4% from the prior year quarter and impairments were $2 million before tax. Limited partnerships generated a 13% annualized return for the quarter, about double our outlook assumption but down from 19% in first quarter 2018. Real Estate Funds posted very strong performance up significantly from first quarter 2018, but relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. Private equity investment returns were also strong, but down from exceptionally high returns in the first quarter of last year. The annualized portfolio yield was 4.1% before tax and 3.4% after-tax down slightly from first quarter 2018 due to the lower returns on LPs. Excluding LPs the first quarter 2019 annualized portfolio yield was 3.7% before tax, flat with the prior year and up slightly to 3.1% on an after-tax basis. Lower interest rates in the quarter impacted net unrealized gains on fixed maturities which rose significantly from year-end to $703 million after-tax. Strong equity market performance also generated unrealized gains of $126 million after-tax which are included in net income. Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings of $28 million were down from $34 million last year primarily due to lower investment fee revenue as a result of lower average AUM. Although AUM was up 2% from the prior year and first quarter market performance was very strong, daily average AUM was down 4% from the prior year first quarter due to the impact of the year-end market levels. Other quarterly performance metrics were favorable with net positive flows of $874 million and very good investment performance. As of March 31st, 70% of Hartford Funds have outperformed peers on a five-year basis. Corporate core loss of $15 million improved by $51 million from first quarter 2018. Corporate has been more volatile the last few quarters, so we have provided a table in the slides that breaks down the key components of corporate results. The principal driver of the improvement this quarter was $22 million of net income from Hopmeadow Holdings, a holding company that purchased our former Talcott subsidiary, compared to $6 million in fourth quarter 2018 and zero in the first quarter 2018. Due to fourth quarter capital markets decline, Talcott had fairly large unrealized gains on hedges resulting in significantly higher net income all of which is included in core earnings. A second impact in corporate is net investment income earned on cash and short-term investments which are at high level due to funds held at the holding company for the Navigators purchase. Upon closing of the acquisition, holding company resources will decrease about $2.2 billion which will reduce net investment income from the first quarter run rate. Finally, interest in preferred dividends were $56 million after-tax down from $63 million in first quarter 2018 reflecting both the net reduction in debt and the issuance of preferred stock over the past 12 months. As a reminder, interest expense will increase slightly after closing due to Navigators senior notes which had $15 million of annual interest expense. In total first quarter core earnings were $1.39 per diluted share up 9% from first quarter 2018 due to higher core earnings from Group Benefits and better corporate results. Turning to the balance sheet, book value per diluted share of $38.36 grew 9% from December 31 due to net income and increases in net unrealized gains on fixed maturities. Our net income ROE was 13.5% which is based on a 12-month trailing net income and therefore includes the impact of the high catastrophe losses in the second half of 2018. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $40.79 up 4% and the core earnings ROE was 11.5% which also uses 12-month trailing earnings. Our debt leverage ratios improved this quarter with a debt to capital ratio excluding AOCI of 21.9% at March 31, down about 6 points from a year ago due to net debt reduction and growth in stock-holders equity. Our rating agency debt to total capital ratio of 25.7% was at the high-end of our targeted range. After the Navigators acquisition these ratios will increase slightly due to the assumed debt, but we expect to be back in line with our targeted range by mid-2020 due to the combination of repayment of $500 million of senior notes in March 2020 and increases in stockholder equity from earnings over the period. At March 31, holding company resources totaled $2.9 billion. At closing holding company resources will decreased by $2.2 billion for the purchase price and related expenses with the remaining balance of approximately $700 million roughly in line with our liquidity target of 12 months forward interest and dividends. Futures subsidiary dividends and tax receipts will provide the funds for our share repurchase plan which we expect to begin in the second quarter. We plan to use the $1 billion repurchase authorization with discretion and continue to expect that the majority of the program will be used in 2020. Before closing I wanted to update you on the Navigators acquisition. The regulatory approval process is nearing completion and we are expecting final approval soon. As announced yesterday upon closing we will enter into an adverse development cover with National Indemnity which will provide greater certainty about the impact of the Hartford from any potential loss development on Navigators reserves. We will pay approximately $91 million for $300 million of coverage and an attachment point that is $100 million above Navigators' December 31, 2018 carried reserves subject to the cover. The premium for the cover will be recognized upon closing in net income but not in core earnings. After closing we will update and complete our review of Navigators' reserves consistent with our indication in August that we would make adjustments to reflect our views. We intend to complete this in-depth review within 30 to 45 days of closing as we want to review the most current information on exposures and claims. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter, the lines of business in commercial lines will change, which primarily impacts middle market and specialty commercial. The three businesses in commercial lines will be small commercial, middle and large commercial and global specialty. We will provide historical restatements of our operating metrics for these businesses. To summarize, with all of our businesses performing well, we have a strong start to the year. Our goals remain consistent to maintain and improve where possible strong margins and topline growth and to achieve a timely and effective combination of our commercial lines of business with Navigators. I'll now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session. Sabra Purtill : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Amy, can you please repeat the instructions for asking the question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the adverse development cover that you guys had announced last night with Navigators. Beth, in your remarks you said that you guys have been due to the in-depth review of the reserves which you've told us about before, after the transaction closes, so I'm just trying to get a sense of how you guys came up with $300 million as being the right level for the cover that you bought with Berkshire? Chris Swift : Elyse, it's Chris. Let me just start and then I will ask Beth to add her additional color. So I think we've been pretty consistent since we announced the transaction that we always plan to apply our views and methodologies and practices to establishing a conclusion regarding ultimate losses that needed to be carried on Navigators balance sheet that was known and part of our transaction. So, ultimately as we got into it, we decided that we wanted greater certainty regarding the outcome on their loss development and obviously negotiated a deal with [indiscernible] that I think accomplishes that call. So, that philosophically was the approach and how we came up with it. But Beth, would you add anything additional? Beth Bombara : No I think that summarizes it very nicely. As Chris indicated, this was an area that we have been focused on and thought it appropriate to look into the market to see what type of protection might be available and as we look at the terms that were provided in our discussions we found them to be attractive and put the protection in place which again we believe just provides greater certainty on what the impact could be to the Hartford. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks. And then my second question on, within commercial is it possible you guys said in the prepared remarks that we got better outside of comp in March, do you have an outlook as we can think about and I know it's broad-based depending upon mine, just what price you might see within commercial for the balance of the year and what you are really seeing in loss trend kind of away from comp? And then also if you could just quantify the level of non-cash property and marine losses in the quarter, that would be great? Thank you. Doug Elliot : Elyse, good morning. Let me take the individual pieces and do my best with them. Again I would remind you the segments we play in as a core here at the Hartford rights our book is largely middle and small commercial where we probably won't see all of the amplitude that I think some of the specialty markets are feeling, but we are encouraged by what we saw toward the end of the first quarter on a noncompliance moving up into the mid single digit range as I commented on it depends upon line we still see some firming in auto for sure, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing in property and GL [ph], particularly Cat exposed property, wind areas, and other parts of the country. So, I expect that momentum to continue. Do I think it's going to be 15 or 20 someday? No I think that's outside the boundaries of where we compete, but I do think we'll see continued momentum because as you know particularly in the property side we've had rather disappointing initial results and we need to address that issue both with product and pricing. So that's how I think we're going to march quarter-by-quarter and we'll look at our book and we'll think about our risks and do a risk by risk pricing evaluation. Relative to loss trend, I would say that 90 days and or 120 days and thereabout where we thought they would be for 2019, Workers' Comp has settled in nicely, so we're pleased about what we see in frequency, the severity around medical and wages about where we expected to be, property and liability similar and auto is something that we're still working hard at improving our book. We're not at all satisfied with our book performance. So, very few surprises on the exposure front from my perspective. Beth, do you want to add anything over the top? Beth Bombara : Yes, I mean we did obviously call out in middle market that we did have some elevated non-Cat property losses and that definitely had more of an impact on the middle market combined ratios. When you kind of pull that through the total commercial lines it is probably about a point of what we saw sort of in the year-over-year compare. So I think that provides I think the question that you had on sort of what we were seeing in there. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR. Randy, your line is open. Ryan Aceto : Hi everyone, this is actually Ryan Aceto on for Randy this morning. I wanted to turn to Group Benefits last two quarters have had pretty strong margins. Is that something we could expect going forward or are we going to be coming back toward your guidance toward the end of the year? Beth Bombara : Yes, so we're very pleased with the performance that we saw in Group Benefits this quarter and as you point out the previous quarter and it really continues to be driven by favorable incidence levels on inner disability block. And when we think about it from over the long term, we do see ourselves being in the range that we provided at the beginning of the year, but obviously with these trends we're probably trending a little bit higher from the core earnings margin in the range that we provided and we'll continue to watch incidence levels as you know they're very tied to economic activity and we'll continue to make adjustments as we go through the year. But overall we're very pleased with how that book is performing and we also saw improvements in our recovery rates as well. Ryan Aceto : Great, and then I didn\u2019t see your \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed on the call, did you touch on the tax payment that was supposed to be coming through the door, I guess first quarter or may be pushed to second with timing of payments? Beth Bombara : Yes. So I think you may be referring to refund on AMT, which will come through when our tax return is finalized, but with this review by the IRS, we did file our tax return already, so we'll await to receive those receipts and the timing is somewhat dependent on the IRS process, so we did not get a receipt in the first quarter. Ryan Aceto : And you still expect 600 to 700? Beth Bombara : So again, the $600 million to $700 million is not just AMT, that's our anticipation over the course of the year. I'll remind you that we also will have tax receipts coming to the holding company as we utilize our NOLs, so our operating subsidiaries will basically pay the holding company for use of those NOLs. And we do those tax settlements with our operating subsidiaries throughout the year, beginning in the second quarter. But yes, overall for the year, we're still anticipating net proceeds of the holding company of about $600 million to $700 million. Ryan Aceto : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you. Just back on the Group Benefits discussion, I'm just curious, are you seeing any impact on pricing as a result of the favorable disability results you are coming through? Doug Elliot : Brian, I would suggest that it's a fairly competitive marketplace. It's been competitive, but clearly the disability results across the industry, including our own are in very good shape. So I think there's a bit of enhanced competition, nothing outside the norm now. Brian Meredith : Great. And then Doug, my second question is, I'm just curious, your thoughts on kind of what the market conditions are looking like right now for Navigators. You obviously know the businesses, it's there and what's going through, - do you expect you are seeing the same type of kind of pricing that we're hearing from other people out of Lloyd, et cetera and is Navigators today, maybe a little bit better than you would have thought when you actually made the acquisition or announced it? Chris Swift : Yes, Brian, it's Chris. Obviously, we haven't closed yet, so we can't speak for Navigators and what they're going to report in the first quarter. But I would say generally between Doug and myself and in all the discussions with their team that we've had over the last three, four months numerous visits to London to see firsthand some of their Lloyd's operations, I'm pretty encouraged. I think and again the deal still makes a tremendous amount of strategic sense for us and the quality of team that I am seeing there the underwriters their knowledge of the market and quite honestly the tailwinds that are really beginning to develop in certain aspects of the market, particularly where they play and domestically and in Lloyd's - is very encouraging to me and probably long overdue. But Doug, what would you add? Doug Elliot : I think the timing is terrific for us launching. Chris and I just got back from Boston. We spent a couple of days with some of our leading distributor partners and also some of our key risks and again relative to my comments, although we're seeing some upward movement in the core middle and small lines. I think the need in some of the specialty areas is a little more advanced and I expect that we're going to see that in the marketplace over the coming quarters. So I think a good time for us to come together, excited about the expertise that now will become part of The Hartford upon completion of the deal and Brian, I think you have a good start here. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh, your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you. So in terms of Navigators, we know they took probably back to $50 million to $60 million of after-tax reserves after you close the deal and you're signing the ADC with Berkshire right now and if you need the ADC that's some material deterioration in the loss reserves. Can we talk about ROI when you did this deal what you think the return is, has the return materially deteriorated? So you've looked under the wheel here, you haven't closed it yet, but has your perspective changed a little bit, has anything deteriorated from your initial perspective when you did the deal? Chris Swift : Josh, it's Chris. I would add just a couple points maybe to help you. Obviously the $70 per share price that we negotiated was negotiated price, obviously a willing buyer and a willing seller. As I said, just in the prior commentary, we still feel very good about the strategic and financial components of this transaction. So nothing fundamentally has changed. But clearly, we paid a full price for property that we're excited to own and integrate and keep its own special identity going forward as a global specialty operation, but we probably paid a price once we see their first quarter results in a book value range of 1.9, at the end of the day. But as I said in my prepared remarks, the metrics and the components of earnings that $200 million in that four to five-year period of time, remain very valid improvements in underwriting results, contributions of net investment income, cross-sell, revenue generation and expense savings. So, I feel all those points and the $200 million run rate is very achievable in that four to five-year time period and actually I think there's more improvement opportunity beyond that. That said, yes, our IRRs on the deal given what we've learned since then have probably come down a little bit, maybe a half a point and a point range. So I'm not terribly concerned about what that means for the long term. But yes, it's probably a little at the low end of our expectations as far as an IRR. Josh Shanker : Okay, I appreciate the answers. And then maybe a question for Beth on Talcott, obviously the hedges work in your favor in 4Q '18 which came through in as income in 1Q '19, I guess that's going to give back some in 2Q '19. Can you can you walk through the math we should be considering on that line item in the corporate and what we should consider as a run rate sort of income generation from the Talcott share? Beth Bombara : Sure, yes and as I'm sure you can appreciate, that's a little difficult to answer, because obviously the share that we pick up is going to have an inherent in its some volatility because of the hedging gains and to your point hedging losses when markets recover. I would say as we think about for the impact of their first quarter and what that could be in our second quarter, I would expect it to be pretty flat 0 to $3 million kind of range, definitely not at a level that we saw this quarter. And unfortunately it is just going to kind of bounce around a bit, because of that. So I think you should expect to see some noise in that line item. And I think the other line items within corporate are pretty straightforward, which is why we provided this slide that kind of summarize those, being interest income, which again will come down once we complete the purchase of Navigators and then obviously the interest in preferred dividend line. Brian Meredith : Okay, thanks for the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Paul, your line is open. Paul Newsome : Good morning and thanks for the call everyone. The - yesterday Progressive put in their shareholder letter that they are seeing a more competitive personalized market. I was wondering if you could give us a few comments on what you're seeing from a market perspective in Personal Lines and if you're seeing kind of the same thing? Doug Elliot : Paul, I would suggest that the last few years have been competitive in the Personal Line space. So I'm not sure I could contrast the last 90 days or last 180 with the prior 3 or 4, 5 years. I think the better companies are investing and are more competitive in the street or how they reach customers and so that's just the marketplace we face into every day. Obviously we are leaning into our capabilities and feeling good that we've made some progress across both the sales front and the product front, but more work to be done and understand this terrific competitors we see in the marketplace each and every day. Paul Newsome : And my second question, I was wondering if you have you any updated thoughts on the expense ratio I guess ticked up a little bit with some investments that you've made in whether or not that is something that would eventually get kicked back down to that the 30 range, that it was at one point, kind of timeline, maybe, but nothing specific? Chris Swift : Paul it's Chris. I guess, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've been very deliberate and conscious really over the last 6, 7 years since the team has been together to think about the needed investments in our internal infrastructure, technology, data analytics, claim systems and we've been on a multi-year journey that we're continuing. And I would say, yes, maybe they've spiked up a little bit here, but we've, we've been pretty disciplined and I'm really pleased with our approach of generating expense savings, over the years, expense cuts, rationalizing certain aspects of our infrastructure to invest in the new more modern technology and digital capabilities. So in the long-term trend, we still believe in to invest, have greater efficiency, a better customer experience and from any one quarter and comp basis, it could bounce around a little bit, but Beth or Doug, I still very, very committed on the path that we're on, because it's the right one for the long term. Beth Bombara : Yes, I agree with that and when we look at the expense ratio and primarily focusing on the commercial lines, we definitely saw an increase there is kind of what we see in this quarter, around that is probably where it will be for the remainder of the year and we feel very strongly and are committed to the agenda that we're on relative to the improvements that we're making in our core operations and our capabilities that we think are critical to continue to compete at the level that we compete at. Doug Elliot : I would add maybe three thoughts. One is data science has become a fundamental key initiative here in terms of looking and working with external data, working more aggressively with our internal data and thinking about how that will help us compete and be thoughtful about markets we intend to move into. And so, yes, we have clearly extended our reach and are investing more dollars in data science. But I believe there will be a long-term pay that will be more than equal to what we're spending now. So there is a bit of short-term pain for what I think will be long-term gain. Secondly, which ties into the earlier question around NAV, we have spent a lot of money and continue to invest in new products over the last 5 years, and that started with Group Benefits through the voluntary suite and now has extended into things like energy, our construction verticals, et cetera. That progress in some of those cases now gets accelerated with Navigators. So as Chris talks about expenses, the fact that we are standing up and environmental practice and standing up a life science practice now we put that on a much different speed dial. And I think they'll be cost saves there, but we have spent a lot, because we feel like that full product suite was absolutely necessary to be the player that we intend to be and needed to be in the middle market space, that's point two. And then thirdly, there is some slight upward pressure on commissions, both to defend our space in the small commercial area and also to reach into specialized practices that now, we're building products for. So we're aware of it. I think we've been thoughtful about how we pick our spots to compete long term, but I share those 3 areas as complementary to what Chris and Beth shared relative to expenses. Paul Newsome : Thank you for the questions and congrats on the quarter. Doug Elliot : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Tom, your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Just a question on the ADC deal as it relates to the way we should be interpreting this, do you think it's fair to say that if I just look at little over $2 billion acquisition price and I add the premium you're paying for the ADC plus the $100 million, up to the attachment, add an extra couple of hundred million to the purchase price, is that a fair way to think about the IRR on the transaction? So maybe it's 10% worse than you originally thought and the question then becomes, did you have 10% conservatism in your assumptions, when you priced it, can you, is that a fair way to think about this or would you make any adjustments to that? Chris Swift : Tom, it's Chris. I understand your path and your points, your math and your concepts. So I wouldn't add anything to it other than how fast the run rate to get to $200 million might change sort of the future earnings power I think is enhanced since we announced the deal. So, but as far as the basis, the investments in sort of the Navigators deal I would agree with your concepts. Tom Gallagher : Okay, thanks. And then just a followup for Doug on Group Benefits, you said retention is about in line with your expectations, and I'm looking at a couple of things going on there, flattish year-over-year earned premium and sales team down about 10% year-over-year. So just curious how has the underlying persistence you've been trending on the block, is the sales success about in line with what you expected? And then also, one other thing I noticed there. The other sales were quite strong. I think, up over 30%. I'm assuming that maybe that's Voluntary Benefits. Can you comment on what's happening there? Thanks. Doug Elliot : Yes. So just to nail that and then I'll come back around, certainly that's where our voluntary products are and we feel good about progress, not just last year and the prior, but certainly start of 2019. A couple of comments about sales, I would remind you that we had a new product, the New York Paid Family Leave Act that initiated 01/01/2018, so that was about a $50 plus million program. When you adjust for that our run rate is more reflective of my comments, which we feel pretty good about the start to 2019. So I think you need to make that adjustment. It was a one-time change with the law in New York. When I think about retention, we did build in some shock to our anticipated one, two, three-year scenarios around the Aetna deal. And so, when I think about what is playing out Chris, and I view experienced to be basically largely in line with what we expected. So, not what I would say a normalized run rate, but with little bit of shock for the first couple of years. Through that we feel pretty good about the accounts we're retaining. I feel pretty good about the setup. As you know, we're already working on the backside of 2019, so I don't think there are any major surprises that fall out of line. Chris Swift : Tom, it's Chris. As I said in my prepared remarks, from an operational side, whether it be retention, whether it be sales, whether it be expenses, all meeting or exceeding our expectations and something maybe we don't talk about too often Doug is, I think the Ability Advantage, the claims system that we inherited plus the modifications that we made and our claims expertise embedded in our organization is another key differentiator long term that we feel terrific about. Doug Elliot : I mean, Tom, you know and you understand that book. So a good chunk of that book 70% plus the Aetna book was national accounts and therefore you can have lumpy progress as you move through time, you lose one account and you need to be accounted for that. So I look back and I think our 2018 retention was really solid and I'm pretty pleased about the way we started '19 and looking forward to the rest of the year and then next year. Very excited about what we're building and how fast we brought to market a brand new claims platform and we will now compete with that going forward. Tom Gallagher : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Gary, your line is open. Gary Ransom : Yes, good morning. I have a question on the pressure you've been talking about in Workers' Comp and whether we could drill down a little bit. Are there places where you're seeing a lot more pressure, maybe in states or small versus middle and I just wanted to get a little more color on the differences you might be seeing in that line? Chris Swift : Gary, good morning. Let me make a few comments and you can direct the path forward. First comment I'd make relative to the quarter is that -- as we move through 2018, we did adjust our middle market Workers' Compensation pick. So this quarter was a little bit of a difficult compare comparing first quarter '19 to a 2018 first quarter that did not have the recorded actions that happened through the rest of the year. So I'll just start with that when you think about the all-in numbers we posted. Secondly, I've commented in the past that we have a bit more discretion in the middle market through the underwriting process where accounts have more experienced per account, they are larger size, et cetera, and therefore underwriters used to stay filings, but also have some ability to adjust based on underwriting views, engineering Workers' Compensation, safety habits, et cetera, et cetera. So, I would say to you that in the small commercial world, there is a bit less flexibility and where we see pricing more driven by market conditions, there will be a little bit more pressure on margin and in the middle we are able to do a better job at looking at looking at accounts one by one and making appropriate judgments as we move forward on the margin. Gary Ransom : Yes, just to get in on the small commercial side where you say you have less flexibility, I mean is there, if you look at the individual account level you had a new piece of business coming in and the pricing is maybe not quite where it needs to be to get the business, is can - is the facility there to quickly adjust price if you can to attract that customer? Chris Swift : Well, you're really talking about a class by class process and now you're inside the wheels of I think what makes us so effective in the marketplace. So, yes, in certain areas territories and classes have we changed the referral process, absolutely. And even inside of classes there are micro classes that we spend more time with probably have a bit different appetite and this is all on a state and regional basis. So you're now inside the granular nature of what we do day in day out inside small. I just gave you a little bit of a 50,000 feet view that says across small commercial it's a bit more of a spot rated product, given the fact that we're seeing prices go negative we're very focused on where and how that is happening and making sure that we're doing everything we can to preserve the margins we've got and to protect our future. Gary Ransom : All right, thank you very much. I just had one other little question. The $90 million of premium you're paying for the ADC is that, how is that going to be treated in terms of core versus non-core earnings? Beth Costello : Yes, so the premium that we'll pay will be in non-core, so it will not be in core earnings, but obviously will be in net income on an after-tax basis of course. Gary Ransom : All right, thank you very much. Chris Swift : Thanks Gary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer, your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great, thanks. Two really quick questions, one, the ADC premium is that going to come out of P&C or is that a corporate expenditure? In other words is it going to reflect underwriting results? Beth Costello : So it will not be reflected in underwriting results, again, similar to how we treated the ADC cover that we bought for A&E exposures a few years ago. Meyer Shields : Okay, and then this is a little nitpicky, but you've had a few consecutive quarters of adverse development in General Liability and I was hoping you could talk through what's going on there? Chris Swift : Yes, I think it's pretty picky and I think it's small. We've had a couple of older product liability cases that we've added to. It's nothing that has my attention in the way of concern. So I feel pretty good about our balance sheet. I think we finished 2018 strong, we feel good about our position and first quarter 2019 and I think we march ahead. Meyer Shields : Okay, thank you very much. Beth Costello : Amy, in the interest of time I think we can take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Amit, your line is open. Amit Kumar : Thanks and thank you for fitting me in. Just very quickly, going back to Gary's question on Workers' Compensation, what exactly was that 2019 comp loss? Chris Swift : Amit, just as Doug looks at is, no, I'm glad you asked the question because I just wanted to add a perspective that may or may not be helpful to you in that when we established our outlook/guidance for '19, clearly we were fully aware of the environment, particularly pricing, but also loss cost trends composed of frequency and severity in that and when we established the range of our outlook, I thought we were pretty clear and I know I've said and subsequent FT-friendly environments that we did expect some margin compression in Workers' Comp. So as we sit here today, there is nothing that surprised us in the first quarter and as we look at the next three quarters, there is nothing that we see that's going to surprise us or change our original views on guidance. The offset though, we said was that primarily Commercial, Auto, Property and GL we thought we could actually expand margins in this environment and as Doug just said, we're very encouraged and continue to be encouraged with the pricing environment to a lesser extent than the specialty world, but pricing and margins we feel knock wood for the rest of the year can expand and grow, so that in general we would be flattish to maybe slightly down on a year-over-year your margin comparison basis to 18. So that's the context, I think we judge the market very well, are managing appropriately in this environment. But Doug, I don't know if you have that number or if we really want to give it out at this point. Doug Elliot : Well, I guess couple of parts, one is I think our total Workers' Compensation number does make a lot of sense. We are adding excess Workers' Comp from national accounts and with middle and small so, what's relevant to me is that on the quarter we had about a point of Workers' Comp margin pressure point in the quarter and as I commented before, part of that compare is the fact that in the first quarter of 2018 we didn\u2019t have the adjustments that we had made later in the year. So, as the year progresses we're going to watch carefully the gap and Chris that is largely in line with our expectations, so there is nothing that I'm talking about that Beth and I or the teams are surprised about. And what I think about our view of trend and our view of pricing, I think 2019 has started about the way we thought it was. So slight compression, not major and we will watch it every 90 days and share with you what we see in our book. Amit Kumar : Thanks and may be just one very quick followup on Navigators and Navigators have a substantial E&S book in its U.S. operations and I was curious, there has been a lot of discussion right now how it's a tale of two markets where E&S pricing is substantially better than commercial, any thoughts on that Chris or Doug in terms of are you thinking about that piece differently or are you sort of positively surprised by how quickly that piece is turning? Chris Swift : Yes, as I said before we haven\u2019t closed, so it is unfair for us to comment on Navigators trends in the first quarter. We don't know them and obviously you will read about them once they publish their results or when we close first whatever happens. But general market conditions, as Doug said, he and I were at the RIMS Conference in Boston. We'd been to London numerous times and I would say, yes in that E&S wholesale specialty orientation it is a rapidly changing and dynamic environment, one where rates are rising very rapidly in certain lines. So that's the tailwind that we talked about that we feel good about and as we start our ownership of Navigators going forward. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Sabra Purtill for closing remarks. Sabra Purtill : Thank you. We appreciate you all joining us today particularly on such a busy day for earnings. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any followup questions. Thank you and good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Susan Spivak. Ma\u2019am you may begin the conference. Susan Spivak : Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast to discuss second quarter 2019 earnings. We reported our results yesterday afternoon and posted all the earnings-related materials, including the 10-Q on our website. Please note that we reported results a bit later than usual due to the financial reporting integration related to the closing of the Navigators acquisition in May.Before we begin today\u2019s presentation, I want to highlight a couple of upcoming days. First, Beth Costello will be participating in a fireside chat on September 9, at the Barclays Conference in New York City. Second, the tentative date for our third quarter earnings release is November 4. For today\u2019s call, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Doug Elliot, President; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we\u2019ll have a Q&A period.Just a few final comments before Chris begins.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for one year.I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining the call this morning. The Hartford second quarter financial results were strong with excellent Group Benefits margins and solid P&C margins, including lower catastrophe losses than last year. We closed the acquisition of navigators in May, which brings expanded market and growth opportunities in commercials lines. We remained highly confident of the strategic and financial benefits this acquisition will produce.Second quarter core earnings rose 18% over prior year to $485 million or $1.33 per diluted share. Our businesses are performing well. The P&C underlying combined ratio was 92.6 in the quarter and the group benefits core earnings margin was 7.5%. The consolidated 12-month core earnings ROE was at 11.7%, well in excess of our cost of equity and among the best in the industry.During the quarter, we began share repurchases under the $1 billion authorization and expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders in 2019 and 2020 from share repurchases and quarterly dividends helping drive long-term shareholder value creation. Doug and Beth will cover segment results in more detail, but I wanted to touch briefly on a few high-level items.Commercial lines underwriting results, which included navigators for just five weeks remained solid. I'm going to investments and technology, digital in product are driving enhanced capabilities and growth. The cost of these investments put slight pressure on the expense ratio, which is expected to continue for the near-term. Year-to-date, the underlying combined ratio for commercial lines is 92.9, a result in a competitive market.Personal lines results were much better than last year with a lower current accident year loss ratio, including reduced catastrophe losses. Planned marketing and other initiatives continued increasing the expense ratio, but also driving a 49% increase in new business. Group Benefits earnings continue to be simply outstanding with a year-to-date loss ratio of 74.7%, almost 2 points better than last year, along with a slightly lower expense ratio.Persistency and new business levels are solid and include continued growth in voluntary product sales. We recently appointed Jonathan Bennett, a talented and versatile Hartford leader, head of group benefits, following the announced retirement of Mike Concannon.Mike has been with The Hartford for more than two decades with a long list of accomplishments and contributions, and we wish him well. Jonathan and I will be working closely to ensure a smooth transition in a continued track record of success in group benefits. Finally, higher equity capital markets helped Hartford's funds recover from the earnings impact of the fourth quarter decrease in assets under management.Turning to navigators, this quarter results include charges related to the acquisition for : One, the purchase of the previously announced adverse loss development cover; and second, increase in loss reserves from the completion of our review for the 2018 in prior accident years and the 2019 loss picks. With the reserve review completed, we are fully focused on achieving the strategic and financial benefits of this acquisition.Only two-and-a-half months after closing, a significant amount of progress has been made on multiple initiatives, and I am pleased with the continued positive feedback from agents and brokers about the combined potential of our business. We expect a smooth integration and remain confident of the future benefits we will realize from expanded product in underwriting capabilities.In addition, we expect to generate good returns on this investment reaching approximately $200 million in core earnings, excluding the amortization of intangibles within the next 4 years to 5 years. We\u2019re also encouraged by the recent firming in Commercial Lines pricing, particularly in Global Specialty, which is better than anticipated when we first announced the acquisition.Doug will discuss the market in more detail, but I would note that loss trends in certain lines needed increased pricings to achieve acceptable returns and in-part informed our judgments on the acquired reserves, and the 2019 accident year loss picks. The team is focused on capturing the benefit of improving pricing, terms and conditions, particularly in international where results in recent years have been poor.In addition to the trends in Global Specialty, we are also seeing stronger pricing in growth opportunities in middle and large commercial. I am pleased to see that previous investments in expanded industry verticals are generating strong new business growth.To conclude on the quarter and year-to-date, our performance is strong, commercial lines has momentum, and the navigator\u2019s integration is going well. The outlook for commercial lines in the second half of 2019, which includes navigators remains largely consistent with our view provided earlier this year.We expect an underlined combined ratio of 92 to 94. This outlook is essentially flat with last year, including the impact of navigators, which has a slightly higher combined ratio than The Hartford Commercial Lines book. In total, we are well positioned to achieve or exceed the business metric outlook we provided in February and to sustain a strong consolidated ROE.Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to note that we recently published our 2018 sustainability report, which provides the summary of our commitment to environmental stewardship, communities and giving, diversity and inclusion, and ethics and governance. As a company in business for more than 200 years, we understand what it takes to be sustainable and how the company\u2019s actions align with our mission to underwrite human achievement.We are proud of The Hartford\u2019s track record and are committed to achieving the specific goals summarized in our report. You could find that report along with other information on our sustainability programs on our website.Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. This was a strong quarter for our business units and as Chris noted, strategically significant as we closed our acquisition of Navigators. Our Hartford Property and Casualty business units performed very well with strong execution on the top and bottom line, and group benefits posted another quarter of outstanding earnings.Underlying performance in the former Navigators business units, which excludes prior period development and catastrophe losses was in-line with our expectations as we\u2019ve positioned these lines for profitable growth and a rapidly improving specialty marketplace were underwriting is tightening and pricing is firming.In the second quarter, we booked prior accident year reserve adjustments for Navigators in several lines of business and also reset the 2019 accident year loss selections. Beth will be discussing these actions in greater detail. Our integration is off to a strong start. We\u2019ve hit the ground running with teams working together in the market, and across all parts of our enterprise to align strategy, resources, and outcomes.Over the summer months, we\u2019re conducting nearly 400 agent and broker meetings to rollout our combined product capabilities. Talent and expertise were primary drivers of the deal and we\u2019re very excited to have over 800 new teammates join our ranks. The market leadership and underwriting skill these experienced professionals bring to the combined organization is already evident.Efforts began immediately to jointly market our expanded product portfolio as we\u2019re now able to effectively deliver a broader range of coverage solutions to agents, brokers, and customers. I\u2019m very encouraged by several recent wins and the positive reaction of the agents and brokers to writing more lines of business per account with us. Our teamwork is evident to the marketplace and I\u2019m confident we will continue to find more opportunities for growth.I\u2019ll provide more commentary on Navigators performance and current marketplace transit in a moment, but let me begin the review of our business results with Group Benefits, which delivered another outstanding quarter posting core earnings of 115 million with a margin of 7.5%. The increase versus prior year was driven by favorable disability results, higher net investment income and lower amortization of intangibles. This was partially offset by a slightly higher life loss ratio, increased investments in technology and customer experience, and higher commissions.The lower disability loss ratio reflects favorable incident trends across recent accident years. Shifting over to personal lines, we had a solid quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 91. In first lines auto, the underlying combined ratio of 96.7 was two-tenths of a point higher than 2018 with favorable frequency trends and a severity in the low-to-mid single-digit range.Collision severity remains elevated, due to higher repair costs associated with newer vehicles and a larger mix of total losses. Overall, loss cost trends are developing within our expectations. We remain focused on returning to growth in AARP Direct to auto, our lead product for marketing and new customer acquisition. New business in this line grew 44% for the quarter.Direct marketing response rates continue to be strong and our conversion ratio was up versus prior year. Over the last few years, AARP auto retention has improved several percentage points. We remain focused on further increases to retention as a key factor in achieving total written premium growth.Turning over to Commercial Lines, the second quarter underlying combined ratio was 93.2, up 3.2 points versus 2018. The increase was primarily due to elevated inland marine loss experience in Middle Market, higher expenses and the addition of navigator results for five weeks post-closing.For the quarter, renewal written pricing in standard commercial lines was 2.2%, up slightly from first quarter of the year. Pricing excluding worker\u2019s compensation was 5.5%, up several tenths of a point versus first quarter, driven primarily by increases in middle market. Pricing in auto was nearly double digits, and we saw solid increases in property and general liability.Margins in worker\u2019s compensation were strong across our business units and consistent with our expectations. Results to date indicate they were managing market forces effectively and I remain pleased with our worker\u2019s compensation pricing and underwriting strategy as we seek to balance margins and growth.Let me touch on a few additional details for our commercial businesses. Small commercial had another excellent quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.8. Written premium grew 6%, with a 183 million of new business and excellent retention in the high-80s. New business was led by the foremost renewal rights deal.In addition, we also experienced excellent growth from our core book, with new business up 10% versus prior year. New business flow from the foremost deal is essentially complete at this point. This is a great opportunity for us to scale our market leading platform and to extend our partnership with many of our existing agents. We also developed a number of new agency relationships that have been growing steadily over the last year. Our team executed flawlessly on this transaction and we\u2019re well prepared for similar opportunities in the future.In Middle & Large Commercial, the underlying combined ratio was 100.9, increasing 3.8 points versus last year. We experienced another quarter with a number of large losses in the Hartford inland marine book, specifically builder\u2019s risk. Approximately 3 points of this increase is attributable to large water intrusion claims that occurred near project completion. Several of these losses resulted from less experienced workers on the job in this tight labor market. We\u2019ve taken actions to address this part of our business and expect performance to improve.The expense ratio was also slightly higher driven primarily commissions. Written premium in Middle & Large Commercial increased 15%. Retentions were solid and new business production was outstanding at $177 million for middle market, up 31% versus prior year. New business growth continues to be fueled by our industry practice groups in areas such as construction, programs, and energy. We\u2019re also seeing strong growth in our other core industries, including manufacturing, technology, and professional services.Our strategy of underwriting specialization is helping to drive this growth and increase our focus on pricing and margin improvement. In Global Specialty, comprised of U.S. international and reinsurance business units, the underlying combined ratio was 90.7. Given the navigator results are only included for five weeks of the second quarter, I\u2019ll focus my commentary on current business performance and marketplace trends.Overall the specialty markets are in positive transition. Industry financial results support the need for pricing and underwriting actions as prior years have been developing unfavorably in several lines. Our Global Specialty team has experienced progressively firming market conditions each month during the quarter. Real pricing for Navigators business block was in the high-single digits for the quarter, up more than 5 points from the first quarter and also from prior year.Lines of business with particularly strong pricing include marine cargo, excess casualty, D&O and property. This is an important time for our teams to be focused on business fundamentals and now that the deal is closed, our number one priority is improving margin performance.Let me now turn to the individual business units of Global Specialty. In the U.S., we recorded prior year development largely in the ocean marine, primary casualty and D&O books, with only a modest adjustment to the current year loss ratios and casualty. Underlying performance year-to-date has been solid with strong returns in management and professional liability lines and bond.Given the market momentum I just described, our trends is for \u2013 our outlook is for favorable renewed pricing trends, exceeding expected loss trends. The international business, primarily comprised of Lloyds syndicate and London market portfolio has been under financial stress due to its historical growth focus.We\u2019ve increased our prior and current action year loss ratio picks in financial and casualty lines and are fundamentally repositioning portions of this book through underwriting and nonrenewable actions. The rapidly firming market will provide a tailwind as we execute our business plans for needed margin improvement.In Global Reinsurance, our business is mainly comprised of accident health, property, global credit, Latin American surety, and other casualty lines. During 2019, underwriting results have been challenged in the accident and health resulting in prior year reserve development and an increase to the current year loss ratio. This is largely a medical stoploss business, and we're aggressively tightening our underwriting and increasing pricing, while non-renewing accounts that do not meet our financial thresholds.As we look ahead with Global Specialty, I\u2019m more convinced than ever that our expanded talent and product capabilities are powerful addition to our Commercial Lines platform. Vince Tizzio, our Global Specialty leader along with a very experienced team comprised of both Navigators and Hartford teammates are driving business plans with great acumen and energy.As we work together every day, and now with the full engagement of our agents and brokers, I see our strategy unfolding in the market, positioning us for further success as a Commercial Lines leader.Based on our year-to-date results, our outlook for Commercial Lines in the second half of 2019 is for a combined ratio between 95 and 97 with an underlying combined ratio between 92 and 94. Total commercial lines earned premium for the six months is expected to be approximately 4.4 billion.In closing, this quarter represents an exciting milestone in our journey. Our integration with Navigators is in full swing. We\u2019re operating as a combined organization bringing broad capabilities and deep underwriting expertise to the market and we continue to see new opportunities to leverage these skills in all parts of our commercial lines business. This important step forward along with the strength of our group benefits and Personal Line businesses positions the Hartford for continued success. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Doug. Today, I'm going to cover second quarter results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and Corporate, including capital management activities, as well as the impact of the Navigators acquisition. The investment portfolio continues to perform very well with no impairments, strong LP returns, and generally stable investment yields. Net investments income was 488 million for the quarter, up 60 million or 14% from the prior year quarter. Excluding Navigators, net investment income was 476 million or 11% higher than the prior year quarter.Limited partnership returns were strong in all asset classes with an annualized return of 14% for both the quarter and year-to-date. This compares to an annualized yield of 9.5% in the second quarter 2018. The annualized portfolio yield was 4.2% before tax and 3.4% after-tax, slightly above second quarter 2018. Excluding LP, the second quarter 2019 annualized portfolio yield was 3.1% after-tax, flat with second quarter 2018.Lower market interest rates and tighter credit spreads increased net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax to a total of 1.4 billion at June 30 from about 700 million at March 31 and almost no net unrealized gain at year-end 2018. As a reminder, unrealized gains on equity securities are classified and realized capital gains in the income statement and are not included in AOCI. Total realized and unrealized gains on equity securities were 30 million before tax in the quarter and 162 million before tax year-to-date.Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings of 38 million were flat with last year and up 10 million sequentially. Daily average AUM rose 5% from first quarter 2019, reflecting strong market performance, partially offset by modest net outflows and was up about 1% over second quarter 2018. Investment performance remains very strong.As of June 30, 2019, about 70% of Hartford Funds outperformed peers on a one, three, and five-year basis. Corporate core losses of 35 million were 54% lower than second quarter 2018, principally due to higher investment income and lower interest expense, due to net debt reduction over the last year. As a reminder, the three main drivers of corporate results are investment income on cash and short-term investments, interest expense and preferred dividends, and net income from our investment in Talcott.Taking into consideration the reduction in average cash and short-term investments, due to the 2.1 billion purchase price for Navigators, as well as interest expense and timing of preferred dividends, I would expect the quarterly run rate in corporate to be a loss of 55 million to 65 million after-tax before consideration of net income from the Talcott investment. The impact of our proportionate share of Talcott's net income is harder to predict and was 22 million after-tax in the first-quarter and 2 million after-tax this quarter.During the quarter, we began share repurchases under the $1 billion authorization. Since its inception and through the end of July, we have repurchased about 800,000 shares for $43 million. As previously discussed, we expect to use this program with discretion, based on current and projected holding company cash position and liquidity needs, and expect to utilize the majority of the program in 2020.In total, second quarter core earnings of 485 million and core earnings per diluted share of $1.33 were both up 18% over second quarter 2018. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share was $41.55, up 5% year-to-date and 9% since June 30, 2018. Core earnings ROE over the last 12 months, which includes fourth quarter 2018\u2019s wildfire catastrophe losses was 11.7%. Our year-to-date annualized core earnings ROE is 13.4%.The closing of The Navigators acquisition on May 23 impacted our results in several areas. I will briefly review these and additional details are included on Pages 6 and 7 of the slides. Core earnings had a modest net contribution from Navigators as their closing occurred more than halfway through the quarter. Net income included several acquisition-related charges.First, in the quarter, we recorded transaction and integration-related costs of 31 million before tax of which 21 million was related to Navigators. We expect to incur additional charges through 2021 for a total of 90 million to 100 million before tax of which 15 million relates to integration activity. Second, upon closing, we entered into the previously announced adverse development cover and reported a charge of 72 million after-tax. Finally, we made two adjustments to Navigators reserves after closing.We increased the pre-acquisition 2019 accident year reserve by 29 million before tax. We also increased our estimate of prior year loss reserve by 159 million of which 91 million was ceded to the ADC, resulting in a net charge net charge of 68 million before tax. After these actions, there remains 209 million of coverage under the ADC for development for 2018 and prior accident year reserves.Overall, the reserve actions we have taken incorporate our methodologies and judgement. Going forward, Navigators reserves will be part of our normal quarterly reserve review process.To summarize, second quarter results were very strong. We are hard at work on the integration of Navigators and focused on maximizing the potential of all of our businesses with our combined teams and enhanced product and underwriting capabilities. With strong capital generation and financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress.I'll now turn the call over to Susan, so we can begin the Q&A session. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Carmen, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question. Operator : And you first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Hello, can you hear me? Operator : Yes. We can hear you. Brian Meredith : Okay, great. So, first question for you all. Chris, just curious, could you kind of walk through from The Navigators perspective, now that you\u2019ve got it integrated \u2013 or integrated \u2013 on your books, how does your kind of accretion forecast look \u2013 low end, high end, kind of what are your expectations for it? Chris Swift : Sure. Thanks for joining us Brian. As we said, both Doug and I invest in our prepared comments. I mean, we\u2019re confident about both the financial and strategic aspects here. I think on the longer-term basis, we\u2019ll still see the ability to generate 200 million of core earnings ex-amortization of intangibles over the next 4 to 5 years. I think there is support levers that remain the same that we\u2019ve talked about. What\u2019s going to contribute to that? One would be expenses, two would be NII, three would be \u2013 and you heard from Doug that actions that were beginning to take on the in-force management to improve the margins on the existing book, and then fourth, a contributor but not a large one, you know the cross-sell revenue.So, I would say those are the components. The waiting might be a little different Brian then we first thought 6 months to 9 months ago, particularly with lower interest rates, but I would say that we didn\u2019t expect this level of pricing firming as rapidly as it has been. So, we\u2019ve taken the adjustments, so we think we needed to particularly on the 19, accident year loss picks, which is generally in-line with our pricing models and our deal models, maybe slightly little higher, but equally I think there is more rate environment, more rate to capture.So, we see all those pieces fitting together to generate that $200 million of core earnings and you remain really, really confident and pleased with how the teams have been interacting and behaving particularly in the marketplace. Brian Meredith : Excellent. And then another question, just curious, could you talk a little bit about your thoughts and exposure to the reviver statutes and kind of what we're seeing with what\u2019s going on all these states? Chris Swift : Sure. I guess there is one other point I would just mention as it relates to the integration activities. I mean, we did guide on our prior call to 110 million to 145 million of core earnings in 2020 Brian. I would say that\u2019s still a valid range, but I would anchor a little bit more on the lower-end, particularly given the interest rate environments, we thought we were going to get a little quicker left with interest rates, even after marking the balance sheet to market.So, we still see [110-ish million] in 2020 as far as an accretion potential. As it relates to reviver statutes and activities, I would say, first, we\u2019ve got a long history of managing and dealing with I\u2019ll call it complex claims in area, particularly bodily injury, mass tort \u2013 and Jan Kinney, who heads our team and his lawyers and claims professionals, I think do an outstanding job. Whether it\u2019s on a primary basis or excess basis, remember we have a lot of excess claims experienced, particularly coming through our first interstate state operations in Boston.So, I would then say on a social side, I understand the desire to make people, allow people to talk about their injuries and present claims, but on the other, and it\u2019s a slippery slope to sort of open up years of case law and litigation and how contracts are resolved, but I know that\u2019s occurring, but I would also say that for us you would primarily focus in on three major areas. The liability associated with injuries, particularly in commercial auto, obviously the sexual abuse and reviver claims, and then head injury.I'm not going into specifics on any particular aspect other than we\u2019re well aware, we\u2019ve been on top of these trends for a long, long time and as I\u2019ve always said Brian, we\u2019re in the business of paying claims, and we want to pay claims that are legitimate and where people are injured, but equally in some of these areas we're going to be sensitive and that\u2019s a plight word of saying, if there was a contributory actions or inactions that have consequences on our terms and conditions and our policies, we\u2019ll be equally vigilant in asserting our rights because the rest of our policyholders would expect that.And that\u2019s where the social inflation comes into effect that everyone is talking about. It affects everyone and we\u2019ll be thoughtful, we want to be fair, but also make sure that people are living up to the terms and conditions in our contract. So, that\u2019s what I would say at this point-in-time. Brian Meredith : Okay. It makes it, but if you re-evaluated your reserve positions given what\u2019s been going on? Chris Swift : As I tried to say, I mean, we\u2019ve been managing these types of activities for a long, long time. I would say that we have case reserves and IBNR established for known losses and obviously incurred, but not reported losses. We\u2019re going to have to really see sort of the volume of the new activities that really comment. So, as we sit here today, we feel really good about the balance sheet, but not knowing what\u2019s going to come out as in the future from new claims, new activities, new theories, you can never be absolute, but just know we do have provisions that we feel comfortable at right now. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Susan Spivak : Yes, we can hear you. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. My first question on the disclosure within commercial lines on the standard commercial earned premium rate, so that was 2.2% in the quarter, it trended down sequentially and then when you look back last year, I know you guys are getting more written price right now, but I'm just trying to think about the earned premium that you're seeing and expectations for a rate that you are earning to the balance of this year, and also into 2020, as I think about the underlying margin profile for small commercial and mid-to-large account segments, and just thinking of the rate versus trend and kind of the underlying margin expansion you might see or contraction there? Doug Elliot : Elyse good morning. It\u2019s Doug. I would suggest that the earned trend is going to follow some of this momentum on the revenue side. So, obviously it\u2019s a calculation and as we see slightly upward signals in those pricing indicators, the earned premium will follow at that, number one. Number two, we gave you a comp, ex-comp split, right?So, you know that we\u2019ve got a little bit of negative pressure on pricing, particularly in small commercial that will pay out and the mechanics of that are lost trend at the moment might be slightly ahead of, where the small commercial pricing is, but in middle we\u2019ve done a nice job of achieving flat to just slightly down pricing in comp and so very pleased with what we're seeing in metal.In the non-comp lines, you know, we\u2019re feeling better than we were 90 days ago about signals in the marketplace, and our ability to get a little bit of rate. I know that the changes are not up materially, but they matter to us in several key lines. They\u2019re moving in the right direction. So, we\u2019re on the rate push hard, we\u2019re working harder account by account and I\u2019m encouraged by what I see as we close up the second quarter. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. And my second question, on the Navigators book, so you guys took a true-up on prior year and then also on the current year, so on the current year adjusted, I\u2019m assuming the adjustments were really saturated kind of in the same lines where you took the prior year development and then, can you also just give us a sense of where the underlying margin you\u2019re starting with for that business given that you now trued it up versus your expectations when you announced the deal? Beth Costello : Sure. I\u2019ll start with that and Doug please feel free to add in. So, the lines that we adjusted for the current year, you know, some were consistent, again in the U.S. wholesale casualty area and a little bit in the D&O and E&O of book and as Doug mentioned, kind of in the international casualty area, and when we looked at the \u2013 our projections back at the time of the acquisition, we had anticipated needing to increase those accident year picks a bit. I would say, the final adjustments that we made were probably a point or point-and-half higher than that, but relatively speaking, we\u2019re in-line with what we were thinking.So, a lot of the things that Doug talked about as it relates to the book and actions that we\u2019re taking and pricing will obviously help improve those margins going forward. And our views on their underlying margins were included in the overall guidance that we gave for the second half of 2019, and again their book we would expect to run at our higher combined ratio then our historical Hartford book. Doug Elliot : The only thing I would ask Beth is that, some of that Navigator combined ratio dynamic is playing into the fact that our new outlook is just slightly up a point or so on the underlying. So, the mixing end of that Navigators book and actually your encounter \u2013 your 2019 is causing a little bit of that bump. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. Obviously, there\u2019s a reserve strengthening on the, I guess, I don't know, is it the 1Q Navigators or is the first five months just as a better understanding? Beth Costello : So, Josh are you talking about the current accident year? Josh Shanker : Yes. 2019. Beth Costello : Yes. So, it would be for the first five months. Josh Shanker : First five months. Okay. Beth Costello : Yes. Through the date of acquisition. Josh Shanker : This then implies an increase to The Navigators combined ratio about 500 basis points in addition to what\u2019s going on in the rate market right now. When you think about modelling or the next year, how much attritional policy and premium decline do you expect as you put through the necessary rates to get to a Hartford level of conservatism in the book? Doug Elliot : Josh, this is Doug. I would say, it\u2019s a little premature for us to take you all the way down through that path. We are building those plans. We had original plans, obviously, we\u2019ve been updating over the course of the last two quarters, but there are so many moving pieces and as you know, as Chris commented on, several of their core lines are going through an aggressive degree of firming at the moment. So, we are making decisions and plans around what we see in the current marketplace, around retentions, required retentions, pricing and also new business levels that we think are appropriate for not only the combined ratio as it sits here today, but also what we think the opportunity is in that book moving ahead. So, we\u2019ll provide more of that as we go forward in the next several quarters. Josh Shanker : Okay. And I guess it\u2019s another easy one. Was there any prior year reserve development on The Navigators loss reserves not applicable to the NICO cover, and how should we consider the risks associated with that non-NICO covered part of the portfolio? Beth Costello : Good question. So, as it relates to the actions that we took in the second quarter for prior years, all of it was applicable to the cover. I\u2019ll remind you that it was probably about $100 million of reserves that we excluded from the cover versus primarily covering things like unallocated loss adjustment expenses. We are obviously taking the exposure on reinsurance collectability and then a handful of specific claims that were not covered. So, as it related to the actions we took, we saw no need to make any increases to those of reserves that were not covered by the reinsurance agreement. Chris Swift : Josh, it\u2019s Chris. Welcome. Thanks for joining the call after your Rolling Stones concert last night. Second, I would just add a little color again. The allocated \u2013 on allocated loss adjustment expense in the reinsurance, it\u2019s similar to other transactions we\u2019ve done with Nico and the handful of claims that I\u2019ve described, I would say relates to pollution exposures that we judged favorably. So, I don't think there is going to be any big surprises that are going to materially change any view on reserve positions and/or the reinsurance transaction in total. Josh Shanker : Okay, thank you. I appreciate the answers, I\u2019ll re-queue, maybe will get lucky. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Mike Zaremski : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. First question, thanks for the color on the expense ratio increase, curious about, I believe you said some of it is due to upwards pressure and brokerage commissions. I think you also mentioned that on last quarter\u2019s call, maybe you can help us understand as like how big of a component that is and what\u2019s kind of driving that? Is that being driven by some of the private equity backed brokers or is it all of them kind of doing the same thing? Doug Elliot : Mike, this is Doug. It\u2019s more run rate commission. And so, when I think about quarter-to-quarter point, one point, two points have changed in the expense area, but half of that is coming from commission, much of that is coming from small commercial where we either have special deals happening. We\u2019ve got terrific profitability indicators. So, our contingencies around loss are up a little bit year-to-year and I would just characterize what we see in small as normal, competitive commission adjustments.What we see in the middle, more related to reinsurance, I don\u2019t even think of that in the case of normal brokerage, it\u2019s just we have some seated commissions and reinsurance a little bit different than they were last year. So, that\u2019s why I described the commission piece as really normal operating circumstances. Mike Zaremski : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And lastly, switching to group benefits, clearly excellent results continue, doesn\u2019t look like you guys changed your guidance there, maybe you can kind of update us on the competitive environments in group? Chris Swift : Mike, let me just speak to guidance and Doug can give you some of his color on the competitive environment. The six to seven guidance on margin, we still believe is a long-term guidance that is reflective of long-term condition. Obviously, in the near term here, we\u2019ve been outperforming, which we would honestly expect to continue at least through the second half of 2019. So, we\u2019re not changing, not updating, but we\u2019re acknowledged that we\u2019re performing better primarily from incidences, but I would remind you that it is still a competitive environment Doug and the top ten group benefit players control large portion of the market, but competition is still fierce as ever and we\u2019re remaining disciplined. I don\u2019t know, if you would add any color Doug? Doug Elliot : No, I agree with that. I think we\u2019re competing well in this space. The numbers are pretty good shape across the industry. Our numbers are obviously outstanding. Second quarter is not as larger quarter as the first quarter, but our sales were up a bit in the first quarter. We feel good about that, continue to grow our Specialty products, our voluntary products, so you see that in our supplement. Just we\u2019re encouraged. And Chris, our disability trends are in good shape, so a strong quarter for our group business. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Just one question. You did mention many changes to reinsurance related to The Navigators acquisition, I was wondering if that might change significantly over time given the Navigators was a pretty heavy user of reinsurance over time? Doug Elliot : Paul in the short-term, I would suggest that reinsurance programs are largely going to stay in place. Our teams are working diligently on a combined basis evaluating what programs need to come together over time, what programs will be left stand on it, etc. So, as I think about the rest of 2019 and the early part 2020, largely think of their programs intact and then we\u2019ll adjust over time and share some of that information as it comes. Paul Newsome : As you now re-examined the book, are there any pieces of Navigators that you want to shrink or readdress significantly? Chris Swift : Paul, again we just closed, what, 75 days ago, really excited, we\u2019ve been focused on, obviously our go to market activities in the U.S. and in London taking the corrective actions that Doug has talked about. We like all the pieces that we see, but we just are going to, let\u2019s continue to learn, that\u2019s why we're keeping the reinsurance programs the same and to learn from The Navigator\u2019s team and adjust accordingly, and I would say the same thing with any major pieces of the business. It all fits together. It works, we like it, but we\u2019ve only owned it for 75 days. Paul Newsome : Thanks. And best of luck for the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. Good morning everybody. My first question, I guess this is a multi-part question now, with regards to the large property losses that you're seeing in commercial, so one, are those related to the large losses you saw in the first quarter that were part of the same trend? Two, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on the actions you\u2019ve taken? And three when do you expect these actions to actually result in lower margins? Doug Elliot : Thank you, Yaron. This is Doug. So, a few comments about our rain book. We did see some adverse experience in the first quarter, which I did comment on first quarter call, a bit more in the second quarter. Again, second quarter leaned a little bit heavier into builders\u2019 risk, you know it\u2019s a policy we offer associated with construction sites were essentially we replace the damaged property on the site. I think there\u2019s quite a bit of volatility in the second quarter. We have pulled the covers back across all those losses. I mentioned water intrusion in my commentary, seen a number of pipes couplings, connections, damaged material values in some of our construction sites.So, we\u2019re on it. We changed the leadership in the underwriting profile that business about 15 months ago. That process is well underway. These projects run several years. We know exactly where inventory is today. Yes, I don't think this is over at the end of June, but I do think this is well managed, well contained, both claim engineering, and also our underwriting teams are working together.And this little volatility and a pretty small line first in the middle. We\u2019ll have little volatility, but it isn\u2019t something right now that\u2019s keeping me up. I think, the line is not just putting pressure here at the Hartford. I think there are others in the business that are feeling that pressure, but as I think about the rest of 2019 and 2020, we\u2019ll get this issue behind us. I don't think it\u2019s a huge deal and we\u2019ll share a little bit about that journey as we go forward. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question relates to the personal auto book. I think you\u2019re seeing that you\u2019re seeing severity in the low to mid-single digits, which just seems a little lower than what we\u2019ve been hearing or seeing among other carriers. Can we maybe talk about what would drive severity to be a bit lower at The Hartford book? Is it a different mix of cars, is it different policy type, different negotiated arrangements with auto shops or what\u2019s driving that? Doug Elliot : I think it\u2019s really hard for me to compare ourselves to others. There\u2019s so many different nuances of various books. When I talked about severity, I am combining all elements of severity, right. Our collision is up a little bit, our liability, severity is in very good shape, and obviously our frequency numbers are in a very strong shape for the first six months of the year. So, I don't know how to contrast our book with others, you know it is heavily ERP dominated that plus 50 crowd, that matters relative to drive miles, driven, parts of the year et cetera, but I don't think there\u2019s something that sticks out to me right now that\u2019s saying, our severity is causing something that others might not be seeing. Yaron Kinar : Doug, you were cut out. I think, I only heard the last sentence of your response. Doug Elliot : I don't think there is one reason. Can you hear me Yaron? Yaron Kinar : Yes. Doug Elliot : I don't think there is any one reason that suggest our book will perform differently than others. We manage aggressively, all of the comp liability and physical damage collision matters for our customers and I think we do a very adequate job. We work with terrific partner on the outside and have dedicated confident team inside. So, I think, we're thoughtful about our work claim process, and I don't have a reason to suggest our numbers or understand why they\u2019re different than others. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Randy Binnner with B. Riley FBR. Randy Binnner : Hi, good morning, thanks. I actually had \u2013 I think a couple related to commercial auto. The first is a question on the in-land marine losses that are disclosed as being elevated, could you describe what those are and I\u2019m just curious if they are related to wheels-based loss or something else? Doug Elliot : The builders risk essentially would be equipment materials on the job side. So, I don't think auto there. I think water intrusion causing damage to all kinds of equipment in sheetrock on the walls et cetera. There were earlier in the year a couple of marine losses in transit. When you think in-transit marine that would have involved vehicles, so yes, it was a little commercial auto pressure there, but primarily second quarter, I\u2019m talking about intrusion of water in a four-wall structure. Randy Binnner : Okay, got you. And then, just on the commercial auto, overall, it has not been a topic that\u2019s come up on this call, but it is still a major issue for the group, and so, I\u2019m curious kind of where you think pricing versus loss cost is there and kind of where The Hartford sits in the process of the industry getting on top of those liabilities? Doug Elliot : I guess, I\u2019d start by suggesting the make-up of our book is largely small commercial where the middle market fleet as well, and now Navigators brings especially auto component to us. In terms of our core book, we\u2019ve been managing aggressively auto for six, seven years now. Our exposures are down materially over the last five years, you know plus 30% [indiscernible] change in auto. Still not satisfied with our great adequacies today, our combined ratios are still not acceptable across both small and middle, and so there\u2019s still more work to be done.Given where we see pricing today, yes, I think that pricing from our view and our middle and small books is on top of the loss trend, which means we\u2019re now delivering better margins, but we're very careful \u2013 with a very careful eye watching 2016, 2017, 2018, some of those years that are closing up and this line has our full attention and will over the next several quarters for sure. Randy Binnner : Is it a growth opportunity then, if you have your pricing right relative to loss trend are you seeing a lot more opportunity to rate business? Doug Elliot : Well there is a lot of business in the marketplace. It is on the top of our growth priority. We\u2019re certainly not a major mono line provider and I'm talking about historical Hartford at the moment. We certainly look at it when we're rounding of accounts and we want to protect our accounts. So, no it\u2019s not on the top of our queue list to be facing mono line auto.With our specialty auto deviation now with Navigators, I think a good opportunity they\u2019ve got terrific instincts, they\u2019ve got great data and they\u2019ll be thoughtful about their opportunities, but I would ask you to think about the different pieces of our book, and all told, we\u2019re not an enormous auto player relative to the industry in general. Chris Swift : I think that\u2019s the big distinction Doug, right. We're not big fleet players. I mean, we tend to ensure trucks, vehicles on the small-to-medium size business. We\u2019re not national programs. It\u2019s not, just given the environment, Randy it\u2019s not a growth area as Doug said. Randy Binnner : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Hi, thanks, good morning. This might have already been pretty clearly confirmed, but just I guess for my own head, so the new 92 to 94 guide wouldn't be any different if it weren\u2019t just the addition of The Navigators mix, and you feel just as good about Navigators as you get at the time of the deal, is that right? Doug Elliot : That\u2019s right. With the exception, we have built in a little bit of this pressure on builder risk, both what we experienced first half has set our view. So, we\u2019ve treated our loss ratios in the marine area in the second half of the year. Largely, all the other lines remain on track. Beth Costello : Yes. And I will just add to that Ryan, just to be clear. So, absent navigators, we probably would be a point down relative to what our original thought was for, first for second half of the year. Ryan Tunis : Understood. Beth Costello : So, obviously, Navigators coming in at a higher loss ratio, combined ratio is kind of in the mix, but we put it altogether. We feel very good about being able to be in that range. Ryan Tunis : Got you. Doug Elliot : Ryan, I would remind you, you know the compare on that, you have to almost go back to 2018 and think about what happened in Q\u2019s 3 and 4. We were doing some adjusting to the workers comp line still in Q3 of last year. I think that\u2019s something that just has to factor in here. Ryan Tunis : Got you. And I think I wanted to go back to Elyse\u2019s question, Beth did a good job talking about the accident year actions, and how would those compare to the original expectations at the time of the deal, but I\u2019m still having a little bit of a hard time with, I think there\u2019s like a $150 million of growth charges that Hartford took and there have also been some charges that Navigators had taken in the quarter since the deal. The acquisition was announced. So, yes, I mean on the reserving side, we just said all the activity that we have seen has also been around the level that you would have expected the time you announced the deal or could you just highlight some areas where things ended up being a little bit more elevated? Beth Costello : Yes, so, if you go all the way back to the time, we announced the deal, I would say that the \u2013 our views relative to reserve increases have increased from there. We obviously took that into consideration when we started to look at purchasing an adverse development cover. I would say that the actions that we took are relatively consistent with what we would have thought at the time that we entered int to the ADC, so we sort of incorporated those views when we look to purchase protection.And as I said in my remarks feel very good about the fact that there remained $209 million under that cover, and I would say the areas that we\u2019re seeing the increases are relatively consistent, and just, again some of the size of those increases has changed, and we incorporated all of that as we thought about our 2019 accident picks, both what we felt needed to be adjusted from what Navigators had recorded pre-acquisition, as well as incorporating those views into our updated guidance for the second half of this year. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Susan Spivak : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please. Operator : Yes ma\u2019am. Your final question will come from the line of Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Mike Phillips : Hi, great. Thanks for [indiscernible]. Appreciate it. I guess, Doug made some comments on the reserve issues in some of the smaller lines for Personal liability and the [indiscernible] liability, I guess, I was looking to see maybe a little more detail in kind of what exactly you are seeing there, you know how confident you are, that you got things fixed and maybe some pressures going forward in those specific lines in Professional liability? Doug Elliot : Mike, I would say that, if you go back and think about some of the pressure spots and Navigators towards the end of last year and early this year, obviously there has been some pressure in the international book. Some of that marine book internationally and also the D&O book, and they were addressing some of their own and essentially as we looked at the tail factors and we looked at those cases, we just decided that we needed to makes some adjustments.So, that\u2019s how I think about several of those lines. In the U.S., our view of tail and torque came together with their actuaries and we spent a lot of time debating and looking at things. So, I don\u2019t look at what we did over the last quarter. These changes as anything very, very different than our discussions last summer, but they were updated back based on facts and debates as we came together and close to second quarter. Mike Phillips : Okay, thanks. I guess one more on Personal [indiscernible] turned back to that. You commented that the premium drop in Personal Lines was kind of part of it was your non-renewal business and I guess maybe when do you expect kind of an inflection on that piece of the personal lines? Doug Elliot : Well, our goal is to be turning into growth as we close out 2019 and move into 2020. We\u2019re encouraged because as you can see, our new business numbers look much more positive than they were this point last year. Again, we\u2019re working on retention. The rate change, you know the book has had a pretty solid profit perspective. So, I think the rate change probably won\u2019t move a lot over the next 6 to 9 months. But we think the new business will grow and if we get a lift in retentions, we\u2019ll see those positive numbers move approaching end of year 2019. Mike Phillips : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And that does conclude our question and answer portion of today\u2019s call. I will now turn the call back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you, operator. In conclusion, we just appreciate all of you joining us this morning and we apologize for the technical difficulties and the sound interference during Beth\u2019s note. Please note that there will be a transcript available and we\u2019re happy to talk after this call to clarify anything that wasn\u2019t clear during our prepared remarks. Thank you, and look forward to next quarter. Operator : Thank you again for joining today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford\u2019s website for one year.I will now turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Hartford had an excellent quarter with strong financial results across all our business lines. Third quarter earnings rose 31% over prior year to 548 million or $1.50 per diluted share with lower catastrophe losses and continues to solid investment results.Our businesses are performing very well. Book value per diluted share excluding a AOCI was up 8% to $42.55 from year-end. The consolidated 12 months core earnings ROE was 12.3% in impressive results in the current market environment.The strong execution of our strategy is demonstrated by our consistent operating performance quarter-to-quarter delivering on key integration milestones and continuing to invest in our business to enhance customer experience in efficiency.Dough and Beth will cover results in more detail, but I wanted to touch briefly on a few items. Commercial lines highlights in the third quarter include core earnings of 303 million up 14% over prior year. Solid top-line growth with and without Navigators and renewal pricing rate acceleration compared to the first half of the year.When we announced the acquisition of Navigators more than a year ago, an important part of our strategy was to broaden our underwriting in product capabilities as a global specialty player and added benefit was the expansion of our distribution relationships into the wholesale channel to serve more risk needs of customers.Nearly six months have passed since we have closed the Navigators transaction. The progress to-date is on-track and I'm very pleased with collaboration amongst the teams and the positive reception from distribution partners.Our book is benefiting from the strong pricing tailwinds in the market, providing the opportunity to restore certain product lines within global specialty to targeted financial returns. Personal lines core earnings were 87 million up 85% benefiting from lower catastrophe losses in favorable prior year development.While up slightly from prior year the underlying combined ratio of 92.3 for personal lines was a strong result. Our primary focus in this business has been returning to growth with new business up 34% in the quarter.Overall net favorable reserve development for property and casualty was 47 million in the quarter, there were both favorable and unfavorable development in various lines. Our experienced actuarial and claims teams have demonstrated the ability to identify emerging trends within our data, which is used to update our estimates each quarter. Overall, I\u2019m confident in our last reserve estimates.Group benefits delivered another excellent quarter with core earnings of 141 million up 38% the increase versus per year was driven by favorable loss ratio, higher net investment income and lower amortization of intangibles. This was partially offset by increased investments in technology, claims management and higher commissions related to our voluntary products.Our total loss ratio improved 4.4 points, driven by favorable disability results partially offset by a deterioration in the life loss ratio. The improvement in the disability continues to come from favorable incidence trends.Results also benefited from updates to our claim recovery assumptions and the recognition of an experience refund related to New York paid family leave product or accident year 2018. In group life severity was elevated in the quarter however, we don\u2019t see any consistent trend other than normal volatility.On the top-line, fully insured ongoing premiums were just off slightly versus prior year. Persistency is running slightly below historical trends as we adjust pricing on targeted segments of the Aetna book.Importantly earned premium on the Aetna book of business is in-line with our deal assumptions and conversions of cases continues to go very well from both the platform and pricing perspective. Overall, we are very pleased with the operational execution and financial performance of group benefits.Before I turn the call over to Doug, wanted to make a few comments on the microenvironment. The property and casualty industry is facing a number of challenges that have been well documented. Net investment income is under pressure in what is likely a prolonged period of low interest rates effecting new money in overall portfolio yields.The frequency of severe weather related storms as well as other catastrophic events such as wild fires are elevated, pressuring rates to keep up with CAT trends. Social inflation related to larger claim settlement continues to put pressure on loss cost trends.However, social inflation is not a new phenomena, we have been monitoring these trends for years taking the appropriate actions to ensure our pricing models in underwriting reflect these realities. To conclude with one quarter left in the year, our experience through the first nine-months is generally consistent with the outlook we provided with no major surprises.The successful integration and execution of our two recent transactions, strong financial results and capital management demonstrate our strategy is working. It is an exciting time at the Hartford for all our stakeholders, customers, employees, distribution partners and shareholders. I\u2019m confident in our ability to produce consistent results contributing to shareholder value creation.Now, I will turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. The Hartford\u2019s property and casual results for the quarter were strong. Top-line growth was fueled by the Navigators acquisitions, while underlying organic growth and commercial lines was a solid 4%.In personnel lines, new business growth is up significantly from third quarter 201,8 but is moderated from earlier in the year. We are pleased with the underlying returns across all of our Property and Casualty businesses as each continues to execute effectively.With a relatively benign quarter for catastrophes, as losses were below third quarter 2018. Current year CAT losses in the quarter total $106 million, $63 million less than a year ago.In aggregate Property and Casualty reported favorable prior year development of $47 million this quarter improving severity trends across workers compensation, small commercial package business and personnel line auto all drove favorable reserve releases.Partially offsetting these releases was a reserve strengthening and commercial auto liability and general liability driven by some large loss activity.As Chris has already mentioned, there has been a fair amount of commentary during the quarter regarding social inflation and we are certainly not immune to these unfavorable tort trends. However, keep in mind our Hartford book is made up primarily of smaller customers with lower limit profiles.In addition, the adverse development cover we purchased on the Navigators wants development provides another layer of protection. Over the past few years, while we have observed higher loss trends, we have also adjusted general liability and commercial auto reserves accordingly. At the same time, we have made underwriting and pricing adjustments to our book in response to these trends. We actively monitor these trends and will continue to take appropriate actions as necessary.Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. The underlying combined for commercial lines which excludes catastrophes and prior development was 93.9 deteriorating two tenths of a point from last year but a strong performance nonetheless.As expected the Navigators\u2019 book generated approximately one point of increase on the combined ratio. This was partially offset by favorable non-CAT property results. I'm encouraged by the pricing environment in the quarter.Our renewal written pricing and standard commercial lines was 2.8% up 40 basis points sequentially from second quarter and up 90 basis points from prior year. This positive pricing change remains somewhat depressed by the current workers compensation pricing environment.Middle market pricing excluding workers compensation was 5.6% in the quarter up 130 basis points from second quarter and up 180 basis points from the prior year. The strong improvement reflects the rate actions we are taking across our core lines. Given industry loss trends and operating performance in these non-workers compensation lines, I expect this pricing trend to persist.Let's now take a look inside our commercial line business units. Small commercial continued it is excellent performance with an underlying combined ratio at 87.9. The margin improvement versus last year was driven primarily by lower non-GAAP property losses and lower underwriting expenses.Written premium was flat to prior year due to renewal written pricing decreases in workers compensation and the completion of the new business rollover from the Foremost renewal rights transaction. Excluding Foremost new business premium growth was up a very strong 13% for the quarter driven by workers compensation and package business.We expect continued new business growth to come from the launch of our next generation package offering we call Spectrum. This is much more than just a new product release. With this modular policy and the enhanced platform that supports it, we have taken our industry leading capabilities to a new level, making buying small business insurance easier than ever.A consumer buying small business insurance from the Hartford now receives tailored recommendations for their coverage or the ability to customize their own. Their agent is able to view real time pricing much the same way an online retail shopper can see a running total of the costs or products placed in their cart.As of today, we are live in 32 states and will be in 45 by year-end. We are already seeing increases in quotes and additional optional coverage selections. This game changing product launch only adds to our excitement about our long-term prospects for growth in this segment.In middle and large commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 99.6 improved 1.6 points from 2018 driven primarily by the lower non-cap property losses. Notably, in the marine losses which were elevated in the second quarter have moderated.Written premium was up 12% over last year due impart to the addition of certain legacy Navigators businesses within middle and large commercial. Ex-Navigators written premium was up 7% with strong production in national accounts, large property and programs as well as in verticals such as construction and energy.We are achieving rate increases across middle and large commercial, our property and auto rate increases are up sequentially in the quarter over a 100 basis points with liability not far behind. In global specialty the underlying combine ratio of $96.2 deteriorated 6.4 points primarily the result of including the Navigators book this quarter.Since the acquisition, we have been aggressively re-underwriting and reprising portions of the Navigators book. In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit rate increases on both the Navigators U.S. and international business with significant rate acceleration during the quarter and since the first quarter of this year.In the U.S., we achieved strong underwriting results in our management and professional liability and surety lines. We are also pleased with both renewal pricing and new business generation from our wholesale distribution channel in the U.S.In international, we have taken significant actions to address two plus years of sub-par returns in our Lloyd syndicate and London Market portfolio. In addition to the aggressive pricing actions, we are taking on this book we have exited certain underperforming lines and reduced significantly the number of binders, MGAs and line slips across the portfolio.We have also materially reduced the overall limits deployed in several lines including DNO, ENO and casualty. Our global specialty team is off to a terrific start they are active addressing opportunities in the book as well as taken advantage of favorable market conditions where appropriate.Integration efforts continue including expertise sharing and data science, technology, product design, claim and many other areas, executing across core risk functions will play an important role in improving the financial performance of this business. We fully expect global specialty to be a significant contributor to commercial\u2019s premium growth as profit returns to target return levels.Moving to personnel lines, the underlying combine ratio of 92.3 deteriorated 50 basis points from the third quarter of 2018, but still a very good overall result. The expense ratio increased nearly one point due to the impact of lower earn premium while the loss ratio will improve 40 basis points. The loss ratio improvement is reflected in both our auto and homeowner results driven by earn pricing increases and non-CAT homeowner experience.New business growth was up 34% compared to prior year, this is another positive new business quarter as marketing spend and product adjustments continue to gain traction. In ARP direct auto, our critical production levers including flow, close ratios and new sales all improved compared to prior year. Importantly, we are pleased with the underlying profile of this growth and encouraged by the improving trends.Despite continued strong improvement in direct new business growth, total written premium was down 4%, though we have made progress to improve the profitability of our ARP book, more work is needed on retention and new business to return to positive growth.In summary this is a very strong quarter across our Property and Casualty businesses, we are executing effectively against our plans while responding to last class trends and competitive market dynamics. We are taking appropriate pricing actions and making disciplined underwriting decisions. This is driving clear progress in-lines and accounts that need to improve overall profitability.Meanwhile, we remain extremely encouraged by the product breadth and depth of the underwriting talent that the Navigators acquisition is contributing and we are already seeing the impact of these additions in our businesses and with our distribution partners. The positive progress on key milestones drive my bullish outlook on our future. I look forward to updating you all in another 90 days.Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you Doug. Today I'm going to cover third quarter results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds Incorporate and provide an update on capital management. Our investment portfolio continues to perform very well with strong limited partnership returns and generally stable investment yields.Net investment income was 490 million for the quarter up 46 million or 10% from the prior year. Excluding Navigators net investment income was 462 million or 4% higher than the prior year. The annualized limited partnership return was 15.3% in the quarter due to higher valuation than underlying funds.Lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads increased net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax to 1.8 billion at September 30th up from 1.4 billion at June 30th. Unrealized and realized gains on equity securities classified and realized capital gains in the income statement were 19 million before tax in the quarter and 181 million before tax through September 30th.The credit performance of the investment portfolio remains very strong. Net interments in the quarter totaled one million flat with third quarter 2018 given the increasing likelihood of sustained low interest rates, I wanted to touch on how we manage the portfolio in this environment and the impact of the portfolio yield due to lower rates.We have a broad range of investment capabilities and a well diversified portfolio. Our strategy does not pursue lower credit quality for the purpose of making up for lower yields and we will continue to invest in a diversified manner. For the quarter, our current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.6% equating to 425 million.Taking into consideration potential lower reinvestment rates projected using the forward curve, we could see the portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships declined by close to 10 basis points in 2020 reducing the quarterly run rate of net investment income by approximately 10 million before tax.Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings of 39 million were down 5% from last year, but up one million sequentially. Daily average AUM was 2% from second quarter 2019 reflecting strong market performance partially offset by net outflows.Investment performance remains very strong, as of September 30th about 70% of Hartford Funds outperformed peers on a one, three and five year basis. Corporate core losses of 37 million improved by eight million from third quarter 2018.The principal driver of the improvement this quarter was 11 million of income after tax from our retain equity interest in Talcott compared to one million in third quarter 2018. During the quarter, we continue to repurchase shares, year-to-date through November 1st, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares for 126 million, with strong capital generation and financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders.During the third quarter, we issued 1.4 billion of debt comprised of 600 million 10 year 2.8% senior notes and 800 million, 30 year 3.6% senior notes. We used the proceeds to redeem approximately 1.65 billion of debt with the weighted average coupon of 5.3%.The redemption resulted in the loss on extinguishment of debt of 90 million before tax. We continue to plan to repay our 500 million, 5.5% senior notes maturing in March 2020, which will put us in-line with our leverage target.Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $42.55 up 8% year-to-date and 9% to September 30, 2018. Core earnings ROE over the last 12 months was 12.3% well in excess of our cost of equity capital. A few other items to comment on before I close. We have included disclosure in the 10-Q about the potential for subrogation recoveries on PG&E related to losses incurred uncertain 2017 and 2018 California wild fires.Given uncertainties with respect to approvals of the PG&E bankruptcy plan, we have not recognized any subrogation recoveries to-date. Based on subrogation claiming submitted all insurers to PG&E and the terms of the proposed settlement which is contingent upon approval of the bankruptcy plan, we would expect growth subrogation recoveries to be approximately 325 million, although the actual amount we collect is subject to uncertainty.The 116 million of any such subrogation recoveries would reduce reinsurance recoverable we have recorded under CAT reinsurance treaties. Accordingly, any benefit to income would be for subrogation recoveries in access of 116 million.Turning to fourth quarter, it has already been an active quarter for catastrophe related events. Our budget for cash in the fourth quarter is approximately 80 million pre-tax. Before considering any losses from the current California wild fires, we are approaching 80 million of catastrophe losses in the month of October including losses from Tornados in the Dallas area and other wind events.While it is still too early to make an estimate of losses we may incur from the current California wild fires, we are monitoring the fires closely in the areas we have ensured properties and businesses at risk. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter we will complete our annual study of asbestos and environmental reserves.Under the average development we purchased in 2016, we have $977 million of remaining coverage available for increases in these reserves. Also, we did not feed any additional net loss reserves in the third quarter to our adverse development cover for Navigators, so we continue to have 209 million of coverage available on that book of business.To summarize, the execution of our strategy is generating strong results across our business lines. The integration of Navigators is on-track and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.I will now turn the call over to Susan, so we can begin the Q&A session. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Yes. We will now begin the question and answer session [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ElyseGreenspan: Good morning. First off that they do, you know depreciate the new kind of stream line disclosure within the press release that was helpful this quarter. My first question for you is on capital. Just following up on some of your prepared remarks, it seems like you guys got the majority of the tax attributes you are expecting this year as the end of the third quarter just looking at the 10-Q disclosure. So I just wanted to walk through that and get a sense of repurchases for the fourth quarter and then for next year and then capital side could you just give us a sense of the dividends you could upstream from the PNC sub in 2020 and also there is any change in the tax attributes you expect as well? BethCostello: Sure. So first of all, thank you for the comment on the press release. I\u2019m glad that you like the new format. So as it relates to holding company cash, I would say overall, we are on-track with what we expected at the beginning of the year. Yes, the timing of the tax benefit we received from AMT refund did come in a little bit earlier than we anticipated.We were anticipating that this year. So we took all of that into consideration, as we have projected kind of our view of share purchases over the course of this year and into next year and we continue to target for this year about a total of 200 million in share repurchases then the remainder of our billion dollar authorization would be used in 2020.As it relates to then dividend streams as we go into 2020. Again, as a reminder we did not take any net dividends from PMC in 2019, but we do you anticipate going back to our normal cadence in 2020. As we talked about in the past we see dividends sort of in the 850 to 900 million range, obviously it will depend on actual results from our group benefits, business typically in the 300 to 350 range obviously results group benefits have been very strong. So, we have seen some increases in those dividends through the years.And then mutual funds usually isn't that 100 and 125 million. And then we do still have some remaining tax benefits that we would expect to receive in 2020 so when we look at 2019, we are probably a little bit over $700 million in tax benefits that will come through.And as we look to 2020 we would be just slightly under 600 million. So again, very much in-line with what we have laid out previously. And then again, I will just remind you as I said, in my prepared remarks, we do still anticipate paying our maturing debt of 500 million in March of 2020. ElyseGreenspan: Thanks that is very helpful. And then my second question on, if we want to kind of keep track of how Navigators is trending, you guys highlighted some earnings projections for that business going a couple years out. So just trying to get a sense can you kind of set the stage or give us a sense how much earnings came through in the quarter or is it best way for us just clearly look at the global specialty margin to get a sense of, you know how Navigators is tracking. ChristopherSwift: Elyse, thank you for your question. I would say what we have commented on the past as far as our goals related to the financial performance of Navigators are really unchanged. I think we did say the slope of it might be slightly different the components might be, slightly different.But we still see a path to earnings $200 million of core earnings prior to amortization of intangibles in that four to five year period of time and still excited. Obviously there is a lot of rate being taken in the specialty space broadly defined, but Doug that is what I would say over the long-term, but what would you say in the near-term. DougElliot: Just to add that this quarter we made very few adjustments to the prior Navigators loss ratios across fair line, either prior year or in the current action year. We tweaked on a liability slightly in the quarter, but other than that is a pretty quite quarter relative to actuarial assumptions. ElyseGreenspan: Okay. And can you give us a sense of the rate that you are getting just within their book of business? ChristopherSwift: Yes. I mentioned in my commentary Elyse, there was double-digits and in the quarter essentially the U.S. book was right on top of 10, internationally they were getting closer to 16, and when you put two together we are talking 12ish, 11 to 12 points of price. I also said that it was accelerating in the quarter, so we are quite pleased about that as you think about the run rate July through September and an early peak of October keeps me optimistic, October looks a lot like September. So, I think we are off to a really good start I\u2019m very pleased with progress, Vince and his team is working hard to change the outcomes here. ElyseGreenspan: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color. Operator : Next we have Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. PaulNewsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping you could way in a little bit more on some of the auto trends that we have seen at other companies, both the commercial auto trend and the severity and frequency seems to be a little bit different by company and kind of how you vary that. What you experiences have and so what you think is behind it. And then sort of second question, the private passenger and ask kind of the same question about frequency and severity in all see a little bit of the spike in their frequency physical damage and you have seen same thing. Those are my two questions. DougElliot: Paul, let me just clarify personnel and commercial both do you want me to\u2026 PaulNewsome: Yes. DougElliot: Okay. Let\u2019s start with personnel. We continue to be pleased by the trends we see in our personnel lines auto book, frequency has been in good shape for several quarters now and severity we are mindful of collision severity. But essentially a lot of trends are within our expectations and feel good about our progress and overall performance of the personnel line auto line.In commercial, a bit of different story and the sense that our small commercial book, much smaller vehicle, we have been working right now for five to six years, we have transformed that book. We are essentially not on mono-line players acceptance certain circumstances improvement there, but more improvement necessary in the commercial auto, small commercial space.In the middle, again, this is not a specialty auto sector, this is essentially commercial auto fleets attached to our middle market accounts, slightly heavier than the small commercial. We also have been chasing rate here over the last six to seven years. We have made progress, but not at all acceptable relative to our operating performance in the line today.So, we continue to make underwriting adjustments, we will continue to work hard on rate, very pleased that our rate was up over 10 points in Q3 and auto will continue to work at that in Q4 and into 2020. When I think about loss trends, they look to us like during the mid single-digits maybe plus a little bit in that five to six, 6.5 range commercial auto we are mindful that which means our pricing needs to be on top of that plus some to make appreciable progress in combined ratio. Chris or Beth anything. PaulNewsome: Do you have any particularly theory about the commercial business that might be different from other folks why we are seeing the severity trend and whether or not it is recovered? ChristopherSwift: I would just offer that our book of business on the commercial side ex-Nav is largely primary auto, so we are not a significant player in the excess space. I do think the excess layers have had some pressure over the past, three to four years.Navigators has especially auto book we are very mindful that, we are working closely with them sharing our trends working actuarial assumptions, et cetera and taking quite a bit of right there. So our rate change in the Navigators auto book is substantial. But I don't have any greater insight, because I don't have insight into other competitor books like I do our own. PaulNewsome: Okay. Congratulations for the quarter. Thank you. ChristopherSwift: Thanks Paul. Operator : Next, we have Brian Meredith of UBS. BrianMeredith: First, I'm just curious. In the commercial lines segment, the expense ratio declined year-over-year only around 17% growth G&A expenses as expected to be a little bit higher than that was there anything unusual there is as a decent run rate with respect to kind of G&A expense growth than what we are seeing with the expense ratio? ChristopherSwift: Yes, good question, Brian and there are some things happening in both Q2 and Q3 that make that compare a little bit challenging. So let me do my best to unpack it. In three quarter, we actually had some credits that ran through from Texas licenses and fees and also some bad debt credits. And when you kind of laser them in you basically get a quarterly expense ratio more like 34.5.In Q2, we had some one timers that put some upward pressure on the expense and I would also point out to you as the Navigators book comes into our expense ratios, as a typical specialty company sometimes they have got slightly higher expense base.So between the U.S. and certainly the international, there is a little bit of inflation on the expense coming in from NAB that we work our way through over the next couple of years. As we meet, we earn our way toward those profit targets we have talked about. So I look at the run rate to Q3 more in the 34.5 range. I think that is kind of where we will be Q4 as I look out. BrianMeredith: Great, thanks and then my second question, in a small commercial area, maybe you talked about how it is a little bit more insulated from the social inflation environment, given the limits profile of that business. I'm curious, have you seen any increasing competition in that area as a result of what is going in the loss cost inflation environment. ChristopherSwift: In response to I would say again across many of our businesses there is always competitive pressure, there is new entrants, there is things FinTech related or EsnureTech related activities, but I wouldn't say it is rapidly changing in a more competitive environment where everyone is piling in.I would say and you have heard us talk about this before. We have a 30 year history here with a lot of data, a lot of capabilities, a lot of deep trusted agent relationships that does provide an element of advantage to us.But we are really tuned in on the emerging trends in our own mindset of what do we need to continue to get better every day, whatever we need to do to continue to differentiate ourselves as one of the top go-to-market. So that is our mindset and Doug if you would add anything. DougElliot: Yes. So, maybe just a couple of comments about our new structure and then I will comments on what we work on the last couple of years. So, very excited Brian about this launch of NexGen spectrum, we have been kind of in the design and building stage for a couple of years now.And I think it is going to be a terrific product in the market much in the way the digital experiences that we are all use to on our personalize. Because of that launch we have been laser focus these last couple of years to get our rate adequacies on our spectrum product where they need to be because is very difficult if your profit challenge in the current line and then go to launch new product.So as we think about loss trends over these last couple of years, we continue to make sure we are on top of those trends with pricing, we see liability trends in that spectrum area still in the mid single-digits and our pricing has been matching that overtime and we feel good about our balance sheet in terms of the reserves that are recorded on our ledger. So, yes we have been very focused on loss trends here, I think good progress and now exciting that we launch our new effort into the latter half of the 2019 into 2020. BrianMeredith: Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we have Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. JimmyBhullar: Hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions for Doug and first on commercial line. How do your ability to take advantage of improving pricing and the overall market, especially given that you have got a big exposure to workers comp your prices are actually obviously under pressure. DougElliot: Well, we are optimistic that our non-workers compensation pricing continues to improve as I suggested that certainly was the case in Q3 and I expect that to continue into Q4. Yes, we recognized we have some headwinds on a worker\u2019s comp environment. I would again point out the profitability those books is excellent particularly small commercial.So we are mindful of those headwinds and navigating in the middle of account-by-account and being thoughtful about class selection and state and geography and small commercial. And so, yes it is a tale of two where we are working hard to improve our core pricing while we understand is a very competitive worker\u2019s comp dynamic that matters greatly to us. JimmyBhullar: And then on the personnel line, I think you have hope that at some point over the next few quarters you will start to see stabilizing premium and maybe an improvement in premium. But it seems like more and more companies are sort of shifting their focus from revolving margins to accelerating growth. Just comment on competition whether it is still rationale and your expectation when you can sort of get to flat deposit of premium growth in that market? ChristopherSwift: Yes. Jimmy, we are not going to give any guidance there on a specific drivers, but the overall focus is both organize comment or has been a growth orientation. But you are right, I mean it is a dynamic marketplace just because we want to grow and there is a lot of other competitors that are shifting to that same mindset.So the trick in that environment at least in my judgment is we got to remain discipline you got again segment appropriately your new business by states or territories that make sense for you compared to where your pricing is and the team is executing very well. It is just we are getting that the responses just not converting as many in new business opportunities as feasible. But, Doug that is what I would said. DougElliot: I agree, Chris and I think we lay out a supplement, you can see we have made very good progress on the retention front, I still think there is a little more work to be done there. And it is a little bit more list. And then absolutely, we are focused on adjusting and thinking carefully about what we do on the new business front, because we want to raise those levels of new business successes. JimmyBhullar: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next we have Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. RyanTunis: First question to Doug on I guess on commercial auto, just thinking about it seems like over the past decade I was talking about commercial auto development and it was like we have been talking about a probably more hardcore competitors, maybe not so much over the past year, but I\u2019m just curious to maybe hear your thoughts on the extent to which maybe you feel like you got ahead of some of these trends maybe in 15, 16, 17. And to the extent you are seeing something new what is new in this 2019 environment that you potentially had reserved for contemplated prior to this? DougElliot: Ryan thanks. Let us just start on the quarter and then I do want to come in because I think you are onto something relative to the prior trend. So in this quarter, we made an adjustment to our prior year development based on some large losses we had seen in our national account book.So it is largely national accounts, I would say almost all national accounts 80% of the changes national accounts, and it's something that we had not adjusted in the last several years. So really excited our national book.If you go back over five to six years, correctly stated we have been adjusting auto. I would say back in the 12 to 13 time period, we had a broader specialty auto book, transportation vehicles that caused some of the adjustment and actually raised our attention to this commercial auto dynamic that we have been working hard on for five or six years.So I would agree with if you have looked at what we have done in the commercial auto space on our reserves, and our current next year underwriting and pricing. This has been an ongoing work in process for us.We did some tuning in the quarter, more importantly, we continue to leverage the findings in our book of business to do the best job we can at underwriting and profitability book going forward and we are sharing them with Navigators as we come together. RyanTunis: Perfect and then maybe for Chris, just on the benefit obviously we are seeing some very favorable trends there. And I guess what surprises a P&C analyst is how well pricing seems to hold off. So I\u2019m curious in your view, how does the pricing cycle kind of work for group benefits. Have you seen any increasing competition in that area as a - group beneficial. I'm seeing this transition to workers comp over the next couple years? ChristopherSwift: Sure, Ryan. I would say yes we are performing very well and I said in my commentary, I think we provided enough data to say that there were a couple of one timers in this quarter. So I look at it that the quarter was roughly more in-line with 120 million earnings and an 8% margin.But clearly above our long-term views that we have guided here, which is still six to seven. I think the thing that you just have to keep in mind is a lot of the results that are emerging today are based on pricing and commitments we have made two, three years ago that are just outperforming.So unlike P&C, we generally make three year rate guarantees, we are very thoughtful and discipline in making those three year rate guarantees, because that is the commitment. So, we are just outperforming the expectations both on incidences and recoveries that is contributing to that current outperformance. So hopefully that helps you. RyanTunis: It does. Thanks. Operator : Next we have David Motemaden of Evercore. DavidMotemaden: Hi. Thanks, good morning. Just a question for Doug, just wanted to get a bit more detail on the changes that you guys made to reserves and GL and also just talk about what you are assuming on severity going forward and in your loss picks and what sort of rate you are seeking in the market right now? DougElliot: Yes that was a multiple component question. So let me do my best to working away through. In other liability, general liability we made some tweaks really across years, across businesses, I would say a series of small tweaks couple in the product area, a couple umbrellas, et cetera.Nothing significant in any one pocket, but largely across our middle market book of business. Construction included a little bit of our specialty, general liability book. So that really is the basis for the tweaking we did in the quarter for general liability.In a broader sense, we think about loss trends, overall our loss trends are somewhere in that mid single-digit range when you combine all our lines and I\u2019m thinking primarily about auto liability and GL which is two lines that really form the basis for most of your questions.So, they may move a bit between small and middle and some of our specialty lines with the global specialty book. But we are talking about trying to be on top of mid single-digit trends and now our pricing across various lines is either on top of slightly advancing on or - on top of in the case of some of our specialty access area.So, I share with you, we are really pleased about some of the specialty areas that we have had substantial movement in pricing double-digit moves in pricing where I feel like we are going to see the benefits of that kind of working into our book in 2020 and beyond. DavidMotemaden: Got it. Great. Thanks. And a question for just for Chris on the group business and top-line specifically sales were down a decent amount year-over-year. Just sort of wondering what you are seeing competitively and also more specifically what you are outlook would be for top-line earned premium growth here over the next few years as Aetna is more fully integrated? ChristopherSwift: Sure, David. I was trying to explain that, I mean it is still a competitive environment out there, but there is still an element of rationality that I see most of our competitors exhibiting. You might have an account or two where new business opportunity where someone does something more aggressive, but generally competitive but balanced.So we would say the year-over-year numbers that you are looking at does look down, but really when you adjust for the New York Family Paid Leave product that launched in 2018, you really have sort of $40 million delta between year-to-date, 2019 compared to year-to-date 2018.So, really you can consider it slightly down to flattish. So again I think we are still performing at a high level from our sales side, which is still some contributions to sales in that $40 million to $50 million range from Edna's medical staff that is still referring business and jointly selling. So we feel good about the overall sales performance.So I said in my opening comments, your premiums are slightly down 1% on a earned basis, primarily due to just higher lapses, lower persistency on the Aetna book as we are taking targeted actions, since to re-price in those books.So everything is according to plan, but as we look forward, I still see modest growth in top-line for group benefits, really supported by some of our ancillary lines anchored in ANH and voluntary. DavidMotemaden: Great. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Next, we have Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. MikeZaremski: Hey good morning. I wouldn't mind maybe trying to get more color on next gen spectrum, in terms of maybe you can isolate what the major changes are, from the commentary is it easier for your - the business owners to self service. I'm just curious, is there a direct selling component to potentially for small businesses and then also is there ultimately to measure the success you expect sales to accelerate or better profitability just anymore color would be great, it seems like it is a big deal? ChristopherSwift: Good question Mike and thank you for asking it. I would start by saying yes, this is a sales tool that essentially will sit on the desktop of our CSRs, Customer Service Reps around the country and all the agents and brokers we do business with.It is a tool that will allow them to be faster, more insightful and help their customers make choices, I would say inside the tool you should think about, good, better, best type dynamics. All the coverages, very tuned to what a certain customer or SIC class would require, what types of optional coverages are there et cetera.So, yes I think it is a best-in-class selling tool with advice that either comes out of the box with a terrific offer for a customer or offers additional coverages that a CSR will work with a potential customer to purchase. So that is the basis of this exciting innovation for us.And then secondly, yes we do expect overtime our new sales and spectrum to lift. It is hard to predict, but our expectations over the next couple of years is that we will see some change in our new business sales and we will watch that carefully and report on that as we go through time. MikeZaremski: Okay, that is helpful. Lastly, if we step back and kind of talk about in a broader sense about commercial pricing versus loss cost trend. Is it fair to say that - if there is a gap, it hasn't changed much quarter-over-quarter taking into account workers comp and so it sounds like there hasn't been any meaningful, notable changes over the last quarter? ChristopherSwift: And is your question more in the loss trend area or the pricing areas? MikeZaremski: It is on both, it is kind of seems like pricing is moving north and trend might be moving a little bit north. So net-net kind of similar to last quarter? ChristopherSwift: Yes, I would agree with your statement in the aggregate and then I think we would have to parse it apart by specialty by excess, by primary financial lines, spectrum et cetera. So in the aggregate, yes, we see lifting and pricing across middle, non-workers comp as we have examined our loss trends, I would say largely in the primary space pretty consistent with Q2.Yes maybe we are a little careful to make sure we are catching some uptick in the social inflation dynamic. But I don\u2019t think material in any given way. And then in the specialty book, yes we are spending a lot of time inside our excess, our umbrella, our specialty areas and we are mindful of where trends are expecting a little bit of upward lift in those trends and therefore our pricing has been pretty aggressive there. So, pleased with progress on both front, but I think you have it about right. MikeZaremski: Thank you very much. Operator : Next we have Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research. AmitKumar: Thanks. And good morning. Two quick follow ups maybe going back to Mike\u2019s question on rate versus loss trends. So if you blend I guess all the moving parts and look at small commercial. As we head into 2020, is your sense that the loss trend will end up running harder than what we expected hence the rate versus loss trend metric does not expand or is it more of a function of the book? DougElliot: So, Amit let me start and Beth and Chris can go over the top. We are not prepare today that to take into 2020 - what I\u2019m very pleased about is if you look at our metrics and our access combine across commercial and you see in for our segments. I think we have done a nice job at dealing with loss trend, getting improving rate performance and across both our most profitable segment, which is small commercial kind of holding in margins that are terrific.And we are mindful that we need to make more meaningful change in the middle and large commercial areas. So, I look at all-in Q3 number on top of Q2 and feel pretty good about it and as I mentioned in my earlier commentary, we know there was a little bit of upward pressure from NAV book coming in, we will work our way through that and at some point that will be a positive, because we will starting turning the tide on that number as we move into 2020. AmitKumar: Okay. Then on Chris or anyone had to add something to that. ChristopherSwift: Again, I think Doug is accurate as always. I think the tricks is going to be here everything is sort of more granular right these days, whether it be states, products, accounts so when you add it all up I think what Doug says makes perfect sense.My particular point of view is that this could be a dynamic environment for the next couple of years for sure. Because I don\u2019t think it is you know realistic at least in my expectation that 15 points of rate in the specialty book in aggregate is going to get back to targeted returns.As I said, particularly as it relates to Navigators we are taking a multiple year journey to get to targeted earnings and returns. And I think a lot of others are going to be in that same position where just one year of feeling good about high single-digit or low double-digit rates in certain lines primarily specialty isn\u2019t going to cut it and that is going to require a multi-year approach. AmitKumar: Got it. The only other question is on the last call. I guess we have fine tuned Navigators a bit and Chris on that call you had said one 10ish was sort of the number for 2020. Are we still in the ballpark or based on what has evolved, are we somewhere in the middle or not? ChristopherSwift: Yes. Obviously I\u2019m not going to give you any really specific details. But the ranges that we put out, I still think are valid as I said I would anchor in the low end of that range. And I\u2019m not changing our views right now at this point in time. AmitKumar: Got it. Thanks for the answers. And congrats on the print. Operator : Next, we have Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. GaryRansom: Good morning, most of my questions have been answered. But I did want to follow-up on the new spectrum policy and I wondered specifically whether there is a little bit of leapfrogging going on with other competitors in their own system. Can you actually detect when someone else has something, a new star offering and see a little bit of lowering of your quote volume then you put something out, you see a little bit of higher, and if you do, does that last for a while does it have some duration. I'm just trying to get a sense of the growth components and how this might play out. ChristopherSwift: Yes, thanks Gary. We do watch all those statistics carefully. So we are able to watch quote volume we are able to watch yield. So the number of hits or successful quotes against total quotes I would say relative to competitors rollout, we watch what they put out publicly and normally there is a little bit of a buzz or discussion about enhancements or innovations in the marketplace, I'm sure very similar to what is happening with our next generation spectrum offering right now.I think that is the easier way to find out about things. But we study the numbers, we are mindful of even the statistics I quoted in my script right, we are watching optional purchases - optional coverage purchases right now we are watching number of quotes. And we have an expected trajectory that we expect to see over the next three or four quarters and so we will be right on top of that. GaryRansom: Is this something that will roll out to all the renewals or is it just something for new business? ChristopherSwift: Yes, we are quoting new business right now. As I said, we are in mid-30 states and by year-end we expect to be essentially 45 and then we will deal with the last couple of states next year, but new business I think Gary today. GaryRansom: Okay. alright. Thank you very much. ChristopherSwift: Thank you. Operator : The next question we have will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. YaronKinar: Hi good morning everybody. I want to start with going on the reserve development in commercial lines and making another one on group benefits. So with reserve development I think in recent years we have seen kind of initial aspects in both general liability and commercial auto come in a bit below most recent picks for our prior years. Can you maybe talk about that dynamic and how comfortable you are with your picks for the more recent years considering the fact that you have an increasing the initial aspects there and is it just pricing that you have achieved that has offset some of the weaker picks in prior years? DougElliot: Let me start and then Beth can work over the top. I would say over the past six plus years, we have been working both pricing and underwriting. So we have been adjusting our offerings across the marketplace, in classes, monocline grouped with other accounts, et cetera. So multiple different options that we have been working.In general, I would agree with you that we have been light on our [XM] (Ph) picks at 12 months, which is the reason that if you look at our trend line, we have made adjustments to those prior year picks over the last six, seven years and I think we do a nice job of disclosing that in our in our supplement.So the disappointment is that last year obviously has been higher than we expected, and we didn't get the punch that we expected on the underwriting side. And so we are doubling down now, I think we continue to make progress again. I would separate some of this discussion by class of vehicle whether we are talking small commercial with primarily private passenger and light vans or middle market with some heavier or the specialty area.And I think that our success are like thereof is not very different than the overall marketplace. But what we have tried to do is when we see something in the book, we have addressed it both on our reserve levels and also on the underwriting. And that is why I don\u2019t think there is anything new here, we just need to dive even harder. Beth. BethCostello: I think that summarizes it very well Doug. YaronKinar: Okay. Thanks. And then on the group benefit side, the experience in claims recovery that you have seen for recent vintages, as you expect that kind of continue, is that baked into your estimate today or do you expect some of the version back I mean? DougElliot: You know I would say Yaron that obviously we update our statistic and views periodically that is what we did this quarter. So, that reflects our best views of trends going forward that in essence we price product on and book reserves on. So, it is our best thinking from here.Now, we have always talked about it, changes in incidence and/or recoveries is somewhat employment centric related. So as long as we don\u2019t have any big shocks into the system I would expect our estimates here to hold, but as I have said it is a dynamic world out there and when things change, we just have to reevaluate our assumptions and we would change accordingly. YaronKinar: Got it. Thanks so much. And thanks for sneaking me in. Operator : That is all the time we have for today\u2019s questions-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak : We appreciate all you joining us as well as your question. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any follow-up and if we didn\u2019t get to your question within the time period, I\u2019m available on, so please just give me a call. Thank you. Operator : The conference call is now concluded. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. At this time you may disconnect your lines. Thank you again everyone.",

Christopher Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2019 was an excellent year and a pivotal year for The Hartford. We set ambitious goals and delivered on strategic objectives while achieving strong financial results. Fourth quarter core earnings were $522 million or $1.43 per diluted share, an 84% increase over prior year driven by significantly lower catastrophe losses, exceptional results in Group Benefits and strong investment performance.For the year, core earnings were $2.1 billion or $5.65 per diluted share, up 31% from 2018. Book value per diluted share ex AOCI rose $43.71, an 11% increase for the year. And the 12-month core earnings ROE was 13.6%, an impressive result in the current market environment. Hard work by talented employees across The Hartford enabled us to perform at this high level.Turning to our results. In Commercial Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 94 is a strong result particularly in a year where we have incorporated Navigators. Just as impressive has been the speed with which the 2 organizations have come together as a focused team able to strongly position The Hartford in the marketplace and capture new business opportunities in firming market conditions.As the integration progresses, we are seeing more opportunities to improve underwriting profitability, cross-sell products, improve claim processes and leverage all the capabilities of The Hartford platform. These activities, coupled with continued rigorous execution on renewal pricing and retention, will contribute to our goal of achieving $200 million of incremental core earnings from the acquisition.In Commercial Lines, I am pleased with achieved rate increases across the portfolio with a focus on margin improvement. In Middle Market, renewal pricing excluding workers' compensation accelerated through each quarter of the year, culminating with a 7.1% increase during the fourth quarter. Personal Lines core earnings improved to $285 million as we benefited from much lower catastrophe losses with an underlying combined ratio of 91.9. New sales for auto and home were up 36% over prior year with improving retentions, all contributing towards the goal of future net written premium growth.Group Benefits had an outstanding year with core earnings of $539 million, up $112 million from 2018, with a core earnings margin of 8.9%. This performance was largely due to a 3-point loss ratio improvement over prior year, reflecting continued favorable disability incidence trends and strong disability claim recoveries, partially offset by elevated life severity experienced earlier in the year.On the top line, fully insured ongoing premiums were flat to prior year. Fully insured ongoing sales for 2019 were $647 million, down $57 million as prior year included first year sales related to the new Paid Family Leave product in New York.Persistency, as expected, was slightly below historical trends as we adjust pricing on targeted segments of the Aetna book. Overall, earned premium on the Aetna book is in line with our deal assumptions, and case conversions continue to go well from both a platform and pricing perspective. We are very pleased with the operational execution, integration and financial performance of Group Benefits.Looking ahead to 2020. We are expecting a core earnings margin in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%, which assumes moderate premium growth over 2019 driven by sales and improved persistency, a lower expected investment yield driven by a 7% limited partnership return assumption and normalized claim incidence risk and recovery trends in long-term disability. January sales were solid in a competitive market but were down slightly from 2019 due to fewer large case sales.Before turning the call over to Doug, I'll provide my perspective on a couple macro themes. First, social inflation continues to dominate industry conversations as the current hot topic. Last quarter, I said that social inflation was not a new phenomenon. A quarter later, my view hasn't changed. But there are a few points to make. I expect some level of social inflation will be felt by many carriers, if not all, across the industry. However, the impact on loss costs will vary by company. Variation depends on several factors, including the line of business and coverage limits; type of coverage, such as primary, umbrella or excess; specific contractual terms; and reinsurance programs. Each company's ability to react to social inflation will be impacted by the quality of data and analytics supporting product pricing and loss reserve estimates. At The Hartford, I feel confident that we are -- that our analytical capabilities, along with our talented claims and legal professionals, have allowed us to build a track record of making timely adjustments to loss cost assumptions reflected in our financial results over the past 4 to 5 years.The second topic is interest rates. For several quarters, we have discussed the impact of a persistent low interest rate environment on the ability to grow net investment income. Currently, our portfolio continues to perform well, but it is clear that the interest rate environment is becoming more challenging. This will impact the investment returns on new cash flows, reinvestment rates and our overall portfolio yield. The implication is that net investment income will likely become a headwind to core earnings growth, requiring higher levels of underwriting income to support earnings and ROE. This, coupled with loss cost trends, leads me to believe the firming cycle we are experiencing will likely continue for the next 18 to 24 months.In closing, when I look out to 2020 and beyond, I think about how far our businesses have evolved over the past decade and how well positioned The Hartford is as a market leader. We have expanded underwriting capabilities and provide a broad range of products delivered through multiple distribution channels to meet customer needs in a dynamic market environment. We are focused on execution, integration, innovation and maximizing our enhanced capabilities to organically grow the business.In Small Commercial, we are a top industry player and have demonstrated consistent financial performance and innovation over the years with a focus on the customer experience. We are growth orientated with a multichannel distribution strategy and expansive underwriting appetite to serve more classes of business.In Middle & Large Commercial, we aim to improve margins and leverage new product breadth. Pricing is improving, and we have identified attractive opportunities to cross-sell specialty products.In Global Specialty, we are newly positioned with a broader product portfolio and expanded distribution. In the wholesale and Lloyd's market, we will focus on integration and improving margins.In our Personal Lines business, we have enjoyed a unique relationship with AARP for over 35 years. We continue to look for opportunities to drive top line growth. And finally, in Group Benefits, we are nearing the completion of integration activities. Our focus now is on future growth stemming from new products and services designed to complement existing risk products while improving the customer experience.We enter 2020 well positioned in the market. Moreover, we remain committed to making a sustainable and positive impact on society as an essential element of our ongoing success. Across The Hartford, we're making this happen by always doing the right thing, fostering a workplace where everyone is welcome and respected, using our resources and influence to address the challenge of changing climate and helping to make our communities where we live and work be safer and more successful. I'm very proud that these sustainability efforts are widely recognized as industry-leading.In summary, I'm confident our enhanced capabilities in a firming market, combined with ongoing capital management, provide the opportunity for The Hartford to enhance value for all our stakeholders.Now I'll turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Elliot : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was a very good year for Property & Casualty. We're pleased with the underlying financial performance of our business units and the achievement of important initiatives we established for 2019. In Small Commercial, we continue to outperform with another sub-90 underlying combined ratio for the year and early new business momentum from the launch of our next-generation Spectrum product. In Middle & Large Commercial, we're maintaining positive traction across our industry verticals while we work to improve profitability on our core book. In Global Specialty and across Commercial Lines, we're leveraging the product breadth and underwriting expertise arising from the Navigators acquisition to deepen relationships with customers and distribution partners. Through year-end, we've delivered approximately $50 million of incremental sales across Middle & Large Commercial and Global Specialty that would not have been possible without the acquisition. This positive start provides confidence that we will outpace our 3-year incremental revenue goal of $200 million.In Personal Lines, the business had an excellent earnings year. We continue to work on driving new business growth, while moderating renewal written price increases have helped to improve policy retention levels for the year.Let me now pivot to summarize our financial performance for 2019, and then I'll conclude with some thoughts about 2020. Commercial Lines core earnings were $1.17 billion for the year on a combined ratio of 97.7. This includes catastrophe losses of $323 million or 3.9 points. Net favorable prior year development for the year was $112 million or 1.4 points excluding Navigators prior year development recorded at the acquisition date.In the fourth quarter, we reported $37 million of net favorable prior year development, which primarily consisted of favorable experience in both Small Commercial package business and the workers' compensation 2016 and 2017 accident years. This was partially offset by $16 million of unfavorable development primarily on Navigators international reserves.The Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio was 94 for the year, increasing 2.5 points from 2018. The Navigators underlying combined ratio is higher than our legacy commercial book and contributed approximately 1 point of the increase. The remainder of the increase was from non-CAT property, workers' compensation and higher commissions.Consistent with our expectations, the underlying loss ratio for workers' compensation increased 1 point from 2018, reflecting the competitive market and pricing declines. Loss trends were modest with negative frequency, while medical and indemnity severity trends were in the mid-single digits.Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.5% for the quarter, up 50 basis points from third quarter. Fourth quarter 2019 renewal written pricing was up 1.9 points from the fourth quarter of last year. Middle Market renewal written pricing in the U.S. excluding workers' compensation increased 5.2% for the year, up 2.2 points from last year. In the fourth quarter, the rate increase was 7.1%, up 1.8 points from the third quarter 2019 and up over 4 points from fourth quarter 2018. We have now seen increasing renewal written price increases in these lines for 4 consecutive quarters.Our Global Specialty book is experiencing even stronger pricing gains in both our U.S. wholesale book and the international portfolio, which is primarily written in the Lloyd's market. Our U.S. wholesale book achieved an 18% rate increase in the fourth quarter. Several lines were in excess of 20%, including property, auto and excess casualty.Our international portfolio also had strong pricing performance in the quarter with particular emphasis on professional lines and onshore energy. Ongoing underwriting actions, coupled with sustained rate increases in this book, will drive profitability improvement in 2020 and beyond.We continue to monitor loss trends in our book, especially liability. We expect 2020 primary liability and commercial auto loss trends to be in the mid-single digits. Excess liability loss trend will be a few points higher than primary. While our book is certainly not immune to the ongoing unfavorable tort trends, we continue to take underwriting, pricing and reserve actions to address this liability trend. Our teams actively monitor these claim trends and currently do not see significant shifts in either representation or litigation rates. This will continue to be a critical watch area for us in 2020. Overall, I'm very pleased with how effectively our team is balancing growth and profitability along with our pricing progress in the second half of 2019.Moving to our individual business units. Small Commercial had another strong year. The underlying combined ratio was 89.1 for the year, up 2.4 points from prior year, reflecting the workers' compensation pricing environment, higher property, fire severity and higher supplemental commissions. Total Small Commercial written premium increased 2% for the full year, with fourth quarter written premium relatively flat to 2018.Policy count and premium retentions remain strong, both up 1 point from prior year. And new business increased to $646 million for the full year, up 8%. In the fourth quarter 2019, new business declined from prior year primarily reflecting the increase in new business last year from the Foremost renewal rights transaction. Excluding Foremost, new business premium increased 9% in the quarter.Moving to Middle & Large Commercial. We posted an underlying combined ratio of 99 for the year, up 0.6 point from 2018 primarily due to higher commissions and technology spend. Total written premium increased by 9% for the full year, 6% if you exclude the impact of Navigators acquisition. We are achieving positive top line results from our investments in new industry verticals, particularly large property, construction, programs and energy. We're also growing our National Accounts business with written premiums up over 6% last year.The efforts to improve the profitability of our Middle Market book through rate and underwriting actions have intensified in the second half of the year. Middle Market retention levels were up slightly year-over-year, and new business premium of $584 million for the full year was up 8% versus 2018. However, Middle Market new written premium declined 11% in the fourth quarter compared to last year primarily in workers' compensation and auto. Premium retention was also up 3 points from a year ago. We remain disciplined with our pricing methodologies as competitors have been willing to write at more aggressive levels.In Global Specialty, the underlying combined ratio was 96 for the full year, up nearly 8 points over 2018 almost entirely due to the inclusion of the Navigators business. We continue to deliver strong underwriting results in our legacy, management and professional liability and surety lines.In the second half of the year, the underlying combined ratio was 98.5, 2 points above the upper end of our guidance we provided on the second quarter call. In the fourth quarter, we had several large losses written from our international desk, including a $6 million loss related to a Texas oil refinery explosion and a $4 million property and business interruption loss from a Florida tornado.The significant rate and underwriting actions we're taking across the Navigators book is pressuring retention in some U.S. business lines. Retentions are generally stable in the international book. With these actions, I'm confident we've established a path to meet our profitability goals over the coming years.Shifting to Personal Lines. Core earnings for the year of $285 million with a combined ratio of 95 improved from a 2018 core loss of $28 million. This improvement was largely driven by a $321 million after-tax decrease in catastrophe losses between years. The full year underlying combined ratio increased modestly to 91.9 driven by higher expenses, partially offset by slightly improving results in auto.The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved slightly to 97.9 for the full year. We've been able to stay ahead of loss trends. Year-over-year frequency continues to decline, while severity increased in the low to mid-single digits. Higher underwriting expenses due to increased marketing efforts combined with lower earned premium drove the Personal Lines expense ratio up 1.7 points for the full year.Before I turn things over to Beth, I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2020. In Property & Casualty, we're focused on several priorities. First, we intend to fully leverage the combined product breadth, talent and distribution capabilities we now have at The Hartford. We will drive growth in Global Specialty and Middle Market with deep product sets and broader distribution across both retail and wholesale channels.Second, we continue the underwriting journey to improve financial returns across Middle Market and Global Specialty. We intend to achieve strong financial performance as we drive higher written pricing in both domestic and international property and liability lines while actively adjusting our limit profiles and class mix.Finally, we're focused on growth initiatives with both Small Commercial Spectrum as well as our AARP new business. Specifically in Middle Market commercial, we expect renewal written pricing to remain strong during 2020. In Global Specialty, we expect renewal written rate increases to remain in the double digits. We'll continue to lean into this rapidly firming market to improve the profitability of both our Middle Market core lines and Global Specialty book. In workers' compensation, we expect continued pricing headwinds.As a result, we expect the 2020 Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio to be between 92 and 94, slightly better than our performance for 2019. Contributing to this improvement are improved results in liability and property lines partially offset by margin compression in workers' compensation as negative rates earn through our book.Personal Lines will continue to drive new business growth in AARP Direct. We are fine-tuning our product segmentation and expect new written premium growth in the low double digits for the year. For 2020, we expect to achieve an underlying combined ratio of 91.5 to 93.5. Reflecting back, 2019 was a very good year for our business units across Property & Casualty. Our results demonstrate a disciplined underwriting organization committed to achieving strong margins and seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. We're pleased with the progress of integrating Global Specialty and its positive impact with our customers and distribution partners. I look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year.Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Doug. I will review results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and Corporate and cover a few other items before turning the call over for Q&A. Our investment portfolio continues to perform very well with strong limited partnership returns and generally stable investment yields despite lower reinvestment rates. Net investment income was $503 million for the quarter, up $46 million or 10% from the prior year. For the year, net investment income was about $2 billion, up 10% over 2018 due to the growth in asset levels primarily from the Navigators acquisition and higher partnership income. The annualized limited partnership return was 11.9% in the quarter due to higher valuations on underlying funds and real estate property sales.Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax decreased to $1.7 billion at December 31 from $1.8 billion at September 30. Unrealized and realized gains on equity securities classified in the income statement were $73 million before tax in the quarter and $254 million for the full year. The credit performance of the investment portfolio remains very strong. There were no impairments in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, the current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.8%, up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2018 due to higher make-whole payments and mortgage loan prepayment fees. Before limited partnerships and nonroutine income items, we expect a before-tax average portfolio yield of 3.4% to 3.5% in 2020 driven mostly by lower reinvestment rates and the projected decline in short-term rates based off of today's forward curve.Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings of $40 million were up 5% from fourth quarter last year and up $1 million sequentially. Daily average AUM rose 2% from third quarter 2019 reflecting strong market performance. Net flows were a positive $218 million in the fourth quarter driven by exchange-traded products and fixed income funds compared to net outflows in fourth quarter 2018 of $1.7 billion.Investment performance remains very strong. As of December 31, about 62% of Hartford Funds outperformed peers on a 1-year basis and about 72% of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis.Corporate core losses of $39 million in the quarter improved by $7 million from 2018. The retained equity interest in Talcott generated $17 million of income after tax compared to $6 million in fourth quarter 2018. During the quarter, we completed our annual study of asbestos and environmental reserves, which resulted in a $117 million increase in reserves, which was ceded to National Indemnity under our adverse development cover, resulting in no impact to net income. Of the $117 million, $65 million related to asbestos, which is significantly less than the development we have seen in recent years as the number of mesothelioma claim filings was favorable to our previous projections. The increase in asbestos reserves was largely driven by an increase in average settlement values. Environmental reserves increased by $52 million in part due to an increase in estimated cost to remediate sites as required by state regulators.As of December 31, 2019, the company has incurred a cumulative $640 million in adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the ADC, resulting in $860 million of coverage available for any future net reserve development. As Doug noted, in the fourth quarter, we recognized $16 million of unfavorable development on prior accident year reserves related to Navigators' international business. While adverse development on prior year reserves is economically reinsured to National Indemnity under the reinsurance we put in place at closing, that benefit is deferred under retroactive reinsurance accounting since cumulative losses ceded exceed the premium paid of $91 million. This deferred gain will be recognized in earnings in future years when we will start recovering cash from National Indemnity. After the actions this quarter, we have $193 million remaining capacity on this ADC.As of January 1, 2020, we completed the renewal of the property catastrophe reinsurance program. For the per occurrence treaty, the overall coverage and per occurrence retention of $350 million remain the same. Within the per occurrence program, we renewed coverage for $200 million of per event losses in excess of $150 million for catastrophes other than named storms or earthquakes. Our co-participation on the $200 million layer is 30%, up from 20% in 2019. We renewed our property catastrophe aggregate treaty and lowered the attachment point to $700 million of aggregate covered losses with a fully reinsured layer of $200 million above the attachment point. Effective with this renewal, catastrophe events from Navigators business other than from the assumed reinsurance business are covered by the program. A summary of the details of the catastrophe reinsurance program is included in the appendix to the slide deck.In the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for $110 million. Since inception through January 31, we have repurchased 4.3 million shares for $254 million. In addition, yesterday, the Board increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 8%. With strong capital generation and financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest in our businesses and return capital to shareholders.Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $43.71, up 11% in 2019. Core earnings ROE over the last 12 months was 13.6%, well in excess of our cost of equity capital.In summary, 2019 was a very successful year for The Hartford. We generated strong earnings, closed on the acquisition of Navigators, and we are confident in our ability to continue to generate shareholder value.I'll now turn the call over to Susan so we can begin the Q&A session. Susan Bernstein : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Can you please repeat the instructions, Alyssa, for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Jimmy Bhullar : So I had a question first just on the workers' comp line, if you can sort of quantify how much you're -- what you're seeing in terms of rate pressure in the business. And then on commercial auto, you're one of the few companies that has not seen sort of continued adverse reserve development. I think you had some last quarter, but this quarter, your results were better than some of your peers. So if you could just talk about what's going on there. Douglas Elliot : Sure, Jimmy. Let's take each of the pieces. On the workers' comp side, two different dynamics, one with our small commercial sector where we're seeing negative pricing and have very little ability to do anything about it relative to underwriting. So those rates -- those negative rates flow through. On the Middle Market side, largely a flattish environment. And so that means we're dealing with account experience sector, performance and doing our best to work against the negative file trends across the various states. So that's the workers' comp situation.Relative to auto, I would describe auto as an ongoing work in process here over the last eight years. We've been working on auto, which is why I think you don't see the surprises in the quarter. We have strength in auto over the last 6, 7 accident years. We strengthened a little bit in the third quarter but felt very good about where our position was for Q4. So that's the reason there was no activity in Q4. Jimmy Bhullar : And then if I could just ask one more on Group Benefits. Your margins, along with everybody else, in disability have been very strong. How much of this are you seeing companies begin to reflect in their pricing as you went through renewal season? And is there any reason to believe that, at least in the near term, that the trend in terms of margins will reverse? Christopher Swift : Well, Jimmy, thanks for the question. I would say the market is competitive, no doubt about it, but largely still rational but competitive. And you're right. I mean we've been enjoying a pretty good run particularly with incidences and getting people back to work that have been out. How long this continues, I'm not sure I could predict. Obviously, we gave you our guidance for what we think is going to happen next year. And if I really sort of do a step change on where our margin is today to where we think it is next year on a normalized basis, I would say 0.7 decline due to net investment income, 0.8 of a decline due to again normalized loss ratios. And we're going to spend some incremental dollars in our infrastructure there. So there's a little bit of expense pressure.So we still see a good earning business in that 7-ish percent margin. And we'll try to compete with our competitors the best way we can on differentiating our services, our skills and our capabilities. Operator : The next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, when you guys had announced the Navigators deal, the goal was about $200 million of income over like a 5-year period. And so kind of half a year into the transaction, seems like margin's a little bit weaker. And now we also have the headwind of lower interest rates on investment income. So can you just walk us through, I guess, bridge us to kind of what the offsets are and why you still think you can get -- what would help you get to that $200 million target? Christopher Swift : Sure. Well, again, thank you for joining. I think you have the components that we've talked about. And the major ones are obviously net investment income, improved loss ratio performance and, to a lesser extent, expense savings. I think we also talked about, Elyse, on a short-term or near-term basis, we still see approximately $110 million of core earnings in 2020. And for the Navigators business, that will flow through the new Global Specialty segment. So that's again at the lower end of our range primarily due to the interest rate environment.But equally, in the past, the $200 million, and quite frankly, we think it's getting shorter than that 5-year period of time primarily due just to the rate environment and the improvement of possibilities that we are planning for and seeing in the book. Really pleased with the entire team, and Doug could give you more insights and analysis on it. But we're expecting significant rate with what we think is realistic loss cost trends that we're planning for. And eventually, those will cross and start to really improve.In fact, Doug, I think just my calculations and our analysis would say we're looking for a 5 or 6 point loss ratio improvement in the Navigators book next year, Elyse, based on activities that we're seeing today. Douglas Elliot : Chris, I would just add, absolutely that we are bullish about what we think we'll achieve in 2020. The other thing is that the accumulation of underwriting actions that were taken across the book between change in limit profile, attachment points, exiting classes, adjusting MGA capacity, underwriting limits, et cetera, are also going to be a core driver of that performance change. And I'm very encouraged by the actions that not only we've taken but will continue to take into 2020. So I think Vince Tizzio and the team have done a terrific job at resetting the book. Yes, we're encouraged about the pricing, and that provides an awful lot of our tone. But I also think we'll see the benefits of the labor inside our underwriting activities also play out meaningfully in our $200 million run. Beth Costello : Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, and I think Chris touched on this, but your point about our original projections on investment income are obviously correct. The rate environment is different. But we're also seeing more expense benefit than we originally anticipated, and the offset of those 2 pretty much wash each other out. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, as we think about capital return in 2020, is there any timing to think about in terms of when you can get some of the dividends from the subs or the tax attributes? Or should we just think about kind of even share repurchase throughout the four quarters? And then second question there, Beth, are there any tax attributes that we should think about for 2021 as we think about capital return beyond 2020? Beth Costello : Sure. So a couple of things. So as we think about the cash flow to the holding company over the year, I really see those building over the year. Some of the tax benefits come in over the course of time, but a big chunk of that comes in with the AMT refund, which is really predicated on when the IRS accepts our tax return and when that's filed. So from a pace of share repurchase, I would expect that to be increasing over the year and not necessarily ratable throughout the year.And then as far as tax attributes, when we look towards 2021, based on our expectation of utilization this year, I expect that when we get to 2021, we'll probably just be in sort of the normal course of tax benefits coming to the holding company related to the deduction we get on interest expense through our normal tax sharing arrangement. So it would be significantly lower than what we're expecting this year and probably slightly under $100 million. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler. Jon Newsome : I was hoping you could expand a little bit more on the Personal Lines operation and give us a little sense of kind of where we are from a pricing versus underlying claim cost environment. Douglas Elliot : Paul, sure, let me tackle that one. This is Doug. We're obviously pleased about our financial performance in 2019. You see the pricing is down a bit. I think it's down a bit commensurate with where we see loss trends. So as I've commented, frequency has been in very good shape for now an extended series of quarters. And we're watching carefully severity. We're watching physical damage in particular. But the aggregate of both frequency and severity put the loss trend in the low single digits, and I think that's where we are from a pricing perspective. So I feel like we're right on top of it.Now we also have goals to move our new business north. So we will address pricing and new business targets, et cetera, as we move through 2020 because we'd like to further stimulate new business growth. But I think we've done a nice job at getting the book healthy from a profit perspective, and we'll continue to balance both growth and profit as we go through 2020 and beyond. Jon Newsome : And then my second question is, I'd like to know a little bit more about persistency, particularly just across the property/casualty businesses. And normally, in a harder market, you have decreases in persistency. Do you think that's going to happen prospectively as well until the market climbs up? Douglas Elliot : Paul, there are so many pieces to the marketplace. If we talked about it on the extremes, you could move to Small Commercial, and I would say that that's just a very competitive world, not a lot of change from where we've been in the last couple of years. And then you could move into either public D&O or the excess casualty world that is going through enormous amount of change, and the dynamics around pricing and retention are very different across those sectors. So yes, where you see capacity shortage and people are driving rate because of their performance, which I think is where the market is and some of these challenged financial classes, there may be some dynamics across the retention element, but we are determined to get rate where we need it in our book.And so I think we have got a very good sense of where that rate need exists across our various products. And if we have to give up a little bit on the retention side to get what we need to do on the pricing, I'm willing to make that trade, particularly in Middle Market and Global Specialty where our returns have to get better. And you saw that in the fourth quarter. I shared with you that our new business was down slightly in Middle Market in the fourth quarter, but I was also really encouraged by our pricing advances. And I'm willing to give a couple of points of retention to do that, which is exactly what happened in the quarter. Operator : The next question comes from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Just for Chris or Doug on the Commercial Lines outlook for 2020. Maybe -- I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on the 92 to 94 underlying combined ratio guide after the, call it, 94.5% to 95% that you guys printed in the second half of '19. And I think, Chris, you mentioned 5- to 6-point improvement on Navigators in 2020. Just wanted to talk about just timing in terms of getting there and some of the other moving pieces that get you confident that you can get there given the results this quarter. Christopher Swift : David, let me start, and then I'll ask Doug to comment. So it feels like it's like deja vu all over again. This time last year, a lot of our tone was -- is similar to this year, right? You have a workers' comp dynamic that we are going to face some pressure with price, but generally, loss costs there are behaving. And then you have, I'll call it, all the other lines that I think will contribute to margin expansion going forward, particularly the specialty line.So sort of it's a tale of a coin there, 2 sides of the coin. But you put them all together and we do still see, at least from where our run rate ended in 2019, the ability to expand margins on an overall book basis, offsetting some of the pressure we see in comp with the strong pricing in liability, property, commercial auto and obviously our specialty line. So Doug, that's what I would say as sort of a macro perspective. Douglas Elliot : Yes. I agree with that, Chris. I would also add that we saw a little bit of a bump-up in the quarter for some accruals on the expense side. So the expense piece also is running a little abnormally high in the quarter. But when I adjust for the expense piece, some noise with Navigators and then the encouragement of what's happening on the pricing side, I really do feel like 2020 is achievable. Yes, we have a lot of work to get done to make that happen, but I believe we will. And I think we're off to a terrific start as we closed '19 and entered 2020 to get our numbers moving. David Motemaden : Got it. Great. And Doug, if I could just follow up, you had mentioned some adjustments to the limit profile that you were making for 2020. Just wondering if you could comment just in terms of what the average in limit size is for you guys ex workers' comp and what changes are you implementing. Douglas Elliot : When I talk about limit profile, I'm primarily talking about Navigators and our excess casualty book because, as you know, across the core HIG book, we're essentially talking about $1 million, $2 million limits, and we were not much of an umbrella player. Over the last 5 years, Navigators has been working on reducing its limits. So our average limits now are well down below $10 million and in very few places do we take limits greater than $10 million. So our normal book is in the $5 million, maybe in some cases, $10 million limit range. But that's where we play. And over the last couple of years, we've also been working hard at where we attach. So I would say that the profile of limit and the attachment point are keen in our focus, and we'll continue to adjust by class as we move through 2020. Operator : Next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Doug, I guess, first of all, on workers' comp, did you say in the prepared remarks that, that was a 1-point drag this year on the accident year combined ratio or just on the workers' comp picks? Douglas Elliot : I did, year-over-year, '18 and '19. Ryan Tunis : On the overall commercial? Douglas Elliot : Just on comp itself. Ryan Tunis : So that means the overall drag would be, what, maybe like 0.5 point on commercial here in '19? Douglas Elliot : That's a fair estimate to make, yes, Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Okay. And I guess in the outlook for 2020, are you thinking about a similar type of drag from comp? Or do you expect that to accelerate? Douglas Elliot : The 0.5 point across our book is what we're expecting in 2020. So when I think about all-in workers' comp across our lines, I think that's a good approximate number to use. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I guess just on Navigators, the 5 to 6 points, it sounds like that could come from 3 areas. It could come from, I guess, less unfavorable loss activity, it could come from rate, and it could come from underwriting improvement, remediation. If you had to think about those 5 or 6 points, how would you divvy it up between those three? Douglas Elliot : Well, rate is going to be the easiest to measure for sure. And I think based on the high teens that we posted in Q4, we're very positive about progress we're making there. I would add expenses to your pile. I'm not sure I heard expenses in your group, but we are working expenses. And yes, there'll be some expenses that come out of the equation. So that is also a part of it.The piece that will be most difficult to measure or quantify will clearly be the underwriting actions because they'll be embedded in losses and will be very difficult to know a loss that you've been able to either moderate or avoid versus an underwriting action taken. I don't think that's measurable. But the combination of those actions and our pricing activity against loss trend, to me, sets up the change that you talked about and that Chris and I referred to. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I guess my last one, Doug, is just thinking about some of the large loss activity. I think you said that was in international. And obviously, this business mix is a little bit new to you guys. If you could maybe give us some perspective on why a $4 million loss and a $6 million loss is, in fact, something that you have a handle on that you wouldn't necessarily expect to recur. Douglas Elliot : I think we've shared with you from the beginning that the core of The Hartford businesses were more frequency-based, and there's a bit more severity in the Navigators book. We've worked hard over the last 9 months to understand that better by product. As we move into 2020, our metrics will get tighter. Again, we've made and continue to make underwriting adjustments, appetite adjustments, et cetera.So as we looked at the fourth quarter and we looked at their property results, both domestically and also international, we just felt like there were a few losses that were beyond our expectations. And we booked them in the quarter and moved our accident year pickup accordingly. Again, as we roll into 2020, we still have to figure out what the right base is to launch from. But I feel like we have accounted for 2019 activity and know exactly what we need to get done in 2020 for us to make the plan that we've talked about. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Two questions. Doug, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on what David was talking about as far as limit profile at Navigators. Given the limit profile there is obviously a little bit higher, more property, should we expect this kind of large loss activity to be more frequent in your business going forward? Douglas Elliot : I don't think so, Brian. And I would actually suggest to you that we're spending a lot of time on their excess casualty portfolio as well. So their umbrella and excess limit product is certainly under enormous interest right now. The market is searching for capacity. And so I think we have deep experienced professionals in that space, a lot of interest on the part of many of our long-term Hartford retail brokers and agents. So the demand is up a lot for that excess casualty. We're using our capacity appropriate, and we're layering in actuarial, data science and all the capabilities that I think we bring as a firm. So encouraged about both opportunity, thoughtful about projections we're making, and we'll understand our book and adjust accordingly as we go through 2020. Brian Meredith : Got you. But the loss is sort of more property-focused, yes? Christopher Swift : Brian, it's Chris. Can I just add to Doug's point, including the prior questions? We've worked hard to get our arms around this book, and I believe we have. I think we have a deeper understanding of all aspects of the book, whether it be domestic or international.I'd remind you, we largely kept the Navigators reinsurance program in place that, again, on a closer-look basis, we think is well designed. And remember, part of the reason why we did the acquisition was because we like the people. We thought they were talented men and women that had immense capabilities in their own craft, in their own art. And we want to empower them obviously within a risk profile that we're comfortable with, we fully understand. But the execution day to day is -- was left obviously to Vince Tizzio and his team. And I think they're off to a great start in our environment, Doug. And we're growing and improving, and I think we're going to add a lot of value together. Douglas Elliot : Brian, maybe one other comment on the property side. I don't think -- and I'm not suggesting that what happened in the fourth quarter is this new trend to continue with every quarter, multiple exceptions to our P&L. Yes, they've had some noise in it. I think we are aggressively pricing the sector. I talked about an excess of 18 to 20 points of price in the quarter. We're also non-renewing a series of accounts. And in some of our tech sectors, energy sectors, we have loss ratios that are not sustainable. So we're working on those as we speak and intend to get our property book in line with our expectations going forward. Brian Meredith : Great. And then my second question, on the Personal Lines side. Just looking at the AARP Direct business, you talked about initiatives in place to drive double-digit new business growth. I guess my question there is are retentions -- are you happy where retentions are? And at what point do you think we could start seeing some actually growth in written premium in the AARP business again? Douglas Elliot : Yes. Good question. So generally, we are pleased with the recovery on the retention side over the last couple of years. I still think there's a little bit of lift inside that, maybe 1 point, 1 point plus. There's a lot of shopping activity in the environment overall in Personal Lines, so we're mindful of that. But we're both encouraged with progress and also hopeful that there's more to be had on the retention side.Relative to new, we have just improved our capabilities both on the desk and with our people, I think, enormously over the last couple of years. We continue to dial in our marketing activities. So I feel pretty good about that. You saw a 35%-plus change for the year in sales. I'm not sure we're going to get there next year with that kind of number, but we certainly expect to be up next year, as I described in my script. So encouraged by that and think that as we move through the latter half of '20 into '21, we'll see that growth move into positive stage for AARP Direct. Operator : The next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : Within Personal Lines, I guess, looking at the guidance, can you give us a sense as to the expectations for non-CAT weather losses on a year-over-year basis? Douglas Elliot : Beth, do you have the -- I'm not sure I have that handy. Meyer, we can -- let us go back and look at that one and see if we can help. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's perfect. And then switching over to workers' compensation, we've seen recently, I guess, some signs of medical inflation and some signs of wage growth at least in broader macroeconomic data. Are we seeing any change in severity trends within your book? Douglas Elliot : Our book is generally stable. So as we look at our long-term picks and our severity estimates, I think we're essentially in line. Now the last couple of years, we probably outperformed slightly. But as we move forward '20- '21, we have not come off our mid-single-digits severity picks, both medical and, to a lesser extent, indemnity. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : Two quick follow-up questions. The first question goes back to the discussion on the Standard Commercial Lines. If I look at the earned rate, the earned rate was 2.7% in Q4. And you're talking about the loss cost trends in mid-single digit in primary and higher in excess. So if I were to step back, is the thought process that earned rate will accelerate much faster than what you have seen and hence outpace the loss cost? Or how should that translate into margin expansion from here? Douglas Elliot : Yes, I think that's the right way to look at it. Our delivered written pricing in the fourth quarter extending into 2020 is going to move north the earned rate increases to get on top of the loss trends that I described. So yes, slightly disappointed that we have not been able to drive more pricing, and I'm talking primarily about Middle Market business U.S. And so we've been slightly behind, which is why you're seeing some deterioration in our margins in Middle Market. I expect that to turn in 2020. And the expectation is that we will improve our margins, as Chris noted, essentially in all our lines ex workers' comp. Christopher Swift : In fact, Doug, isn't it -- I think that the data that we have is ex workers' comp for Standard Commercial, which includes Small and Middle, ex workers' comp, our rate increase is actually about 6.4% during the quarter, which is that momentum that you talked about building and it's expected. And our execution is going to drive that continuation into 2020. Douglas Elliot : It is. The 6.5% is a pretty solid number. And actually, even in Small Commercial ex workers' comp, we've been at or around the 6% range now for about 8 quarters. So encouraged by that steady performance. And that's really been a good driver in terms of why our combined ratio, both underlying and total, have been in very good shape in Small. Amit Kumar : Got it. And then the second question I had was, in the opening remarks, you talked about social inflation. And you did mention it's not a new phenomena, et cetera. If we were to go back and compare today versus a year ago, based on the data you're seeing, would you say it's coming in, in line with expectations, slower than expectations or faster than expectations? Christopher Swift : Yes. Amit, I would say in line with expectations. There isn't anything outside of norm that we see. Doug talked about litigation rates and representation rates that have been generally stable for us over the last 3 or 4 years. So we've had to make some adjustments. We didn't get everything right over a 6-, 7-year period here, but I think we're on top of it. And we're managing the best way we can and being proactive, not only looking back at data but actually trying to think what can happen going forward. Douglas Elliot : Chris, and that's absolutely true for The Hartford book. What I would add on top of that is that probably in the excess area, we see a little bit more severity, a little bit more social inflation than maybe we expected a year ago. And that's also driving our price increases in the marketplace. So I didn't expect to be looking at a fourth quarter in '19, 12 months prior, in the mid-teens, but I think we need it. And as we better understand that book, we're driving the price increases that need to chase that loss trend. So I feel we're on top of it and pleased that our HIG book continues to perform about the way we expected. Christopher Swift : And Amit, that's why we did the reinsurance transaction with National Indemnity on Navigators was to really take that tail risk off until we got our arms fully around it. Obviously, we paid a premium for that, but I still like that trade we did given some of the uncertainty in the marketplace today on social inflation. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : First question on Group Benefits. Clearly, phenomenal results. Curious, Chris, in your prepared remarks, I believe you said you're kind of assuming more normalized incidence and recovery trends. So in the 2020 guidance, has HIG changed its incidence trend or recovery assumptions to kind of reflect an improved trend line? Or are you just kind of thinking last year was more of an anomaly? Christopher Swift : I would say, Michael, that our assumptions and methodologies are generally consistent over the years. We haven't changed anything in how we think about setting reserves or pricing product, which generally uses, I call it, a mean average approach so that we're not using the most recent dot in an incidence report. We're taking more of a five year period of time. So there is a little bit of mean averaging going in there as far as our assumptions. So -- but it's been consistent between years. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. Lastly, and I need to delve more into it, but it looks like the catastrophe reinsurance program might be purchasing a little bit more reinsurance. And if that's correct, that could be behind the CAT load guidance coming in slightly below last year's guidance. Is that correct? And if so, is there -- should we be baking in any -- a higher underlying loss ratio from the increased spend? Beth Costello : Yes. So a couple of things. And I would say, relatively speaking, our program is very consistent. We did purchase down in the aggregate treaty. And overall, when we look at the spend for the whole program and the various changes we made, it's really not a significant delta from the prior year. And as far as the CAT ratio guide at -- being in total kind of where we came at this year, that's not reflective of any changes in the reinsurance program. It's really just looking at underlying exposures and as we ran our models. And it's really, I think, only slightly down -- is down slightly from last year. Michael Zaremski : And Beth, if I could sneak one last one in. Did you -- is there -- did you comment on the -- on PG&E, whether that refund, has that come through? And if it does, would that be used towards capital management? Beth Costello : Yes. So I did not comment -- update our comments on PG&E. We continue to watch as that activity continues. We have not booked any recovery associated with the plans that are underway. We'll continue to watch what the final program is that comes out of bankruptcy. And yes, I mean overall, that -- any benefits that we receive, net of what we would have to reimburse our reinsurers for, would improve the capital position in P&C. But I wouldn't make a direct link to that to an increase in share repurchases. It will just go into the mix relative to capital resources. Operator : And the last question today comes from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : One more, if I could, on the outlook on commercial and from the expense side. I guess there's a lot of moving parts obviously on your expense ratio. You've talked about higher commissions defending your Small Commercial. I don't know when that ends, if you could talk about that. Investments, the benefits of which could accrue at some point, you're still making investments. So talk about the expense ratio there.And then Doug mentioned some accruals or whatever that happened in this quarter that kind of bumped it up a bit, so I'm not sure the impact on that. But as we think about 2020 on the expense ratio side, kind of what's a good starting point? 34.5-ish looks like maybe for the year-end. Is that a bit high? And how do you expect that to move in 2020? Christopher Swift : Yes. Michael, it's Chris. I would say, again, the context to the number that I'm going to give you is we've been on a program to invest in our platform, whether it be, call it, technology, whether it be digital, whether it be product and underwriting. We've been on a journey. And we've talked about sort of the elevation in our expense ratio primarily due to the invest side.I would say where we ended 2019 on a full year basis in that 32.5 to 33, Commercial and Personal Lines together, keep GB separate for the time being, is a good number for next year to maybe slightly down. I think we're coming to the point in that long-term program that we've put into place where the invest dollars are going to begin to slow down once we finish second half of 2020 heading into '21. I think we are a larger-scale organization or a growth-orientated firm that will continue to add premium, again, properly priced and good business.So all that would point to, particularly as we get out into '21 and beyond, I'll call it, a stairstep back to a normalized and competitive expense ratio over time. So -- but again, we've been deliberate about what we needed to do as an organization, we think, to create value and be competitive long term. And we're not backing away from that, but we're at the tail end of the program. That's what I would say, Doug and Beth. Michael Phillips : Great. Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess my last one, kind of more higher level. Chris, in your opening comments, you talked about the momentum in pricing. You were talking about the overall market, not just you guys, I believe you were. And I think you said you expect it to continue for 18 to 24 months from here. I guess -- hopefully, I heard you right. If that's the case, kind of what's behind that to you? That's a pretty long extension. And so what do you think is going to keep driving pricing up for the next two years? Christopher Swift : Well, getting to ultimately target ratios that support an adequate return for the risk the industry is taking. I outlined low interest rates. That's going to be a little bit of a headwind. But if I look at product lines and where comp is headed, I mean -- and again, from managing the book of business, you never really want to shock your book of business and go to a 50% retention rate. So generally, what you try to do is be thoughtful on retentions but firm and disciplined and work through your distribution partners to talk through the actions that are going to be required in the near term and over a longer period of time. And I just think, given where we're starting from and given some of the pressure on social inflation and liability cost, commercial auto in general, it's going to take two years to get back to target margins. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back to Ms. Susan Spivak for closing remarks. Susan Bernstein : Thank you, Alyssa.

Swift: Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. While The Hartford started 2020 with significant momentum, since our last call on February 4th all aspects of society and the global economy have been fundamentally changed by COVID-19. In light of that I plan to spend the bulk of my time today focused on the pandemic including how we are responding and how we are preparing for what comes next. I want to begin by recognizing the human toll the pandemic is taking on behalf of The Hartford and are more than 19,000 employees. My heart goes out to those who are affected by the virus. I pray for a full recovery for those who are sick and extend my deepest gratitude to the healthcare professionals caring for them, along with all the other workers on the frontline of this crisis.I also want to acknowledge the millions of people who are struggling in other ways, including those who have lost jobs and livelihoods, those who are trying to balance working from home with child care and home schooling, and those already vulnerable or suffering from the isolation brought about by physical distancing. People in businesses are facing circumstances they've never encountered before. Now, more than ever, they seek strong leadership at all levels across all sectors of our society to navigate through this crisis in a way that protects public health and safety and steer us towards economic and social recovery. At the Hartford, we are committed to doing our part.The company took quick and appropriate action in response to the pandemic. Our first priority was to ensure the health and safety of our employees and their families. Thanks to the investments we've made in our capabilities over the past several years and the extraordinary recent work of our technology team, we were able in mid-March to immediately and seamlessly transition more than 95% of our employees to a virtual environment. Since then, our team has continued to provide uninterrupted support and outstanding service that our customers expect. I'm incredibly proud of the resiliency demonstrated by our employees and their commitment to our stakeholders during this crisis, which speaks to The Hartford's character.We have also taken a number of steps to help our policyholders navigate through this crisis, including providing payment flexibility, refunding personal auto customers, and making premium adjustments for changes in exposure all of which Doug will comment upon further. We have also significantly increased our communication efforts with agents, brokers, and customers in the hopes of reducing some of the uncertainty they face during this unique time. To support our communities, The Hartford has donated in excess of $1 million to several organizations on the frontline of this crisis, including the CDC and the Center for Disaster Philanthropy. And we have enhanced and accelerated our annual campaign supporting regional food banks like Food Share.As we have reacted to the immediate impacts of the pandemic on our customers and operations and the world around us, we've maintained a strong focus on preparing for the next normal. We've entered 2020 in a position of strength, focused on execution and in the first quarter, we continued to generate an industry leading 12 month core earnings ROE of 13.3%. First quarter results and our Property and Casualty business benefited from pricing momentum, lower catastrophe losses, favorable non-catastrophe weather, and lower auto claim frequency. As a navigator's integration progresses -- underwriting actions to improve profitability, coupled with rigorous execution of renewal pricing and rate increases are driving an improvement in underwriting margins compared to the second half of 2019.The business impact from COVID-19 was approximately $50 million pre-tax in the first quarter including $16 million of increased claims in short-term disability and from expanded benefits under New York's revised disability and paid family leave legislation. A $10 million reduction in estimated auto premiums receivable and a $24 million increase in the allowance for current expected credit losses on premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables, and other balances. Doug will provide additional details on our Property and Casualty results.Before I return to the topic of COVID-19 and how we are thinking about the next normal, I'll spend a few moments addressing our first quarter Group Benefits performance. For the quarter Group Benefits posted core earnings of $115 million with a margin of 7.8%. These results were above expectations and reflect the strength of our book of business. Persistency and the combined employers block of business was approximately 88%. It was a solid sales quarter across market segments and product lines with fully insured ongoing sales of $385 million. The overall loss ratio improved by 2.8 points, driven by favorable life, involuntary results which were partially offset by increased disability loss ratio. Excluding the effects of COVID-19 previously discussed disability underlying trends remain favorable with strong recoveries in recent accident years. Incidents trends were consistent with recent experience, albeit slowing year-over-year improvement.As we look forward, we anticipate increased claims activity from COVID-19, primarily in short-term disability and life insurance as well as statutory paid family leave benefits in certain states. The virus has proven so far to be less acute for individuals under the age of 65, which is the vast majority of our business. However, it is clear that people of all age groups and demographic profiles are at some level of risk. We expect higher claim volumes in all these lines throughout the second quarter. Beyond that, the variables driving elevated losses are highly dependent on how well the virus is contained and ultimately treated. More broadly, the economic impacts of efforts to contain COVID-19 is also a factor to be considered as we look forward.We are facing a recessionary environment that was triggered by a very unique circumstance and historical correlations may not prove to be predictive. Nonetheless, disability incidence levels may increase over the next 12 months. We had been anticipating some increase previously, however, COVID-19 may accelerate and deepen that trend. We are adapting rapidly to all these changes operationally and in pricing and underwriting. Our most important priority is to meet the needs of our customers and our employees during the crisis. The group benefits business is a market leader and enters this period of uncertainty with a strong operational and financial foundation. I am confident we will emerge from this pandemic in a continued strong position.Now, I'd like to make some general comments about the challenges we face as a country, the role of the insurance industry, and how I think about The Hartford's future. The economic challenges we face are truly unprecedented. The shelter at home mandates shut down entire sectors of the economy, leading to a projected 25% decline in GDP in the second quarter, a 25% drop in our estimated new business startups in the last six weeks, unemployment rates above 10%, and historically low interest rates. We applaud the Federal Reserve, the Trump administration, and Congress for taking quick and necessary steps to assist the capital markets and support local businesses and individuals. These early steps have provided critical assistance to our economy and the American people.Only the federal government has the tools and resources to address the extraordinary threat posed by this fast moving global pandemic and the economic fallout from the necessary orders closing businesses across the country. That said it will take significant partnership and coordination between federal, state, and local governments along with help from the private sector known for profits and the American people to defeat this virus and safely reopen the economy. As always, the insurance industry will play a critical role in helping the country return to growth and prosperity.As an industry, we are actively paying claims resulting from COVID-19. The Property and Casualty sector entered the year in a strong position, but the sharp downturn we are experiencing will pressure growth and profitability. While the industry is prepared to meet its current obligations, it cannot accept retroactive changes to its policy obligations. There's been a lot of debate and discussion in the media and various legislatures across the country about business interruption. The vast majority of The Hartford's property policies that include business interruption in civil authority coverage require losses to be caused by direct physical damage or loss to property. Any effort to retroactively rewrite these contracts, presume coverage, or remove exclusions would threaten the very foundation of the insurance industry, the sanctity of contracts under our Constitution, and the principles of a free market economy. Doing so would threaten the ability of carriers to pay losses rising out of everyday covered perils our customers will inevitably face in the months and years ahead.We understand that policymakers and regulators are under extraordinary pressure to provide even more assistance to businesses they represent, but unlawfully and unconstitutionally shifting those losses from one industry to another is not the answer. The industry has an obligation to vigorously defend the terms and conditions of its insurance contracts and preserve the principle that premiums are paid for specific risks covered by the insurance policy.Turning to The Hartford, some of our businesses will be impacted more significantly than others. The size and duration of the impact will depend on the pandemic's ultimate effect on the economy. We expect elevated claims activity in such lines as workers compensation, short-term disability, surety, and [indiscernible]. We also expect to see some exposure's decline and while it's still very early, we anticipate corresponding declines in claims. We also expect additional pressure on net investment income. In short, we believe this to be an earnings event not a capital event.Well, these days are certainly the most turbulent of our generation. I remain confident about The Hartford's ability to manage the uncertainty of this crisis over the coming quarters. We have a strong and well capitalized balance sheet with ample liquidity. When we defeat this pandemic, there will be inevitably significant shifts in consumer spending habits, forcing businesses to change how they operate. We will be ready with products to meet the changing needs of our customers. Small business is the backbone of the U.S. economy and we will play an integral part in the eventual recovery. The Hartford as the leading insurer of small business will continue to protect our customers against the covered losses they face every day, allowing them to return with confidence to financial self-sufficiency and growth. We will continue to work with the federal government to create innovative tools the administration can use to provide assistance to those who need help. We will work alongside our peers, policymakers, elected officials, and public health experts to develop a national solution for managing pandemic risk going forward in support of a resilient and well functioning economy.My optimism for the future of society, the economy, and our company is grounded in The Hartford's history. For more than two centuries we have navigated through a host of global crises, including multiple recessions, two world wars, and the 1918 influenza pandemic. Based on the resiliency that is core to who we are, I believe we will emerge from this crisis even stronger. As we have always done, we will continue to leverage our expertise, capabilities, experience to deliver on the promises set forth in our policies. This means prudently managing our business to ensure we are able to meet our financial obligations many years into the future. Most of all, it means approaching every customer interaction with transparency, speed, and empathy.Our company's purpose is clear, we underwrite human achievement. We know who we are and what we stand for. Circumstances have changed and we must remain agile in response but we are unwavering in our commitment to our customers, our partners, our communities, and our people. With the combination of our heritage, talented and dedicated employees, and our strategy for future success, I am confident that we have what we need to thrive. Now, I will turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Elliot : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I echo your sentiment for those individuals and families impacted by COVID-19, as well as our deep appreciation for frontline workers who are protecting and supporting all of us. Against that backdrop let me share a commentary on the first quarter as well as perspective on our business in the face of this pandemic. Property and Casualty had a solid first quarter. Core earnings were slightly better than both last year and our expectations. I'm pleased with the continued pricing momentum that is critical to improving the financial performance of both middle market and global specialty.Let me get right into our business results. Commercial lines first quarter combined ratio was 99.1, increasing 3 points versus 2019. The underlying combined ratio was 94.9 increasing 2.2 points. The deterioration was primarily due to expected compression and workers compensation margins in small commercial, higher expenses and the inclusion of Navigator's partially offset by favorable non-CAT property results. For the quarter with no written pricing in standard commercial lines was 3.8%, up 30 basis points from fourth quarter. Excluding worker's compensation, pricing was 7.4%, up nearly a point over fourth quarter, including incremental monthly progress over the past three months.In middle market, renewal written pricing in the U.S., excluding workers compensation, increased 9.4%, up 180 basis points from fourth quarter and 570 basis points from first quarter of 2019. Both property and general liability pricing improved over 2 points since the fourth quarter and are now each in the high single-digits. In middle market, excluding workers compensation we've now achieved incremental pricing gains for five consecutive quarters.On our last call I provided quite a bit of texture to the pricing story in global specialty. Let me provide a few updates. We continue to experience strong pricing gains in both our U.S. wholesale book as well as the international portfolio, which is primarily written in Lloyd's. The U.S. wholesale book achieved 21 points of rate in the first quarter, over 2 points better than the fourth quarter. Several lines continued to achieve in excess of 20%, including property, auto, and excess casualty. The international portfolio also had equally strong pricing gains with continued emphasis on professional lines and energy. Additionally, considerable portfolio reshaping continues, including shifting industry and geographic mix, raising attachment points, and reducing policy limits. Combining these actions with our sustained pricing work, I'm pleased with the improving profit trajectory.Let me pivot to Property and Casualty's loss results. Catastrophes were relatively modest and outside of the unfavorable development on U.S. Ocean Marine and Lloyd's Syndicate Reserves that were covered by ADC, prior year development on all other lines was insignificant in the quarter. COVID-19 loss trends were immature at March 31 and therefore had a limited impact on our results.Let me share a few more details on our commercial businesses, beginning with small commercial, which had another very strong quarter, posting an underlying combined ratio of 89.3. The current accident year loss ratio improved eight tenths of a point as favorable non-CAT property results more than offset the margin compression in workers compensation. As discussed in the past, this expected compression was driven by negative workers compensation pricing. In addition, as you'll see across property and casualty segments, expense ratio deterioration was driven by lower 2019 state tax assessments and a higher bad debt allowance recorded this quarter. The bad debt allowance increase was 12 million in small commercial and 18 million across property and casually reflecting the expected impacts of higher customer defaults.Small commercial written premium was flat to last year. Our new business sales for the quarter were 157 million, down 10%. This decrease was driven by the new business written in 2019 from the foremost renewal rights transaction. Middle and large commercial reported an underlying combined ratio of 100.4 in the first quarter, an increase of 2.3 points. In addition to the expense items mentioned earlier, approximately 1 point of the increase related to a higher current accident year loss pick for general liability.Written premium increased 5% driven by strong growth in loss sensitive construction and the addition of the Navigator's retail excess casualty business. Retention and new business production and standard commercial middle market business both declined due to rate and underwriting actions we're taking across the book. In global specialty the underlying combined ratio was 96.4, improving 2.1 points from the second half of 2019. As I mentioned earlier, pricing and book reunderwriting actions are drivers of the improved results. In addition, global specialty delivered 217 million of direct new written premium in the quarter. We remain very encouraged about the breadth of our new product offerings and the long range core earnings forecasts for global specialty.Shifting over to personal lines, we're pleased with the performance producing an underlying combined ratio of 86.6, improving 2.5 points from a year ago. In personal lines auto, the underlying combined ratio of 90.9 was 2.7 points better than 2019. Favorable frequency trends driven by the relatively mild winter and shelter in place guidelines contributed to the improved results. Severity was largely in line with expectations.Now let me step back from our business results and reflect on the new challenges that COVID-19 will bring over the coming quarter and into the rest of the year. Operationally, we executed flawlessly. In a matter of days from decision to execution almost our entire team moved to fully remote status without missing a beat. The resiliency of our employees and their dedication to brokers and customers during the past seven weeks has been inspiring. As we look ahead to the next few months I would offer a few key points as it relates to the global pandemic. First, we communicated adjustments to normal business practices, including providing additional time to pay premium and offering flexible payment options. Extending billing grace periods through May 31st and the waiver of any late fees that would otherwise apply. Relaxing policy, renewal requirements, and deadlines as well as premium audit obligations and adjusting policy conditions to be responsive to extended vacancies caused by shelter in place guidelines. In addition, since mid-March, we've endorsed more than 80,000 policies and returned over 15 million of premium to customers. We've also announced a 15% refund of April and May's personal auto premium due to a reduction in miles driven and lower reported claims.Second, we expect that COVID-19 will have an impact on our premium flows. Let me start with small commercial. We expect our normally strong retention's to be impacted by both reductions and exposure, as well as business closures. Reductions and exposure will likely be driven by lower customer payroll and sales primarily impacting workers compensation, but also our business owners policy spectrum to a lesser degree. Our new business activity clearly slowed in the latter half of March and into April consistent with U.S. Census Bureau statistics that point toward an approximate 25% decline in national new business applications. We expect a similar drop in new business premium for the full second quarter. Written premium could be down approximately 15% in the second quarter. Relative to middle, large and specialty, we expect retention and pricing trends in the second quarter to remain generally consistent with prior quarters. Risk managers are juggling many priorities, and I expect customers will change carriers less often in this environment. This obviously means that new business levels will be off. Exposure reductions by way of endorsement will continue but not to the extent of small business.Finally, there's been much written about losses related to the virus, much of it misinformed. We continue to pay claims according to our contract terms and conditions. As Chris said, we will vigorously defend against any and all attempts to unfairly disregard or broaden the terms and conditions of our policies. These contracts have formed the foundation for our industry over decades. We will contest retroactive changes at every corner. As I close, let me again express my confidence in my teammates here at The Hartford. We've built a strong foundation for our future. Our insurance and risk management platform is poised for greater success as both organic and new capabilities blend together. We'll be thoughtful with our decisions dealing with this pandemic, and we will continue to be the company our customers, agents, and shareholders can count on. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Doug. I will review results for the investment portfolio, Hartford funds, and corporate and cover a few other items before turning the call over to Q&A. Before I begin with a discussion of our investment results, I'd like to point out that we have included new supplemental information on our investment portfolio this quarter in the appendix of our earnings slide presentation. Our investment portfolio is broadly diversified and high quality, with an overall average credit rating of A Plus. As the business cycle aged over the last couple of years we were active in reducing the risk profile of the portfolio and as a result have relatively small allocations to below investment grade securities, equities, and limited partnerships.The fixed maturity portfolio is 96% investment grade with nearly three quarters of that rated A or better. The corporate exposure to higher risk industries including energy, leisure, and entertainment and airlines is very manageable and largely investment grade with a significant percentage and private placements that offer covenants to better protect our investment. We deliberately seek to diversify our corporate and municipal risk through our allocations to structured products and commercial mortgage loans. Our structured product holdings are very high quality with an average rating of AA Plus and 95% rated single A or higher. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified with a loan to value ratio of 52% and debt service coverage of about 2.5 times coming into this crisis with no exposure to hospitality or retail malls.In addition since the end of March we reduced our equity exposure taking advantage of the bounce in equities to further reduce risk investing the proceeds primarily in high quality fixed income investments. Net investment income was 459 million for the quarter down 44 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 driven in part by lower income from make whole [ph] payments and mortgage loan prepayment and valuation declines on equity fund investments in first quarter 2020. For the quarter the current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.3%. For the second quarter we would expect the yields to be flat with the first quarter. We have taken actions to increase liquidity to offset the expected decrease in premium receipts to the COVID-19 including the effect of the billing relief that we have provided to our policyholders. For the second quarter yield outlook of 3.3% the impact of this increase in liquidity is roughly offset by the assumed absence of the valuation declines in equity fund investments experienced in the first quarter.The annualized limited partnership return was 13.2% in the first quarter primarily due to strong private equity valuations and distributions. As a reminder LP returns are reported on a quarter lag so we would expect to see second quarter results negatively impacted by the market decline in the first quarter. The net unrealized gain position of $600 million after tax on fixed maturities decreased by 1.1 billion from year-end driven predominantly by significantly wider credit spreads partially offset by lower interest rate. Unrealized and realized losses on equity securities net of gains on equity derivatives which are recorded within net realized capital losses in the income statement were 311 million before tax in the quarter reflecting the impact of the equity market decline. During the quarter we recorded impairments of 17 million pretax in our fixed maturity portfolio consisting of 12 million of credit impairments and 5 million of intent to sell impairments.Turning to Hartford funds, core earnings of 44 million were up 57% from first quarter of 2019 and up 4 million from the fourth quarter of 2019. Core earnings in the quarter included a benefit of 12 million pretax driven by a reduction in the contingent consideration payable related to the 2016 Lattice acquisition. Assets under management for our exchange traded products on which the contingent payment is based are down significantly due to market declines. Excluding this adjustment first quarter core earnings would have been 35 million compared to 28 million in the 2019 first quarter, reflecting higher average AUM of 7% despite the decline in AUM at the end of the first quarter which was down 20% from December 31st.Gross sales were up significantly in the first quarter from prior periods. However, net flows were a negative 1.4 billion in the first quarter driven by redemptions compared to net positive flows in first quarter 2019 of 874 million. The corporate core loss was 64 million in the quarter compared to a core loss of 15 million in the first quarter of 2019. The retained equity interest in Talcott which is reported on a one quarter lag generated a 3 million loss after tax in first quarter 2020 compared with income of 22 million after tax in the first quarter of 2019. In addition net investment income in corporate was down 15 million before tax from the prior year period due to a decline in invested assets for holding company primarily due to the acquisition of Navigators in the second quarter of 2019 and the impact of lower short-term investment yields. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $44.07 up 1% from year end 2019. Core earnings ROE over the last 12 months was 13.3%.We ended the quarter with approximately 800 million in holding company resources. In March we repaid 500 million of maturing debt with a coupon a 5.5%. In the first quarter we repurchased 2.67 million shares for $150 million. We have assessed our capital and liquidity positions under a number of stress scenarios and are very confident in our ability to manage through this period. Nonetheless in light of the uncertainty in the current environment we have paused our share repurchase activity and we'll evaluate the appropriate time to resume repurchases as the impact of COVID-19 become more known including loss cost trends, potential reduction written premium, and the impact of extending payment terms to our policyholders.Since March we have focused as a company on managing the dynamic conditions of this pandemic. We have taken action to increase liquidity on our balance sheet, further reduce risk in our investment portfolio, and proactively support our customers in this difficult time. We will continue to monitor the external environment including economic developments and take appropriate actions as we navigate through this changing landscape. I'll now turn the call over to Susan so we can begin the Q&A session. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. I'd ask if you could please repeat the instructions operator for asking a question. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yeah, thank you. A couple of questions here; first, Chris and Doug could you perhaps comment on the business interruption to coverages and specifically how much of your business in the property and kind of that business has a virus endorsement on it, so where your exposure there is? And then additionally could you comment on what percentage of your policy actually has a specific virus exclusion with respect to the business interruption coverage? Christopher J. Swift: Brian, thank you. Hope you're well. So, I would say a couple things one, I was -- confident in our underwriting and contractual terms and we've really done an exhaustive review over last six to seven weeks of all our policies including Navigators. And I would just tell you straight up that the vast, vast majority of our contracts do have a virus exclusion. And that there could be a handful of occasions where in essence we've offered business interruption coverage without tied to a physical damage or property loss. But again a handful and those policies actually came from our Navigators acquisitions. So I think we've got our arms around our policies, our exposures, our teams have really scrubbed everything over and over. But Doug that's what I would I would share with Brian. Douglas Elliot : I think that's a good summary Chris. Brian Meredith : Did you book those ones with the endorsement in the quarter? Christopher J. Swift: You know what I would say when we closed out the quarter, obviously we booked what we know. And that's why we have took the actions that you saw where we did from a receivable side, a credit side, from the group benefit side. And that's what we booked. We booked what we saw, what we were aware of. And, I would say specifically no, there was no specific provision for the handful of those policies that I referred to that do have BI but relatively I will call it modest in totality. Brian Meredith : Got you and then second question, could you comment on the impact of the expanded it's going to cover we're seeing in workers' comp in various states. Lots of numbers being thrown out there by some of the kind of industry and CCI, etc, etc. What are your thoughts on that, what's the potential impact on The Hartford, etc? Christopher J. Swift: Yeah, well it's as you said it's been active. And again as I said in my prepared comments I understand that people are trying to take care of people in their states, employees, and things like that. But if you really studied the history of the worker's comp environment over the last 50 years it's a well functioning, well understood business activity that I think fairly compensates people that have been injured or obviously get sick at work. And we've had some prior experience with this particularly with Ebola. So I think the rules of the road are generally understood and to expand presumptions, to relax documentation that sort of change the equation, I think as you see could be very disruptive to the industry. That said I guess I do have some personal sensitivities and for help frontline health care workers and those that are treating the sick out of this virus and maybe there's a combinations or things that we could do there. But broad based presumptions for many classes of business Brian just doesn't make sense to me. Douglas Elliot : Brian the only thing I would add is that several states are talking about this presumption dynamics to workers comp. I'm not sure there are any two states that are the same so it's a variety across states. And secondly we're working with our trade to come together as a group to try to figure out responsible answers as we step forward in this crisis. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks, a couple of questions. One big one, Doug in your prepared remarks you mentioned that there is some I guess misinformed commentary, I was hoping you could talk about what commentary you are seeing out there that doesn't match your perception? Douglas Elliot : I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment Meyer about specifics. We treat each and every claim on its own merits or look at all the claims as they come in. We've been responsive, we're working through all the variety of lines and coverages, etc so, I think our claim group has done an outstanding job that just frustrates me at times when I feel like sometimes the press looks at us and doesn't give us the credit that I believe we deserve for what we do and how we support the marketplace. Meyer Shields : Okay, understood. The second question, can you give us some insight in terms of changes to commercial auto claim frequency that you've seen over the last six weeks or so? Douglas Elliot : We have. I will say this, our claim counts have been down both across personal and commercial. When it was clear by the end of March that they were down for that two week period and expected to continue into the second quarter, Beth and I and Stephanie Bush our entire group sat and worked through and ended up with the 15% refund for April and May that approximates $50 million plus or minus in money going back to customers. And in commercial we've also seen to a lesser degree but we've also seen fewer claim notices. We will watch that carefully, we're discussing and debating our commercial book as we speak, and as we come to any conclusions we will certainly share with you and all other parties. Meyer Shields : Okay, fair enough, and thank you for all the clarification this morning. Christopher J. Swift: Thanks Meyer. Operator : Thank you and the next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore. David Motemaden : Hi, thank you. Good morning. Just a question for Chris and Doug, I guess just wanted to dig in a little bit just thinking about the potential reserves that you may need to take heading into next quarter, is there any way you can help size the limit at risk in Navigators for the policies that don't require the property damage from the virus? And then in your 10-Q it sounds like you do expect to get reinsurance coverage on the occurrence treaties but it sounds like you expect limited recoveries given your current estimates of losses, should I take that to mean that you expect the losses in 2Q to be under $150 million? Christopher J. Swift: David thanks for joining us. I think what you're reading and interpreting in the Q is really off base, just fundamentally off base. I think how we've always prepared our Qs is. I mean we try to describe risk factors, we try to describe conditions so that there is a level of clarity. You should not read anything in the Q as predicting a loss, an attachment point, a session that we expect at this point in time. I think all we were pointing out though is like any property loss we do have certain levels of reinsurance on an aggregate and per risk basis but do not interpret that as a loss limit or as trying to signal anything, that's just good disclosure.Second, call it the Navigators piece Doug, again we're not going to get into the specifics but all I would say again handful of policies. There's aggregate limits in all of them for BI. We knew it said -- we knew about the program, it's a program geared towards the entertainment industry and once we come up with a final estimates we will tell you when we book them in the second quarter. Douglas Elliot : I would just add to that Chris, when I think about the Navigator property book it is very insignificant compared to the size of our overall property book, so less than one half of 1% relative to policy count. And their book is both primary and excess and their primary book generally they do not have virus exclusions. But across our entire property base, again I go back to the vast majority of our policies have the virus exclusion and we will work through those claims during the course of the second and third quarters and come to our estimates as we close out next quarter. Beth Costello : Yeah, the only thing that I'll add to the first part of the question and I agree with Chris's comments as it relates to things that we commented on in our risk factors, I think you may have been asking specifically about our property catastrophe treaty. And we did specifically say that pandemic is not excluded from that treaty and obviously given the level of losses that would have to be in order for us to hit that, we see that as very unlikely. So I think that that was the specific disclosure that you were may have been referring to. David Motemaden : Yes, that's right. Beth, thank you for clarifying. I appreciate that. And then I appreciate the response of everyone and I just wanted to also follow up just on putting the new money yields into cash or new money into cash. I guess how long do you expect this to continue and what are you specifically looking for, what do you need to see to start deploying that back into appropriate duration bonds? Christopher J. Swift: David thanks. I would just say or give you the context of what we did and why. It really is just a classic crisis playbook, right. I mean you have to admit we're in the midst of a crisis and when we started looking at things late February or early March so our spreads were going in the markets. Just game theory, other conditions we wanted is much liquidity and flexibility as possible. So we decided and took the action to not reinvest principal and interest coming off the portfolio into the new credit exposures at that time because you saw, the Fed didn't act until at least two to three weeks later and it was just a defensive cautionary position. And I think what I really want to do is tell you what we did, why, and the potential impacts on our run rate yield or NII from managing your expectations Beth. But that's what I would say. Beth Costello : Yeah, I think that's a good summary and again I think if you go back and look over what's happened over the last couple of months as Chris said, when we looked at this beginning of March it was really more reaction of the fact that we saw markets and specifically credit markets were feeling stress and we didn't want to be investing into that. As we go through March and then we get towards the end March into April we have more shelter in place orders and so forth and some of the actions that we're taking to provide relief to our customers. And the receipt of premium payments cause us to continue to want to build liquidity and so our view is as we go through the second quarter and we start to see some stability in what we're seeing relative to top line and those receipts we look to start then reinvesting again. But I really characterize this as moving from creating a position of strength rather than any sign of weakness as it relates to our overall balance sheet. David Motemaden : Okay, thanks for the clarification, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hey guys, good morning. My first question, I was hoping within your workers comp you can break down of the exposure to healthcare and other front line workers and then maybe more on peripheral industries like supermarkets, etc, and just give us a sense of the areas and the exposure within your book that you most likely to see losses within that line from COVID? Christopher J. Swift: Elyse, I think the only detail I'm comfortable sharing with you is for our small commercial and middle market book how you would define healthcare or how we would define healthcare which excludes dentist and optometrist that we would ensure. Our healthcare exposure to those on the frontline basis is less than 5% of our premium. But that's the only data point I'd like to give you at this point in time and I am not going to break down our entire book of business for you and give all our competitors opportunities to cherry pick it. So again very little minor frontline healthcare worker exposure in our book of business. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that's helpful and then my second question in terms of Navigators, a couple of questions, can you comment on what accident years development that was ceded to the agency came from in the quarter? And then second question related to Navigators, can you just comment on how the margin was in Q1 relative to the 5 to 6 points of improvement that you guys have laid out that you had expected for 2020? Christopher J. Swift: I am just waiting for the team to respond. Beth Costello : Yeah so on the Navigator's piece, we really are looking at 2018 and prior and I can't remember the exact year that was involved but it's in that bucket obviously that's covered by the ADC. Christopher J. Swift: At least as far as the improvement, I will look to Doug to add his color too but I'm pleased with the trajectory, the improvements. Again we talked about that 5 to 6 points of combined ratio improvement and I'm extremely confident we will achieve that in the timeframes that we've talked about. But Doug I thought we had good progress. Douglas Elliot : We did. So if you look at our numbers into the first quarter and compare them to a more normalized run rate which Beth and I keep looking back at, I would say the improvement is in the 3.5 range, 3.5 towards 4 what we see into 2020. I would also say to you that I'm very encouraged by our pricing progress and some of our book management programs as well. So as we work our way through 2020 into 2021 I feel like those goals are certainly attainable and I feel like we've made really good strides down that path Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, and then one last question, I know you guys and others in the industry have mentioned by right the desire right not to have but you have to change it to policy language, we've also heard a lot of chatter about potential prospective plan government backstop to provide pandemic coverage on a go forward basis. Do you have any thoughts there and I guess do you think that that's in terms of a time frame, is that something, I know there's a lot? Christopher J. Swift: Yeah Elyse as I alluded to in my prepared comments, we are working with our trade group and across the industry to develop if we can a consensus view on options and solutions for the future. So I think it's premature to comment upon anything right now other than the desire to contribute to a solution going forward from the industry perspective. And I think I've talked quite a bit of my peers in the industry and there is a desire to at least think creatively and come up with options and potential solutions. Beth Costello : And then Elyse just to follow up I was able to find the accident years, it is 17 and 18 is related to those marine losses. Operator : Thank you and the next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning, thanks. First question, I know we've talked about workers comp a lot already maybe dig in a little bit more, if you can elaborate on your comments regarding the potential for elevated claims in that line, maybe any fraud comments on how this recession could maybe play out differently than the last. I know there was one commercial carrier which said last week that maybe change the reserving cost a little bit and they released less reserves to be a little more conservative, if they can do accounts, that's the last recession kind of surprised them a little bit on the back end, which I believe may have also kind of happened to industry wide and to Hartford as well? Thanks. Douglas Elliot : Mike, good morning. Let me start with a few comments to frame this. I'd start by saying that, our accounts are down. But as you know, we are also working day by day on exposure changes with our policyholders. So until we get that exposure base where it needs to be, it's very difficult to predict frequency. But I expect over the short-term we'll see improvements and claim counts. If nothing else, we understand across our manufacturing book we'll see more experienced workers as people thinned their ranks. What we will tend to see would be more experienced workers on those lines. And as such, they will get injured less frequently. We're watching careful medical severity. We think there will be a little bit of pressure on duration. And also medical severity is an awful lot of medical attention this country right now dealing with COVID-19 and as such, we're slightly concerned that maybe all the people that need medical attention for other job related injuries are stacking up in the queue. So there are assortment of things relative to workers compensation we're keeping our eye on, some good and some pressure points to watch, even putting the presumption discussion to the side. Christopher J. Swift: Mike, I would just give you a larger picture perspective in that. I mean, if you're looking back to the Great Recession or other recessions that the U.S. economy has experienced, it is true that obviously unemployment and GDP is going to shrink. But one of those other recessions were caused by structural issues, whether it be credit overextended or imbalances in the economy. Remember, this was a shock to our to our U.S. economy. And the real hope and belief, at least I have, is with the great advances in the medical community and in some of the things that everyone's talking about and working on, we can remove the shock factor and go back to a structurally sound, consumer orientated economy that isn't stretched financially. It isn't out of balance in any way, shape or form. So -- but it's true, that might take some time to get the medical advancements necessary to relieve the shock that the economy is experiencing. Mike Zaremski : Great, that's helpful. My last question is regarding more broadly commercial pricing. Do you feel -- have you been seeing kind of pricing industry wide continue to move lot higher given the kind of uncertainty surrounding a lot of issues or our top line contraction is causing more broadly kind of pricing to move downwards a bit. And I'm speaking specifically to commercial pricing. But if you have the views on also personal lines pricing, given that seems to be a good area to be at, I'd be open to those as well? Thank you. Douglas Elliot : Tackle commercial first. I would suggest that the early look at April, April is not complete yet, it will be tonight. But the early look suggests consistency with what we saw in March. So the early part of the second quarter, I think, will exhibit similar patterns to what finished quarter one. And we'll obviously continue to watch this and manage this on a month to month basis as we move into quarter two. Personal lines, I think there are a lot of things going on in personal lines, including the fact that there's a fair amount of customer premium refunding going on in Q2 and a lot happening based on miles driven, but also now the potential turn on, turn back on of the economy. And one of the things we've debated amongst ourselves is, I think we expect to see potentially a bounce back in miles driven over the course of the summer. As people return to more normal living conditions we expect miles driven to go up as a result. Maybe fewer airline miles traveled, but more within their car. So those are all thoughts over the ensuing three to four months. But at the moment, yes, miles are down and we expect that to change. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great. Thank you so much and we all hope you're right about return to normalcy in the coming months. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. I had a question for Doug and a group benefits question, which I guess might also be for Doug. But I just recovered the property tax stuff on reinsurance, could you give us some indication of how some of the per risk reinsurance of the quota share or where might not respond to any potential COVID losses? Douglas Elliot : Well, you're right we do have per risk insurance inside our core property book. And obviously that would be on a risk by risk basis so it would depend on severity of risk. And those plans are in place and there are no virus exclusions attached to those programs. So that stands as is. There are also an assortment of other programs, including Navigators has a quota share program across their property book, heavily reinsured. So it almost needs a specific circumstance of the loss, Ryan to figure out how it applies. But number one, I would say I believe we've got sound underwriting on our primary book. And number two, I think we've got a well thought out reinsurance program that will respond if indeed it's called to. Ryan Tunis : And the other thing I wanted to hit on I guess was in group benefits. It seems like the short term disability kind of dwarfs the impact of worker's comp, even though that's what everyone's been talking about. Is it safe to think that if conditions remain like this, that 60 million for half a month would have that type of proportional impact I guess in ensuing quarters? Christopher J. Swift: Ryan, it's Chris. I would say no, I would not do that and I will tell you why. If you sort of break down what we though 10 million was for paid family leave, 6 million was for STD. I would say when we booked and made our estimates for the quarter, we had a claim count estimate, a duration estimate, and then it's simple math from there. The claim count that actually emerged and again, New York paid family leave primarily is our risk product there. It is just significantly down from what we expected. So it's not to say it can't come back, it's not to say it couldn't spike as people look at all the benefits that are available to them, but that claim count projection was off by a factor of at least 50%. And STD, I would share with you the view that we had, again, is changed a little bit as we got into April and the impact that we booked was for increased COVID-19 STDs.And to remind you, there is usually a seven day elimination period. And again, then if someone goes on STD because of COVID-19, generally what we're seeing is a 10 day to two week benefit. But there again the data that emerged in April is that, yeah, the COVID-19 claims are up, but everything else is down quite substantially. So the normal STD claims are the planned absence, STD claims. Everyone is sort of delaying normal activities as it could be related to STD coverages. So net-net the total claim projection or claims of how they're emerging in April is basically flat to slightly down with historical trends. Now that two could reverse but as it reverses, I think we would have less COVID-19 claims going forward. So I would not project it on a runway basis and we'll give you transparency into what we do in the second quarter. But at least right now there's offsetting factors that should mitigate losses. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And I guess the one follow-up I had is kind of a mechanical one, probably for Doug as well. Actually these comp studies we're seeing where -- whether it is the NCCI where you are coming up with a gross worker's comp loss estimate. What are some of the things we should be thinking about in terms of how deductible -- in reality, how that makes its way through a lawsuit in the insurance company, like the impact that a company deductible might have to mitigate that or the fact that it might not even make it to worker's comp, right. I guess it could become a short term disability claim or maybe health insurance might cover it. I'm just trying to understand, like trying to net that down to those gross numbers, what are some things we should be thinking about? Douglas Elliot : Just a few comments. It is so hard to project here. But yes, the national account customer segment, Fortune 2000 plus many have some form of loss responsive program where there's is either a deductible attached, some kind of retention arrangement. So yes, that would not at all just flow directly into comp losses. In terms of Main Street America, much of middle market America, I think those contracts are largely guaranteed costs. So there's a risk transfer programs. And again, this is going to be a state by state dynamic. But I would think much of that content change would show up in the P&L of insurers over time. Then the last thought I have for you is that, the fundamental way we run this business is that we take historical losses and we run them through our actual role model and then we develop rates going forward based on all the risks we're taking. And I fully expect whether we're talking worker's comp or property as we come out of this COVID-19 experience, we'll be doing exactly that with those losses paid. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thank you and good morning everybody. Just Chris, is it simply that it was just too early, I'm just curious I guess the rationale for not putting out any kind of expected number, both on the P&C side for COVID losses written? Christopher J. Swift: Again, we reacted to what we know, what we saw. If you really think about it, it was two weeks of the month and really what I'd like you to take away from it is there isn't any big surprises out there that we don't see or understand. Meaning we're not in certain lines of business that people put up a lot of reserves. I mean, we're not in the event cancellation business, we don't have a material trade credit exposures or anything along those lines. We don't have a travel business. So we have our core products and our core capabilities and yeah, I mean, two weeks for -- the virus to sort of make any type of adjustment. And the accounting is I mean, we can't book second quarter events in the first quarter, right. I mean, it's got to be sort of a known and exposed to a first quarter event. So we'll see what develops here in the second quarter. But we're not sitting on anything big in my judgment. Michael Phillips : Okay, no, thanks. Appreciate that. And then I guess lastly, any thoughts you could share on expectations for earnings for the rest of the year for the top level? Douglas Elliot : Yeah, well let's get through the crisis and the immediate events here. I mean, we're not going to reproject or give new guidance at this point in time. Beth Costello : Which were you asking for. Michael Phillips : Guidance for the rest of the year. Beth Costello : Talcott he said. Excuse me. Operator : So, yeah so that's hard to predict. Obviously, as we said we record Talcott earnings on a quarter lag. So we typically get their financial statements 45-50 days after quarter. And I'd expect that given their -- the hedging profile of that entity, that we're likely to see gains from the first quarter. And I'd point you to look at first quarter of 2019 when they recorded the impact of the fourth quarter of 2018 and the impact of hedging gains that we saw there. And then as far as predicting dividends, I mean, that gets difficult to do. We were pleased to get a dividend last year and we know that their plan is to continue to pay dividends. But, until we get the cash in the door, we don't count it. It is not included in any of our holding company projections of cash flows. Michael Phillips : Okay, thank you guys. Appreciate it guys. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes the question-and-answer session. So I would like to turn the floor to Susan Spivak for any closing comments. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you. We appreciate all of you joining us this morning. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any follow up questions. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Thank you for joining us today. I trust you and your families remain safe and healthy during this pandemic. Our hearts go out to those grieving, ill, or confronting economic hardships. I may begin my remarks with some overarching comments. When we last spoke at the end of April, we were just weeks into the wave of stay-at-home orders that would eventually affect most of the country and much of the globe and the market was only beginning to develop a sense of how sweeping the consequences of COVID-19 would be. At that time, there was considerable certainty as to the scope, duration, and economic impact of the global health crisis. Now, as we enter the second half of 2020, I am encouraged by the progress the country has made in a number of areas, although tremendous challenges and a host of unknowns persist. I want to thank our employees across the United States and around the world, as well as our many partners for their extraordinary dedication during this unprecedented times as we have navigated this crisis together. Throughout this crisis, The Hartford has remained focused on serving customers, working closely with distribution partners, and taking appropriate steps to safeguard the health and safety of our talented team. At the same time, we have continued to execute on our original 2020 strategies, including realizing the full potential of our product capabilities and underwriting expertise, becoming an easier company do business with, attracting and retaining the talent we need for long-term success. In support of these strategic goals, we have launched a new transformational program focused on elevating customer needs, simplifying business routines, further leveraging remote work, and achieving expense savings of approximately $500 million in 2022, as measured off our 2019 expense base. While the initial work on this program predates the pandemic, it is all the more applicable and responsive to the current environment. I am excited about the impact of this initiative, which we refer to as Hartford Next, as it represents the next step in our focus to increase competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies, while continuing to provide outstanding service to our agents and customers. Beth will provide additional financial details in her commentary. Now, let me turn to our results for the quarter. Despite the many challenges we faced, we delivered strong underlying performance with core earnings of $438 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, 3.5% growth in book value per share excluding AOCI from year end 2019 and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 12.7%. These results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our businesses. In Property and Casualty, our broader product offerings and expanded distribution are providing more opportunities to leverage positive pricing momentum in the areas of the market that are hardening. Group benefits results reflect continued favorable incidents trends in solid sales. The quarter was impacted by a number of unusual items, including incurred losses related to COVID-19 of $251 million, which is based on an exhaustive review of all applicable policies. $213 million of the incurred loss is attributed to our Property and Casualty business and $38 million to group benefits. On the P&C side, COVID-19 incurred losses primarily relate to property, workers' compensation, and financial lines. Of the $213 million attributed to P&C, $101 million relate to reserves for a small number of property policies, in particular, within our middle and large commercial and global specialty businesses, there are a handful of unique policies which were intended to provide a broader range of coverage for specific business needs, such as crisis management or performance disruption. In addition, we have a small number of highly manuscript policies that do not contain a physical damage requirement. We believe the reserves established appropriately cover claims arising out of our property portfolio. Put this small group of policies into context, well, nearly all of our property policies include coverage for business interruption, 99% of them contain a clear requirement that a direct physical loss or damage to property must occur to trigger coverage. In addition to this requirement, 99% of our property policies with BI coverage also contain standard exclusions that we believe preclude coverage for COVID-19 related claims. And finally, we also have a specific virus exclusion on the vast majority of these policies. As I've said many times before, responding to customer claims and doing it well is at the heart of who we are. We are in the business of paying covered claims and that's exactly what we're doing. Unfortunately, when it comes to business interruption claims resulting from this pandemic, we believe it is self-evident that COVID-19 does not cause direct physical loss or damage to property, and that the various stay-at-home orders were issued to reduce community spread, not to prevent property damage. As a result, COVID-19 related claims are outside the scope of our policy terms and conditions and simply are not covered. We are highly confident in our contract language in coverage positions and have put up $40 million in reserves to cover the estimated legal costs of defending our business interruption policy language. Excluding the unusual items in the quarter, commercial lines underlying results continue to benefit from underwriting actions to improve profitability and drive efficiencies, along with accelerating premium momentum, and what can be characterized as a hardest market in decades. At the beginning of 2020, I shared my outlook for the pricing cycle, anticipating 18 to 24-month period of significant rate increases. Now, through the first six months of the year, I have even more conviction that the hardening market in many commercial lines is sustainable with ongoing price momentum, despite the challenging economic conditions of a slowing economy. Our core P&C underwriting platform expanded through the Navigators acquisition is benefiting from higher prices and middle market and global specialty, with the exception of workers' comp. Global specialty results reflect improving risk adjusted returns in the business acquired, driven by underwriting actions taken as we integrated the business and robust renewal rate increases. With the significant pricing momentum in these lines, we are on track to meet or exceed our targeted earnings and margin goals. While the largest rate increases are in lines within our global specialty segment, renewal pricing in our standard commercial lines, also continues to be strong. Doug will provide additional detail in his commentary. Turning to group benefits, I am pleased with the operational execution and financial performance of the business reflecting our strong underwriting and risk management discipline. Group benefits posted solid results for the quarter with core earnings of $102 million and a 6.9% margin. Earnings were down versus prior year due to $38 million before tax of COVID-19 related losses as previously mentioned, a $14 million before tax increase in the allowance for uncollectible premium, and lower net investment income, partially offset by excellent disability results. The disability loss ratio was 62.6%, improved 10.3 points versus prior year, driven by higher recoveries in continued favorable incident trends. We also updated our year-to-date COVID-19 short-term disability assumptions, resulting in a favorable adjustment of $5 million pretax. The life loss ratio was 85.9% increasing 8.1 points from the second quarter of 2019, driven by COVID related losses of $43 million. On the topline, persistency remains solid at approximately 90% and new fully insured sales were $149 million, up from prior year, driven by national accounts. With the recent spikes in COVID-19 across the country, states are continuing to evaluate their respective policies pertaining to social gatherings and stay-at-home orders. These impacts could continue to affect revenue and results in the quarters ahead. As a market leader, our group benefits business is well-positioned operationally to respond to the challenges of the pandemic and the economic recession while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. Let me now close with a few comments about three public policy issues important to the economy and our industry. First, as states reopen and we reignite the nation's economy; millions of Americans will need to safely transition back to work and back to the office. We must ensure that obstacles to this critical transition are appropriately addressed. Be specific, I believe federal legislation creating a timely, targeted, and temporary Safe Harbor against frivolous lawsuits related to COVID-19 is critical to providing businesses of all sizes the confidence they need to reopen. Second, much debate has occurred around workers' compensation presumptions. While we value and appreciate the services and sacrifices of essential workers, it's important to note that the current workers' compensation system has been an American success story for over 100 years. We accept the decision by some states to impose a limited presumption for those who come into close contact with those suffering from the COVID-19 virus in the course of providing them medical aid and treatment. But we are troubled by efforts to alter well-established principles of the current system. The significant cost of expansive presumptions will ultimately be borne by the municipalities and businesses at a time when they are all struggling to recover. In addition, any measures that impede the ability of insurers to appropriately account for an increase in the cost of claims in future rates would represent an unfair tax on the industry. Third, and finally, the devastation caused by this pandemic is unlike anything we've experienced before. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have seen governments at all levels take extraordinary action to contain the virus, protect lives, and safeguard the economy. These events in the magnitude of the interventions have made it clear that pandemics and other widespread viral outbreaks are fundamentally uninsurable. That said, we understand the insurance industry has unique knowledge, expertise, and capabilities that can and should be brought to bear to help develop solutions to address future pandemics. We believe a federal response is critical, both from a coordination and funding perspective. In short, a robust public sector based solution is necessary and we are working closely with our industry trade association and the agent and broker community to support the recently released Business Continuity Protection Program or BCPP. This program would provide immediate relief to businesses in the form of revenue replacement assistance for payroll and employee benefits in other operating expenses in the event of a future pandemic. Any federal solution designed to protect against future pandemics should provide timely, effective, and affordable relief to businesses across the country. I believe the BCPP provides such a solution. To recap, The Hartford second quarter results demonstrate solid execution as we adopted -- adapted to the next normal. Despite the challenges of COVID-19 and the resulting uncertainty of the future, we remain focused on investing in the business for growth and efficiencies, while producing top quartile returns on equity for shareholders. I remain confident our company will manage through the crisis and emerge well-positioned to continue to achieve our strategic goals. Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Elliot : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I can't agree more that the challenges are unprecedented and certainly contributed to many other financial impacts in the quarter. Overall, Property and Casualty core earnings were $309 million and written premium was flat to prior year at $2.9 billion. The underlying combined ratio of 97.6% was quite good, considering COVID charges of $243 million. COVID charges consists of underwriting losses of $213 million or 7.5 points and a $30 million increase or 1.1 points in the allowance for credit losses on premiums receivable. I also continue to be pleased with the strong pricing in our non-workers' compensation commercial lines. Before I get into the segment details, let me summarize the actions we took this quarter with respect to COVID-19, cats, and prior year reserve development. Recognizing the economic impact of the pandemic on our customers during the quarter, we responded with several actions, three of which I'll highlight. First, we endorsed nearly 250,000 policies to adjust for changes in risk, returning over $35 million in premium to our commercial customers since the middle of March, reflecting lower payroll and other exposures. In a related action, we also reduced expected audit premium, leading to $100 million reduction in our audit premium receivable. When netted with losses and commissions, this led to a $34 million reduction in underwriting results. Second, we delivered personal auto refunds of $81 million or 15% of the second quarter premium, reflecting favorable frequency trends in the quarter. And third, we extended billing grace periods through May 31 on all policies, while waiving late fees that would otherwise apply. The extension drove second quarter personal lines and small commercial policy count retention, four to five points higher than the historical run rate, and increased Property and Casualty allowance for credit losses on premiums receivable by $30 million or 1.1 points. In commercial lines, COVID underwriting losses, the majority of which relate to IBNR reserves were $213 million for the quarter or 9.9 points. Property losses were $141 million, including a $40 million provision to defend the company in litigation, challenging certain business interruption denials. Gross workers' compensation losses were $75 million, including a provision for those states that enacted presumptive legislation. Offsetting the gross loss was COVID related favorable frequency in the quarter of $40 million, driving a net impact of $35 million. Financial lines and other losses were $37 million, primarily for D&O, E&O and surety claims. Turning to catastrophes, Property and Casualty recorded losses of $248 million, including $110 million for civil unrest. The remaining losses for wind and hail storms were less severe than a typical second quarter. Net favorable prior year development for the quarter was $268 million and contained a number of reserve actions including $400 million of favorable catastrophe reserve development, driven primarily by a reduction in net loss estimates for the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires, which included a $289 million subrogation benefit from PG&E. Continued favorable development in personal lines auto and workers' compensation. Bond reserves development was also favorable in the quarter, while we strengthen commercial auto. Reserves strengthening of $102 million for sexual molestation and abuse claims. And finally, net unfavorable ex-cat reserved development of $49 million on Navigator reserves, primarily in the Lloyd's syndicate D&O and domestic general liability lines. $54 million of the total development was from accident years 2018 and prior and therefore, economically covered by the adverse development cover. Turning now to our business line results, the commercial lines underlying combined ratio was $102.9, increasing 9.7 points over prior year, including 11.1 points for COVID charges. The remaining variance was primarily due to a lower expense ratio from reduced travel and incentive compensation costs and some modest early wins from our transformation program and improved in marine [ph] losses from a year ago. As a pivot to pricing, the industry continues to achieve much needed pricing gains as another positive quarter contributes to a strong six months. This is particularly evident in auto, specialty, and excess casualty lines. For the quarter, renewal written pricing and standard commercial lines was 3.6%, down 70 basis points from quarter one. However, excluding workers' compensation, which was negative 1.3%, pricing was up 7.8% slightly ahead of our strong first quarter. These results continue to demonstrate our ability to achieve rate increases across each of our non-workers' compensation commercial lines. I would remind you that the 7.8% is standard lines only. Adding core global specialty lines would move this pricing measure higher. In middle market, renewal written pricing in the U.S. excluding workers' compensation increased 9.3%, down slightly from the first quarter, but still a very strong result and 520 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019. Property and general liability pricing are each in the high single-digits and auto is now in the low teens. I'm also pleased with the continued pricing momentum and reshaping in global specially. Strong pricing gains continue in both our U.S. wholesale book as well as the international portfolio, which is primarily written in Lloyds. The U.S. wholesale book achieved 24 points of rate in the second quarter, nearly five points better than quarter one. Auto and property lines are strong in the high teens, while excess casually eclipsed 30% in the second quarter, up over nine points from quarter one. U.S. financial lines also at a particularly strong quarter achieving pricing is 17%, more than doubling the first quarter results. Pricing gains in the international portfolio continue their upward trend with very strong results in professional lines, energy, and cargo Let me share a few more details on our commercial businesses beginning with small commercial, which posted an underlying combined ratio of 92.9%, 5.1 points higher than the second quarter of 2019, including 5.8 points from COVID charges. Small commercial written premium was down 9% versus prior year, driven by several factors. New business declined 24%, excluding the 2019 for most renewal rights transaction. Topline was also impacted by a reduction in audit premiums and negative exposure endorsements, partially offset by strong retention. With that said, I'm encouraged with our spectrum new business flow in June and July. July quotes are up 6% and new business is expected to exceed 2019 ex for most [ph]. Middle and large commercial reported and underlying combined ratio of 12.9 in the second quarter, an increase of 12 points over the prior year period including 16 points from COVID charges. A favorable expense ratio and lower inland marine losses contributed to the ex-COVID improvement. Written premium declined 10% in the quarter, largely driven by lower new business and expected declines in retention due to our underwriting and strong pricing actions. Our re-underwriting is intended to improve profitability levels in portions of our book. To that end, I am confident the underlying business is improving as expected. The decline in new business within middle and large commercial, however, is larger than I expected, causing us to look hard at those levels across lines, classes, and geographies. I sense we're not alone in experiencing compressed new business levels during the COVID crisis. I also see increasingly competitive workers' compensation marketplace. However, there is sequential progress with new business from an April low through our current view of July. Moving to global specially, the underlying my ratio was 105.5%, increasing 14.8 points from the second quarter of 2019, including 13.4 points from COVID charges. We continue to be pleased with the Navigators acquisition. The acquired diversification of product offerings has put us in a much better position to take full advantage of this hard market. Additionally, considerable portfolio reshaping continues, including shifting industry and geographic mix, raising attachment points and reducing policy limits. Combining these actions with our sustained pricing work, I'm pleased with the improving risk adjusted returns of global specialty. The early returns are positive. Year-to-date, the underlying combined ratio for global specialty was 101%, including 6.8 points for COVID charges. Considering the impact of the COVID charges and that the underlying combined ratio for global specialty was 98.5% in the second half of 2019, we've seen significant improvement almost entirely coming from the Navigators book. Shifting over to personal lines; let me first say how pleased we were to announce a 10-year renewal with AARP [ph] in May. We also had strong underwriting results in the quarter. We do, however, appreciate that the shelter-in-place guidelines resulting from the COVID environment favorably impacted the strong performance and led to the aforementioned auto premium refund of $81 million. The underlying combined ratio of 80.7% improved 10.3 points from a year ago. In personalized auto, the underlying combined ratio of 86.3% was 10.4 points better than 2019. Frequency was down significantly during the first two months of the quarter, and increasingly less favorable during June as the number of drivers and the corresponding miles driven increased with the lifting of shelter-in-place orders. Claim severity was consistent with what we expected in the quarter. In homeowners, the underlying combined ratio of 70.1% was 9.1 points better than prior year, driven predominantly by a favorable non-cat weather in the quarter. We've had a strong six months of non-cat loss performance in our homeowners book. Let me now step back from our business results and reflect on what we might expect for the second half of the year. As we've seen predicting the course of this pandemic and its economic impact can be incredibly difficult. The status of state reopening plans are constantly changing, as new virus hotspots appear across the country. Within small commercial and middle and large commercial, third quarter total written premium could be down moderately versus prior year. I expect renewal pricing for specially and non-workers' compensation lines will remain strong and mitigate lower new business levels. While there have been encouraging signs in June and July with respect to new business, endorsements, and premium cash collections, the actual results for the quarter will also depend upon the success of gradual reopening and macro-economic conditions. In closing, the second quarter has certainly been extraordinary. Yet as I look through the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, the foundation is solid and diversified. The work we have done over the past five years with our insurance and risk management platform will drive new business growth and strong underwriting results. And our talent is poised to be responsive yet thoughtful to capitalize on risk opportunities in a dynamic market. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Doug. Before I review the results for investments, Hartford funds, and corporate, I would like to take a moment and discuss further our process for establishing loss reserves. Our objective is always to establish appropriate loss reserves to cover the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred to-date. We rely upon multiple actuarial techniques to formulate our views, considering estimates for both reported claims and those incurred but not yet reported. Typically, these techniques project reserve estimates by looking at historical patterns and trends and establishing a view of how claims will develop over time. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event. Given the lack of historical claim data on which to base loss reserve estimates, there's a higher degree of uncertainty in developing reserves associated with COVID-19. We took this into account in determining our loss reserve estimates for the quarter. For example, IBNR reserves represent over 80% of our estimate, which is higher than usual as we expect for extended claim reporting patterns, given the economic disruption created by the pandemic. Additionally, D&O, E&O and employment practices liability policies are written on a claims made basis and our loss reserve estimate is based on claims reported or noticed through June 30th. In the quarter, we also increased our allowance for credit losses on premiums receivable by $44 million before tax, including $30 million in P&C, and $14 million in group benefits, reflecting a higher amount of aged receivables and the effect of the economic strain on expected collection of premiums. Now, turning to investments. Net investment income was $339 million for the quarter, down $149 million from the second quarter of 2019, primarily driven by a loss on limited partnerships. As a reminder, results for LPs and other alternative investments are reported on a quarter lag. So, the second quarter loss reflects the decline and underlying fund valuations in the first quarter. While equity markets have improved, we are expecting LP results to be better, but still at a loss in the third quarter. This reflects the deterioration in business fundamentals during the second quarter, a more muted recovery in valuation multiples given continued economic uncertainty, and relatively low public equity market exposure and the underlying funds. The current investment yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.4%, down from 3.8% a year earlier and up from 3.3% in the first quarter. We expect the before tax investment yield excluding LPs over the remainder of 2020 to be about 20 basis points lower than the 3.4% earned in the second quarter. The portfolio yield has been impacted by lower reinvestment rates and lower short-term rates. Our yields have also been impacted by our efforts to increase liquidity. Last quarter, I mentioned that we were carrying more liquid assets in our normal benchmarks and that continues in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with almost 7% of our investments in liquid assets. Given improved use for operating cash flows, we would expect to reduce that to roughly 5.5% in the third quarter. The net unrealized gain position of $2 billion after-tax on fixed maturities increased by $371 million from year end, driven by a decline in interest rates, partially offset by wider credit spreads. Unrealized and realized gains on equity securities, which are recorded within net realized capital gains in the income statement, were $75 million before tax in the quarter, reflecting an increase in valuations due to higher equity market levels. During the quarter, we recorded credit losses of $42 million pretax on our investment portfolio, consisting of a $20 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturities available for sale and a $22 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio based on revised economic forecasts and updated property values. Our fixed maturity investment portfolio is broadly diversified and high quality with an overall average credit rating of A plus. 96% of the portfolio is investment-grade with nearly three quarters of that rated A or better. Turning to Hartford funds, core earnings of $33 million were down 13% from second quarter of 2019, resulting from a decrease in fee income, driven primarily by lower average daily AUM, partially offset by lower variable operating expenses. Harford funds assets under management were up 15% compared to the first quarter, however, they were still down 3% year-over-year. Net outflows were $675 million in the quarter compared with net outflows of $105 million in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting the movement in funds driven by the economic effects of COVID-19. The corporate core loss of $6 million in the quarter compared to a core loss of $35 million in the second quarter of 2019. The retained equity interest in [Indiscernible] which is reported on a one quarter lag was the biggest driver and contributed income of $68 million before tax, compared with $3 million of income in second quarter 2019. The increased income from the [Indiscernible] investment largely reflects the result of [Indiscernible] hedging program. Given how equity markets increased during the second quarter, we would expect to give back about a third of that gain in our third quarter reporting. Moving on to capital management, as you know, we paused our share repurchase activity in March. We have not resumed share repurchases and we'll continue to monitor the economic and other impacts of COVID-19. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $45.25 cents, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.9% and an increase of 3.5% from the year end 2019. The 12-month core earnings ROE was 12.7%. As Chris indicated, we have initiated a program to improve our overall efficiency which will achieve annual operating expense savings of approximately $500 million in 2022 and contribute to our goal of reducing our P&C expense ratio by two to two and a half points, our group benefits expense ratio by 1.5 to two points, and our claim expense ratio by half a point. To achieve these savings, we expect to spend approximately $360 million with $320million expense through 2022, of which $130 million will be classified as restructuring costs and will not be included in core earnings. We have included a summary table in the earnings slides, which provides a more detailed breakout by year of the estimated expense reductions and related costs. In the coming quarters, we look forward to updating you on our progress. As we look to the second half of 2020, it is difficult to forecast the business climate going forward, given the recent rise in COVID-19 inflections in many states of the country and uncertainty surrounding the economic recovery. States that had relaxed restrictions on businesses and lessen stay-at-home guidelines are now putting restrictions back into place. As such, there is a range of scenarios in terms of impacts to our topline, particularly in commercial lines and the amount of COVID-19 losses we might expect to see in future periods. As Doug noted, written premiums could be down moderately. From a loss perspective, we will see additional COVID losses due to new incidents in areas like workers' compensation and group benefits. We will continue to monitor claims within financial lines related to the economic strain created by the pandemic. Additionally, we could see impacts to the frequency trends experience in affected lines. The magnitude of all these items will be impacted by how the virus progresses and the actions that are taken to reduce the impact of the virus and the effectiveness of the economic stimulus from the federal government. While there is uncertainty as to the full impact of the virus, The Hartford is well-positioned to weather this pandemic with strong underlying performance, as well as a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity as we continue to invest in our businesses and achieve our strategic objectives. I'll now turn the call over to Susan, so we can begin the Q&A session. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you, Beth. Andrew, we'll take the first question. Operator : Yes, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. I'm just a question for Doug. If I look at the accident year loss ratio ex-cat and commercial lines and I take out the COVID charges of roughly 10 points, I get to around a 58% accident year loss ratio ex-cat. That's better than it's been over the last few quarters since you close the Navigators deal of 59 to 60. So, I guess I'm just wondering what was driving that improvement and if there's any benefit from lower non-COVID attritional losses that's flowing through that? Douglas Elliot : David, on our casualty lines, we essentially did not move our pics in the quarter, the year is still very immature. We did share with you in our workers' comp COVID charts that we had a variable frequency that we did recognize. So, I'd asked you to make sure you've made that adjustment in your ex-cat numbers. But essentially, it was our ongoing loss trends. We still feel like the loss trends that we had talked to you about expected for 2020 are essentially right where we see them today ex-COVID. And so no, no material changes. David Motemaden : Okay, great. And then if I could just ask a question on the cost to program. And I guess, just if I think about the 2 to 2.5 points in P&C of expense ratio improvement, and 1.5 and 2 points in group benefits by 2022. Just wondering I guess, what is the view on top line levels within that expectation for the reduction or should I think about -- should I think about the, the potential for greater than 500 million of cost saves in order to get to, you know, the 2 to 2.5 in P&C and 1.5 to 2 points in group benefits by 2022? Christopher Swift : Yeah, David, it's Chris. Thank you for joining us in the question. Though, it's a combination, right, as we outlined, we are looking to extract $500 million of what we would consider fixed cost savings in 2022. But we're also cognizant of the fact that premium volumes may fluctuate up or down, from where we closed out in 2019, which is the measurement base. So, as we go through, I'll call it the next couple years, we'll have to make any appropriate adjustments, because at the end of the day, we want to get closer to all in expense ratio that is least in commercial as close to that 30% mark. And if premiums are greater, that means, we'll have a lower ratio in for the premiums are less we'll look to other fixed and other variables cost to take out to achieve our result. David Motemaden : Great. Thanks. So more anchored in terms of the expense ratio than the dollar amount of costs. That's helpful. Thanks for -- thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just me on the Hartford Next, I think, couple questions. And I think first of all, Chris, if you could just give us a little bit more perspective on the genesis of this. I guess, like, what's the long game here? Is it is it your longer term view is that you can offer more affordable policies? Or is this purely a driver to enhance your RV over time, that's, that's the first part. And then I mean, just along with that, $500 million is clearly quite a bit of costs, what are the offsets we should be thinking about? You know, when we think about what might ultimately fall to the bottom line in 2022? Thanks. Christopher Swift : Sure. But I think the genesis questions is, if you look back over the last five years, I mean, we've been investing in the platform, I think, you know, quite significantly and appropriately, whether it be in product, whether it be in underwriting, whether it be in IT platforms, digital, our data and analytics, capabilities, robotics, and how we could continue to just be more productive. So, I think it's just a culmination of those years of investing and stepping back and saying, we probably need to harvest more gains and then we have to date in rally you know, everyone and this is a company wide effort. Everyone's involved all businesses all shared services. And, you know, we want to we want to harvest the gains. I think our initial point of view right now is to drop the majority to the, the bottom line. But I do want to think about, growth, organic growth, particularly in what we might be able to do in either new areas or existing areas, or potentially, you know, to capture more share, but initial thinking right now is, is more, you know, dropping to the bottom line. And I would say the timing of all this was fortuitous. And at least in my judgment, we had a small team thinking about this in the fourth quarter, doing our benchmarking, and then really, you know, first and second quarters, I would say, Beth and Beth could add her color. And we develop the, the specific action plans, and I'm really, really detailed basis. So that we felt comfortable, obviously announcing it, you know, here today with the appropriate investments that are needed. And when I, when you look at the cost, think of in essence that the separation cost is separate. But there are also, investments that we're still going to make in our platform primarily in the technology side to bring out structural savings over the long term. So that's what I would share with you, Brian, and Beth, I don't know if you would add anything. Beth Costello : Yes. Thanks, Chris. The only thing I'd add, just to pick up on a comment that that Chris made is. We have been working on the efforts for planning for this over the course of the first and second quarter. So we have very detailed plans that we are tracking to that will achieve these benefits over the next couple of years. Well over you know, 600 individual initiatives, and as Chris said, is across all aspects of the business, but we really are now in execution mode. This is as if we're planning to determine how to reduce our costs, we have detailed plans, and we will be executing to them. And as I said, we'll update you on our progress as we go Christopher Swift : Off an running. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. A follow this is probably I am guessing for Beth, but the defense cost portion of the of the BI charge that you took, how do we think about that? Is that mostly -- is that your view of what this is ultimately going to cost you? Or you know, how, I guess how encompassing isn't it was $40 million or $50 million. How encompassing that charge? Thanks. Christopher Swift : Ryan. It's very encompassing. I mean, we were very thoughtful about it, you know, working in conjunction with our legal team, our general counsel, recognizing that this isn't going to go away overnight. I mean, this is going to be an extended period of time where there's going to be litigation disputes, and it's a multi-year view of what we think we are going to spend to vigorously defend our policy terms and conditions. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, no -- if I back out that 11.1 points, that's the commercial COVID impacts on some your underlying that's about 150 basis points of year-over-year improvement. So just tie together some of the earlier comments. It sounds like there was nothing kind of one-off, I guess, away from COVID in the quarter. So is that the right level of kind of underlying margin improvement we could think about for the balance of the year and, just, given kind of what you know, now? Christopher Swift : Elyse, it's just a couple of points to respond to that. First thing is, some of that variance was expense related. So we had a good quarter on the expense side. And you see that in our printed numbers. I'd also remind you that you know that's in addition to the allowance for doubtful account charge, we also took on the quarter sheet out -- you could adjust the quarterly number for what we gave you in terms of the $30 million bad debt change. Secondly, we did talk about inland marine losses being better in middle commercial in the quarter. So, there is some good news on the property side in metal. But essentially, yeah, I think you have it, well laid out. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks. And then my second question, we've been hearing some color about, how the workers' compensation market might be bottoming. Do you guys have some thoughts there? And as we think about, a timeframe on know when we kind of might get to flat and potentially we could start to see some positive rated artists? Douglas Elliot : Sure, let me start and if Chris and Beth want to add any color that would be great. We would agree that we think we're seeing some bottoming in the workers' comp pricing. That's a -- that's good news. And obviously, it matters deeply to our company. I would add that, if you just isolate factors, the one factor that will now be, joining all the new filings going forward is a very different yield curve assumption in all our filings. In fact, you know, if you look at the 10, year over the last 12 months, just go year-to-year, filing today versus 12 months ago, we're probably talking about 150 basis points plus or minus, and maybe up to three to five points have changed just on rate need alone for yield curve. So the yield curve will be one of the stimulants, and then as the experience works, its way through the process. We expect to see more recovery, but I think a flattening, and maybe a slightly upward trend is fair to look at that scenario. Chris? Christopher Swift : Yeah, I think it's -- well said Doug. I just looked at some aggregate numbers, maybe at various states, California, New York, we were approaching 100% combined ratio today. So the pressure is only going to get more intense, particularly as you said, as far as, you know, interest rates, although frequencies continue to behave in a very well, at least in our point of view, but I think it all points to, you could foreshadow four to six quarters out, that there really is a beginning of an inflection point. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And one last quick number question on the savings program on to the core expenses. So the charges that you laid out, those hit your segments over that six month through your corporate segment? Beth Costello : Yeah. So, the expenses that are considered core, those would run through the business segments really the restructuring costs, would run in the corporate segments. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. First, I had a question about just your expectations on claims trends in the disability business. There are concerns among investors that as the economy weakens claims will go up and wondering, are you see the interplay of the weaker economy versus sort of the work from home environment and net-net? Do you see disability margins potentially improving despite the weaker economy or do you expect them to get worse? Christopher Swift : Jimmy, it's clearly you know, watch area. As you know, historically, one, unemployment rises, disability claims tend to go up. I would tell you that, our data both on the short term and long term side does not show any pressure. But remember long term disability usually has 180 day elimination period. So it does take some time before you would see new incidences, then that could translate into two more claims over a longer period of time. So our insurance trends in 20 year continue to be, again at very low levels all time low levels, although there might be some modest hiccups in certain segments. So it's clearly, a watch item, but it's not emerging in our data yet. But as we make three year rate guarantees, particularly we're in the one 121 season right now, we're taking this all into consideration to provide ourselves an additional margin or additional buffer for potentially more incidences, and obviously a lower interest rate environment. Jimmy Bhullar : And on workers' comp, you mentioned pricing potentially increasing given sort of the uptake and the combined ratio industry wide, your margins in the business have been pretty good. If pricing does sort of stabilize to improve, do you think your margins could sustain where they are even potentially improve from recent levels, which have been really good? Douglas Elliot : Think that's a bit premature. And now you're out into a 2021, 2022 conversation, which we're not prepared to have right now. We've talked about the 2020 year, our small commercial book is experiencing some compression and workers' comp margins. That's, that's where we are relative to those prices being negative. So we will continue to update you, but I think it's a little premature to talk about improve margins and workers' comp today. Christopher Swift : I would add just again, my comments were geared more at accident year results not calendar year. So I'm not sure what your comment was geared at but mine were clearly accident airbase. Jimmy Bhullar : Yeah, that was -- it was near as well. And I was thinking more about next year then and the year beyond, and then 2022, as opposed to this year but. On LPs you had a loss, obviously, because of the lag effect of the weak equity market 1Q, I was assuming that in Q2 -- in Q3 given that the market had recovered, you would actually see gains, maybe not all of the losses reversed, but at least a lot of them. But I think that's implied that your marks will still be negative. Am I did, I hear that correctly? Beth Costello : Yes. You did hear that correctly, Jimmy, when we look at it, we don't expect it to be as large of a loss as we had in Q2. But, you know, again, the valuations are not just based on equity markets, some of them are also based on forward look of earnings and so forth. So again, given some of the items that I referenced, we would expect potentially to see still a little bit of a loss there as we go into Q3. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Hey, Great, thanks. Good morning. If we can talk about the workers' comp, presumption, issue and changes, are the presumption changes, largely only focusing on COVID-19. So, when this pandemic is hopefully over, it'll kind of be -- this will be behind us or are the presumption changes also -- kind of permanent regarding kind of any virus or sickness going forward. And so we should be thinking about this maybe a different claims rate in the future, even when the pandemics over. Douglas Elliot : Mike, let's parse that apart. I would say, in general, the presumption by state new guidelines are targeted at COVID. And most of them have sunset clauses on the backside. So we are paying a lot of attention to the particular state by state. I think as of June 30, there were 14 states, and several of them were very important big states for us. So think about it in the context of COVID and we're working with trades and our teams here to make sure we understand all the nuances. And it's an ongoing matter because there are certainly ongoing discussions in various states today that continue to be important as we think about our workers' compensation line. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And lastly, thanks for the disclosure and the 10-Q on business interruption. I think you kind of talked to more than 150 cases. It seems like based on the data out there that Hartford is -- has kind of involved in a somewhat disproportionate number of businesses interruption cases versus the overall pool. Is there anything we -- any reason why that's the case or anything we should be thinking about? We clearly had good color on the IBNR levels and whatnot. But it seems like there's just lawyers poking at you guys a little bit more than others? Douglas Elliot : Yeah, Mike, I think I've seen your report on that. I don't know if I agree with it completely. Just given how I think things you might have been counting, but I'm not going to comment upon any specific litigation. But I wouldn't draw any conclusion to us being picked on by counsel, I think. it's fair game for everyone. I think there's a lot of equal opportunity to get sued in these areas these days with some of our peers. But bottom line, as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we are highly confident in our policy language terms conditions and are going to have to defend it over an extended period of time. Mike Zaremski : Understood. I think all investors have been happy to see so far the courts have sided with the industry. So thank you very much. Douglas Elliot : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yeah, thank you. Two questions. First one, so hopefully we talk a little bit better Doug about some of the reserving actions in the quarter. First, still a little surprise we're seeing, auto liability, commercial auto liability, adverse development, what's going on there? And then also, just the navigators, I know it's got the stop loss covered, but still a fair amount of development there. Is that well above expectations and where's that coming from is it M&A effect andloss picks currently? Douglas Elliot : So we'll start with auto liability. Our 2019, 2018, I'm sorry, 2018 tech was just a little light. So we felt like we had to top that up, Brian. Commercial auto liability has been a frustrating area for us over the last five to seven years. We have, I think, done a lot of underwriting work. We have priced aggressively. Obviously, we haven't caught all the trends. I think we're on top of it. As I mentioned in my script, our pricing now is in the teens in our middle market book and even stronger in our global specialty book. So if we understand it, I think we're in a better reserved position. And yes, it's been a little bit of a nagging issue that Beth and I just wanted to get on top of. Relative to navigators, I would describe the international DNO as specific situations that we had to make adjustments for in our reserves. There were certain cases that we just felt like our case reserves were not adequate. And then, in the U.S. book, I talk about general liability, we just strengthen our tail factors on the backside of some of our curves. So those are the two areas that in NAV, I think we made the appropriate adjustments with. Again, we understand that book more deeply today than we certainly did the day we purchased it, and I feel good about where we are. Beth Costello : And I just would add that to your other questions Ryan, it does not change our view of our current accident year picks, we feel very good about how that book is performing, feel very good with the progress that we're making on improving the profitability associated with that. So from that standpoint, no change there. Douglas Elliot : Brian just had one other comment, just on the overall feel. I continue to be really pleased with the overall performance of the acquisition, the team, the talent that we talked about. Modestly, I think our timing was really, really good, didn't know that we're going to go through a hard market, but we'll take a little tail wind at our side. And again, if you really remember when we announced this transaction, we purchased an ADC cover because we knew their reserves were short. We were willing to absorb obviously call it a loss layer of that the first 100 million, but then we did transact with a third-party to transfer all that risk from there. So we knew they were short. That's why we did the ADC. Honestly, it's not surprising to see where they're at right now. But that's the context of how we're thinking about the deal, and specifically the ADC. Christopher Swift : And I would just close, Brian on the liability pieces, we've talked about this publicly. We wanted more general liability, liability expertise in our portfolio. It was an area that we were working on organically. And so as we acquire the navigator, which is a core fundamental throughout their product family, we do that in a time of increased loss trend we understand that, and we've had to make some adjustments along the way. So I think that all sets up what happened in Q2 and over the last couple of quarters. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. And then second question, Chris. Just going back to some of your initial comments about the safe harbors that in the federal stimulus that we -- that the industry needs. I'm just curious, as you think about this going forward, what does it mean, if we don't get it? Is that something that you kind of contemplate in your kind of current casualty picks that maybe we do see a pickup in litigious activity? I mean, there's an article in the journal about it today. And is there any way that you can protect yourself as a commercial carrier with policy wording or anything are you doing that from some potential pickup in lawsuits? Christopher Swift : Yeah, it's a great point, Brian, I think it would add only to the impact of social inflation that we're experiencing today that everyone's talking about. So, yeah, I would say it's bad now and it could get worse going forward, if there isn't -- as I said temporary relief, right. I mean, we want people to try to go back to work and reopen the economy. And as long as there isn't called gross negligence or just bad behavior in players, I think vast majority would know better, but there's still needs to be a level of protection. I don't know what's feasible as far as litigation going forward, I hear more and more litigation each day that has happened as people think about returning to work and/or wrongful death claims this morning. I think really what it means is particularly in all our policies and we take a proactive stance in looking at policy terms and conditions and appropriate communicable disease exclusions are already in a lot of our general liability policies. But we'll continue to just be thoughtful and take necessary action we're appropriate with policy terms and conditions. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for us squeezing me in here. Just a couple of questions. One, looking at small commercial, I think you call out a couple of COVID items that impacted year-over-year results, I think if we check those out we got, still got to some year-over-year improvement. So want to hear what the favorable offsets were, Doug I think earlier, in response to another question you were talking about potential expense ratio improvements, but any color you can offer in small commercial will be appreciated? Douglas Elliot : So I think about small commercial, and I'm assuming you're looking at margin and xx. Essentially, when you adjust our quarterly underlying for COVID, you get an 871, which is, I think, a really competitive, terrific answer for their business. I have commented that we were impacted by COVID-19, relative to production, commented we expected that in the quarter, we watched that I'll also will share with you that our on the glass underwriting tool early March, when we saw this thing coming, we made adjustments on the glass for referrals to underwriters and certain classes that we just wanted extra sets of eyes and I'm sure that influenced a bit of the flow during the first 60 days. So, there are a lot of subtle factors that go into how we run that business, but I feel very good about our underlying margin, the adjustments we've made, and our go forward prospects. With all that said, we have to understand that we were watching carefully the reopening across the country. And we can't do this all on ourselves, we have to participate in the economy in large. Yaron Kinar : Doug, what I was trying to get out is, I think once you take out the COVID losses, the margin, -- the underlying margin actually improved in small commercial. And since you've called out some of the negatives, I was just curious as to what some of the favorable offsets were? Douglas Elliot : Well, there's a little bit of good news on the expense side. And I would say largely on the loss side, we didn't adjust many of the other picks. So we commented on the workers' comp news relative to COVID and quite a bit of that would be small commercial. But I don't think Yaron there's much else to talk about this one. We're talking about tense as opposed to significant points. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Okay. And then my second question, I'll just start off by saying I thought the disclosures around COVID were really excellent this quarter, so thank you for that. But I'm greedy in nature, so always looking for a little more. And I was just curious with regards to the $100 million property COVID loss, specifically that the portion that came from physical -- the policies without a physical damage trigger. Were you taking kind of full limit losses there? And also just curious as to why you're taking a quantitative approach on the -- on those policies that have physical damage triggers saying another 99% of policies, yet you're keeping the disclosure around virus or more qualitative, just in vast majority. Just wondering what's the thought process around the different treaty between the two was? Christopher Swift : Yaron, it's Chris. So what I would share with you on I'll call it the 99%. It's basically to sort of reinforce that business interruption is standard in most policies, but it does have a physical loss requirement. The second point that we were -- we have been making to people that we will listen is that, besides the direct physical loss requirement, we also have broad pollutants and contamination exclusions in again 99% of the policies, and those exclusions really bar coverage for any material that threatens human health or welfare. And then the third layer is like we said, virus, the virus exclusion which is the vast majority of our policies and that's how we think about sort of how policies are constructed. And sort of the terms and conditions and how it really works. And I almost think it as a waterfall. So you don't even get the virus, if you don't have a direct physical loss. And that's why I sort of put it last in the waterfall. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Christopher Swift : As far as it 100 million and the 1 million any additional detail at that point in time as far as policy limits and things like that, I'm just not going to comment upon. I mean, we looked at it in aggregate. We know what the policy limits are. We know what claims are coming in for you. We did exposure analysis on future claim activity that might come in and that's our number, and that's all I'm going to say. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you.

Christopher Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, The Hartford continued to deliver strong results, including core earnings of $527 million or $1.46 per diluted share, a trailing 12 months core earnings ROE of 12.3% and 5% growth in book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, from year-end 2019. These results in the midst of a pandemic and unusually high catastrophes demonstrates the progress of our strategic initiatives, strong execution, resilience and the dedication of our employees to serving our customers and distribution partners. Today, I'll review the key highlights for the quarter, beginning with the P&C business. In the third quarter, we saw very encouraging signs on our top line, pricing and margins. First, the total written premium stabilized. Although down compared to prior year quarter, new business was up substantially from the second quarter. As for pricing, the strong momentum of the last 3 quarters continued across most lines. U.S. Global Specialty saw the largest increase at 20%, and our Standard Commercial Lines was also strong, up 8.2%, excluding workers' compensation. And finally, underlying margins benefited from favorable pricing trends as well as recent actions to improve profitability and efficiency across the platform. Overall, Property & Casualty underlying margins, excluding COVID losses, improved 4.2 points versus prior year. The Commercial Lines underlying margin improved 1.8 points ex COVID, as each of our segment underlying margins were better than the prior year. Expanded margins reflect strong rate increases in nearly all lines, excluding workers' comp with stable loss cost trends. In our Standard Commercial Lines, margin improvement also reflected underwriting actions we began implementing prior to the overall market firming. In Global Specialty, the ex COVID combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2020 has improved significantly and is on track to achieve our full year margin improvement goal. I am very pleased with the team's performance, and the integration of this business to The Hartford platform. In Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio improved 10.9 points from prior year, which was offset by 15.7 points of catastrophe losses in the quarter. COVID-incurred losses in the third quarter were $72 million pretax with $37 million in P&C, primarily from workers' compensation and financial lines and the remaining $35 million in Group Benefits. These losses relate to claims from the third quarter and do not include any increase to previously reported second quarter COVID losses or our legal expense accrual. Included in these estimates are the retroactive workers' compensation presumptive actions taken in New Jersey and Connecticut during the quarter. Catastrophe losses of $229 million pretax were driven by significant storm and wildfire activity during the quarter. The industry experienced its second highest level of third quarter catastrophe losses since 2005. However, The Hartford's loss impact from these events was less than our market share would imply, reflecting strong risk management and underwriting discipline. Before turning to our investment results, let me just say that our thoughts are very much with all those dealing with the many challenges posed by this extraordinary year. While I believe the events of 2020 have once again highlighted the pivotal role played by the insurance industry in helping businesses, individuals and communities recover from catastrophes, it has also highlighted the inherent limitations of the industry. There continues to be the need for a healthy public-private partnership when it comes to issues like changing weather patterns and pandemics. As a result, we are committed to working with industry partners and public officials to find sustainable solutions to these challenges that are beyond the capital capacity of the insurance industry. Turning back to our results. Net investment income was $492 million, up materially from the second quarter, driven by contributions from limited partnership investments as valuations improved. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our Hartford Next program. As you will recall, Hartford Next is a transformational, multiyear, $500 million program focused on increasing our overall competitiveness. Initiatives are now underway to improve the effectiveness of our operations, while reducing costs, including investing in new automation and improved workflows. We remain on track to deliver lower run rate expenses, as previously shared. Turning to Group Benefits. Core earnings for the quarter were $116 million with a 7.9% margin, including $35 million pretax of COVID life and short-term disability losses. The disability loss ratio was 65.3%, up 0.9 point due to $7 million of pretax short-term COVID disability losses and a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter that benefited from more favorable claim recoveries on long-term disability. The underlying performance of our disability book of business remains quite strong with favorable claim recoveries and incidence trends. We are closely watching long-term disability trends in light of elevated unemployment levels. The life loss ratio of 87.5% increased 6.7 points from the third quarter of 2019 due to COVID-related losses of $28 million pretax as well as updated reserving assumptions for late reported claims. On the top line, book persistency remains solid at approximately 90%. Sales for the quarter were up 81% versus prior year, driven by several national account wins. Despite strong persistency in sales, total premium is down 1.5%. This decline is due to lower premium on in-force cases as businesses reduced their employee base in response to recessionary pressures. All in, from a top line and bottom line perspective, I'm very pleased with our Group Benefits results. As we move through the final quarter of 2020, it is clear that The Hartford's digital journey over the last several years has been an important part of our current success and will be crucial to our future. Despite operating in a remote environment, we have been able to maintain outstanding service and support for customers and distribution partners. Since January, we have achieved a significant increase in the adoption of digital tools by customers, agents and brokers across our businesses. Some examples include : a 60% increase in small commercial endorsements processed online, a 36% increase in quotes that started online for our AARP Personal Lines and an online completion rate of 71% for premium audits. In addition, for the second year in a row, our Small Commercial business plays first for customer-facing digital capabilities in the Keynova annual study. I will close with some comments on the P&C industry hardening price market. At the beginning of 2020, I forecasted a firming pricing environment would continue for 18 to 24 months. I now see the potential for a longer runway. Current market conditions are driving the need for higher rates, even more than a year ago when the firming first started. Factors behind the hardening market include social inflation, which remains a very real concern and one we are watching for signs of increased exposure; catastrophe losses that remain above-average levels as we deal with the ongoing impact of changing weather patterns; a pandemic that continues to weigh on the economy and threatens human health; and a prolonged low interest rate environment, putting added pressure on the need for underwriting profits to make up for lost yield. In spite of the many challenges we face as an industry and a country, I am optimistic about The Hartford's performance in the coming quarters as our results benefit from continued margin improvement, innovation that enables us to serve customers better and initiatives targeting improved operating efficiencies and expense reductions. Now I'll turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Elliott : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Across our business, we remain focused on the underlying fundamentals, including pricing, underwriting and expense management, while we continue to manage the still emerging impacts of the global pandemic. Multiple catastrophes also provided added challenge to the quarterly results. Nevertheless, progressing levels of economic activity contributed to a much improved top line trajectory during the quarter, and we're pleased with the progress achieved on many of our 2020 initiatives, as I will comment on this morning. Overall, Property and Casualty core earnings were $428 million for the quarter, and written premium was $3 billion, down 3% from prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 90.6, included $37 million or 1.2 points of COVID losses, was 3 points lower than last year. Excluding COVID losses, each of our businesses reported underlying margin improvement. Before I get into the segment details, let me summarize the actions we took this quarter with respect to COVID losses, CATs and prior year development. In Commercial Lines, incurred COVID underwriting losses of $37 million were down significantly from the second quarter. Gross workers' compensation COVID losses were $65 million, including a retroactive provision for presumptive coverage in New Jersey and Connecticut. Offsetting the gross loss was continued non-COVID-specific favorable workers' compensation frequency of $48 million, driving a net impact of $17 million. Financial lines and other losses were $20 million, primarily for D&O and E&O. Turning to catastrophes. We incurred $229 million in the quarter. Industry losses were also elevated due in large part to Pacific Coast wildfires, hurricane Laura, tropical storm Isaias and the Midwest derecho event. We have made significant advances in our CAT modeling and underwriting capabilities. For example, we're confident our incurred wildfire losses in the quarter were lower due to specific underwriting actions taken previously. Over the last 2 years, we have reduced our overall California homeowners policy count approximately 17%, and our footprint in the 5 costliest wildfires this season is down 35% over that same time period. Net favorable prior year development for the quarter was $75 million. We continued to experience favorable loss emergence in workers' compensation, Small Commercial Spectrum liability and Personal Lines auto liability. U.S. professional liability claim activity is also developing favorably. Within the Navigators business, we increased prior year reserves $14 million primarily in wholesale construction. The entire increase was reinsured by the adverse development cover. Turning now to our business line results. The Commercial Lines third quarter underlying combined ratio was 93.7, slightly better than prior year. Favorable property results and a lower expense ratio were partially offset by 1.6 points for COVID losses and a few large marine losses in the international Global Specialty book.  A few comments about the expense ratio. First, reduced travel and incentive compensation are contributors this year. Second, we're starting to see some modest early wins from our Hartford Next transformation program, which will carry into subsequent quarters. And finally, we continue to benefit from actions we took this year to reduce acquisition costs. As I pivot to pricing, we continue to achieve excellent pricing gains. For the quarter, renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.7%, nearly flat with Q2. Excluding workers' compensation, pricing was a solid 8.2%, slightly ahead of our strong second quarter. Layering in U.S. Global Specialty lines, brings ex workers' comp Commercial Lines pricing to approximately 11% for the quarter, a very strong result. In Middle Market, renewal written pricing in the U.S., excluding workers' compensation, increased 10.3%, up just over 0.5 point from second quarter and 440 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2019. Property, general liability and auto pricing are holding steady near or slightly above double digits. In Global Specialty, we're also seeing continued strong pricing gains in both our U.S. wholesale book as well as the international portfolio, which is primarily written in Lloyd's. The U.S. wholesale book achieved 26 points of rate in the third quarter, up 1 point from quarter 2. Auto was in the low teens, while property lines are now in the mid-20s and excess casualty in the mid-30s. Both property and excess casualty are approximately 5 points higher than last quarter. Pricing gains in the international portfolio remained steady with very strong results in professional lines, energy and cargo. Let me now share a few more details on our commercial businesses. Small Commercial posted an underlying combined ratio of 87.7, 0.7 point better than third quarter 2019 when COVID losses of 0.5 point are excluded. Small Commercial written premium was down 1% versus prior year. Driven by favorable audit premiums, the result was much better than we expected 90 days ago. Top line will continue to be impacted by somewhat lower exposures as a result of COVID impacts on the economy. Small Commercial new business declined 14% versus prior year, yet it's up 9% versus the second quarter. Spectrum, our industry-leading packaged product, saw a 15% sequential growth and record new business in September. Our new Spectrum product delivers insurance coverage recommendations tailored to individual small businesses, real-time transparent pricing and uses advanced analytics to prefill underwriting information and classify risks for an unparalleled agent quoting experience. I am thrilled with the results and the outstanding feedback received from our agents. As expected, policy retention in Small Commercial was lower in the quarter, largely driven by the billing hold actions from the second quarter. Premium retention also declined, but to a lesser extent, as the average premium of canceled policies was lower, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on Main Street America and the micro segment of Small Commercial. Combining these past 2 quarters, average policy retention remains strong. Turning to Middle & Large Commercial. We reported an underlying combined ratio of 97.7 in the third quarter, 3.5 points better than prior year after excluding COVID losses of 1.6 points. A favorable expense ratio, lower non-CAT property and improved national account losses drove the ex COVID margin improvement. Written premium declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by the impact of lower insured exposure. New business in Middle Market was down 10% versus prior year but up 32% from the second quarter. Submission flow, hit ratio and average premium in our core Middle Market book all improved over second quarter levels. While retention declined, I continue to be pleased with the margin improvement driven by our pricing and underwriting actions. Moving to Global Specialty. Written premiums declined 2% in the quarter. The domestic U.S. business grew 5% with solid contributions across most lines, while international written premium declined 23%, driven by underwriting actions to improve the profitability of the book. The underlying combined ratio was 98.2 this quarter, 1.6 points better than prior year after excluding COVID losses of 3.6 points. Margin improvement in U.S. wholesale and a lower expense ratio were partially offset by $11 million or 2 points from 4 large losses in the international marine book, including the Beirut and Tilbury port explosions. I do not see these losses as a trend, rather we expect to incur large losses in this book from time to time. We continue to be pleased with margin expansion in Global Specialty. Year-to-date, the underlying combined ratio was 100%, including 5.5 points for COVID losses. Excluding the impact of COVID, we've seen approximately 4 points of improvement from the second half of 2019, almost entirely coming from the Navigators book. Shifting over to Personal Lines. Written premiums declined 5% in the quarter. The result was partly impacted by the catch-up cancellations from the second quarter's grace period extension, along with the continued declines in the agency book. New business premium declined 10%, driven by lower responses, which outweighed an increase in conversion rates. Responses were up a very strong 9% in the second quarter, so some of this decline was expected. Despite lower growth, we had another strong quarter of underwriting results. In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio of 84.9 was 13.9 points better than 2019. Consistent with the industry, frequency continues to run well below prior year. However, due to the demographics of our customer base, our third quarter frequency reduction of plus 20% has been better than industry results. We expect this trend to return to historical levels with the adoption of therapeutics and the introduction of a vaccine targeted for 2021. In home, the underlying combined ratio of 74% was 2.6 points better than prior year, driven predominantly by favorable non-CAT weather in the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Beth, let me close by saying that I'm encouraged by our momentum on a number of fronts. After a very challenging second quarter, Commercial Lines written premium and new business momentum picked up in the third quarter, gaining traction with written premium almost back to prior levels. Pricing continues to be strong, and our underwriting actions across Global Specialty and Middle Market books are demonstrating progress. And our view of loss cost trends for accident year 2020 have not materially changed. With continued strong written pricing achieved in nearly all lines, except workers' compensation, we are clearly exceeding loss cost trends across most of our book. We need improved underwriting performance to offset the continued downward pressure on investment income, as Beth will describe. I look forward to updating you on our progress and results after year-end. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Doug. Today, I'm going to review the third quarter results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and Corporate. Net investment income was $492 million for the quarter, which was about even with the prior year as increased limited partnership returns and higher make-whole payments offset declines caused by low interest rates. The current yield before tax, excluding limited partnerships, was 3.3%, down from 3.6% in the third quarter of last year. We expect the investment yield, excluding limited partnerships, in the fourth quarter to decline about 20 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting lower yields on short-term investments and lower reinvestment rates and no expectations for make-whole payments. During the quarter, we reduced our liquidity level, which represents cash and short-term investments adjusted for unsettled trades and securities collateral from approximately 7% to approximately 5.6% of total invested assets at the end of the quarter. With continued strong cash flow generation, we expect to further reduce liquidity levels targeting 5% by the end of the year. Credit performance on the portfolio was very strong for the quarter. We reduced our mortgage loan reserve by $5 million and recognized $1 million of net impairments on fixed maturities. The net unrealized gain position on the fixed maturity portfolio increased from $2.6 billion before tax at June 30 to $3 billion before tax at September 30. Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings of $40 million were up 3% from last year. This is primarily due to higher average assets under management combined with lower expenses, largely offset by a decrease in fee income reflecting a continued shift to lower fee generating funds. As of September 30, almost 70% of Hartford Funds outperformed peers on a 3- and 5-year basis. The Corporate core loss of $57 million in the quarter was $20 million higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the company's retained equity interest in Talcott Resolution. For the quarter, we recorded a $21 million pretax loss from Talcott, primarily due to hedge losses experienced in the second quarter, driven by strong equity market performance. In September, we received a cash dividend from Talcott of $30 million. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we will complete our annual study of asbestos and environmental reserves. Under the adverse development cover we purchased in 2016, we have $860 million of remaining coverage available for potential future adverse development in these reserves. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, we ceded $14 million to our adverse development cover for Navigators. After this session, we have $96 million of coverage remaining under the ADC. In September, we signed an agreement to sell the Navigators legal entities that operate in Continental Europe. We were very pleased to reach this agreement as the go-forward focus of our international business is principally in the Lloyd's market. With this agreement, we recognized a loss on sale of $32 million after tax. Finally, we are executing on our Hartford Next initiative. As a reminder, this program will improve our overall efficiency and achieve annual operating expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2022, contributing to our goal of reducing our 2019 P&C expense ratio by 2 to 2.5 points, our Group Benefits expense ratio by 1.5 to 2 points and our loss expense ratio by 0.5 point. We were very pleased with our execution during the quarter and realized savings from Hartford Next slightly above our expectations. We incurred pretax restructuring costs of $87 million, which were recognized outside of core earnings, including $78 million of accrued severance. As it relates to the fourth quarter, I would expect the P&C expense ratio to be about 31.5, which would be about a 2-point reduction from the prior fourth quarter, reflecting continuation of the impacts of the current environment we are operating in, as Doug mentioned, as well as the impact of Hartford Next. Before moving to Q&A, I wanted to provide a high-level overview of our workers' compensation and property reinsurance programs as it relates to COVID losses. We have various reinsurance programs to mitigate losses, including an aggregate property CAT treaty and excess of loss occurrence-based treaties that cover property and workers' compensation. Our workers' compensation program provides coverage of $350 million excess of $100 million for losses occurring from a common origin, which occur within a defined period of time, commonly referred to as an hours clause. Based on current loss activity, we have not booked a recovery under this program as we believe it is unlikely for coverage to attach. Our property CAT aggregate program requires a PCS CAT designation for events in the U.S. Since the pandemic caused by COVID has not been designated a PCS event, COVID losses are not covered by this program. Our property CAT occurrence program does not require a PCS designation and does not exclude pandemic. This program begins attaching for losses in excess of $150 million. If losses breach our retention, we would have the opportunity for recovery under the terms and conditions of the contract, including applicable hour clauses. To date, our property losses do not reach this level, and accordingly, we have not booked any recovery from this program. Additional details on our reinsurance programs can be found in our Form 10-Q. To recap, despite the many challenges in 2020, our results benefited from execution on financial and strategic goals. I'm very encouraged by the underlying strength of our businesses and confident that we have the right initiatives in place to continue to deliver on our stated goals. As per our practice, we plan to share our outlook of 2021 financial metrics in February on our year-end earnings call. I'll now turn the call over to Susan so we can begin the Q&A session. Susan Bernstein : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Andrew will take our first question. Operator : The first question comes from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Chris and, maybe, Doug, in opening comments, you've talked about margin expansion. Obviously, you had some decent amount in Commercial Lines ex the COVID. Chris, your comments for -- with pricing, stable loss trends, and your underwriting actions before the market started to firm has allowed for this and should continue. I guess when you talk about stable loss trends there that's helped your margins, are you also including what we're seeing from COVID with frequency? And then maybe you can give some thoughts on how -- you talked about how that's going to continue in 2021, the level -- or should this continue the margin expansion into full year 2021? Christopher Swift : Michael, I'll share my views, and Doug, I know, will share his. So yes, we feel really good about the execution of various initiatives over the last 12 months. And I tried to highlight the impact, even prior to COVID there were certain aspects of our book of business that we were targeted for underwriting improvement, particularly in Middle Market. So a lot of those activities started prior to COVID. I think what we're seeing right now, and if you look at the numbers in the third quarter, we had net $17 million of COVID impact. So there's a gross impact, and there's a benefit, and it's relatively minor. So right now, what at least we feel in workers' comp is an offsetting impact on COVID-related losses from a frequency benefit of just slower economic activity. And as I tried to conclude in my prepared remarks, Michael, the lower interest rate environment, the social inflation factors that are still out there, catastrophes that seem to be elevated in the last 3 or 4 years to my metric-driven mind, all point to that we just need to continue to get after and expand underwriting margins to earn adequate returns on our capital. But Doug, what would you add? Douglas Elliott : Mike, I would just add that it was a core priority of ours this year to improve our returns in Middle Market and Global Specialty, for sure. We gave you the underlying ex COVID, so you could look underneath COVID and understand what those changes are. And I'm quite pleased that both those businesses were seeing real progress. We're willing to forego some top line to achieve that initiative. And obviously, those goals were set pre-COVID. But when I look through COVID, I feel underlying 3.5 point improvement in Middle, and I feel the Navigators book is really improving as we expected. So I'm quite pleased by 9 months of the year so far. And I would just conclude with, as Chris and I talked about the forward trends, we talked a lot about written pricing trends. They will earn in, in the ensuing quarters. So we expect an improving earned premium impact as we go into '21. Michael Phillips : Okay. Second question on -- you put up about $40 million of legal defense in 2Q. It looks like that's still holding in 3Q, I guess. As you think about COVID and litigation expense, how confident are you that that's enough given, I guess, the spotlight that seems to be on companies like you for COVID litigation? And then any concerns you might have for your exposure should maybe a second, third, fourth, whatever number you want to pick, of shutdowns occur in the near term? Christopher Swift : Yes. There's a lot to unpack there. So -- well, I'll try. I would say in our overall COVID litigation posture, we remain very confident in our policy language, how that's been constructed, the clarity, the unambiguous terms that we use. And as we sit here today, the $40 million accrual, we did not change. That's established with a mindset that this litigation is going to take some time to fully resolve. But again, we're confident. As it relates to your last point in the question as far as, I think, COVID impacts in second waves, third waves, however you want to frame it, yes, it's very real. And you could see the beginnings of it right now as the winter turns. So I would just frame it for you from an economic perspective, is that the next 2 quarters are probably going to be a little rough from an economic side. Our forecast would say that we would have about a 3% contraction in the economic activity at the end of '20 compared to '19. But when you then get into '21 compared to '20, we could see a 3.5% to 4% economic expansion, particularly, as Doug said in his comments, as vaccines come on board, as we get more treatments to keep people healthy. So I think the trends are all in the right direction, Michael, but it's hard to predict what is really going to happen in the near term, and that's what we're bracing for. But Doug, what would you add? Douglas Elliott : I think that's well said, Chris. Nothing to add. Operator : The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on the capital side of things. You guys have a good amount of capital, $1.6 billion at the holding company. Just trying to get an update on thoughts around repurchases. And what you guys are looking for when you contemplate a return to buying back your stock? Christopher Swift : Yes. Thank you for noticing, Elyse. And you're right, we have built up excess capital during the last 7 months. And again, that was partly by design to deal with any unknowns that might come our way. But as we sit here today, I mean, we're still operating in a pandemic environment. The economic outlook is a little foggy, particularly as it relates to fiscal policy coming out of Congress. So I would say we're just waiting for just slightly a little bit more clarity. And then as we head into '21 and we share our business plans with you and our metric drivers, we will also update you on our capital management actions. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the pricing trends that you're seeing within workers' comp. Are the decreases that you're seeing there still decelerating? I think you alluded to that last quarter. And then can you give us a sense of how the asset in your picks for your book year-to-date this year compared to 2019? Douglas Elliott : Yes. Let me start with the first part of that, Elyse. So when we think about color on pricing trends, I would start by saying that there really isn't anything in the quarter that surprised us. Our Middle Market workers' comp quarter-to-quarter pricing trends were about flat, second quarter to third quarter. And we saw a little bit of deterioration, about 1 point, on the workers' comp Small Commercial book, keeping in mind that Small Commercial, as I said in the past, is less subject to underwriter actions, it's more slot-rated, and it's in that small negative single digits in our expectation zone for 2020. So not surprised by anything that happened in the quarter. This is not, Elyse, as you know, a new story. The negative trends were deeper -- slightly deeper last year, and we expected to face into these headwinds on the pricing side with comp now. And we're spending a lot of time thinking about the next several quarters as we and others get ready to make our filings in the various states on the workers' compensation line. So that's my color on workers' comp. I don't think it was a big new story in the quarter from my end. Relative to margins, I guess I would say 2 things. There are a lot of underwriting activities happening in the Middle. So the Middle underwriting story is a combination of underwriting and pricing. And there, I think we feel pretty good about where we are, and I don't see any compression in our Middle Market. In fact, optimistic that we'll see improvement. In Small Commercial, we said to you at the beginning of the year when we forecasted 2020, we expected small compression pressure. And we're seeing that slightly, although 2020 you know has got so many moving parts because of COVID. So we've tried to look through them. And when I give you that margin component pressure, I'm really looking through COVID because, as you know, we're seeing very positive signs of favorable frequency from COVID. So there are a lot of things happening with workers' comp. We're spending a lot of time on the issue. I feel like our team is all over it by state, by geography, by class. But there isn't anything happening in our loss trends right now that we would say would be surprising. We feel like we're on top of it. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : I want to push on Elyse's thoughts a little bit. Workers' comp is more regulated than a lot of other lines of business. But also workers' comp is probably more interest rate-sensitive than other lines of business. And obviously, that's a huge driver of what's going on right now. Can you talk us a little about the process of getting rate approvals in workers' comp? It's been 6 months since the big decline in interest rates. To what extent are regulators responsive to that? To what extent is there a lag in workers' comp pricing changes versus other lines? How should we think about 2021 and the way regulators think about interest rates? Douglas Elliott : Sure, Josh. I'd start by saying that right now, the industry over the past several months and extending forward is in the middle of filing, working on rate changes for workers' comp for 2021. I would remind you that much of the experience base for those filings would be 2019, right? We're working a year in arrears. And 2019 was a very good year from the industry. So on one side, you have a pretty solid year underlying next year's pricing expectations. On the other, as you described, no question, there's been a change in the yield curve and all companies like ourselves are factoring that in. So you have competing forces, and then I might add, these are very state-specific. So all of us have our own loss experience in the state that we're looking at overall industry experience, our loss experience, trying to factor all that in. And now we have a new dynamic, obviously, with COVID that will enter the picture as we move over the next several quarters. So a lot happening in the workers' comp line, a lot happening in states relative to presumption. Not all states have taken presumptive activity, but that is basically the way the process works. Joshua Shanker : And then switching gears to Personal Lines. There's -- obviously, State Farm has announced some big price cuts. There's other large competitors cutting. You haven't grown in Personal Lines in a long time, certainly on policy count. When we think about the next year or 2, do we see a path for Hartford to stabilize its drip of declining policy numbers? And what sort of strategies can Hartford use to maybe even grow that business a little bit? Christopher Swift : Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. I would anchor it on our AARP, obviously, relationship where 90% of our business comes from and our renewed contract, our renewed terms and conditions with them, plus our commitment to build a modern platform chassis to help grow that business for their benefit and our benefit. So we've been at it, I would say, quite hard for the last 12 to 15 months. We start to roll out a home and auto product in early '21 on the new platform. We got a number of states that will fast follow after that. So yes, we are thinking dramatically different about the marketplace, thinking about digital, thinking about telematics and really just modernizing our auto and home offering. But that's what I would say. Doug, would you add anything? Douglas Elliott : I think that's good, Chris. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : A couple of ones here for you. First one, I'm just curious, where are we with respect to some of the reunderwriting actions that's going on with the old Navigators book, clearly still causing some pressures on top line? And is that at all impacting your ability to take advantage of this pretty terrific pricing environment where a lot of the, call it, E&S specialty players are seeing really substantial growth? Douglas Elliott : Yes. Brian, we are well through what I would say round 1. So clearly into 12, 13, 14 months of the progression. Secondly, I do not think that our underwriting activities are standing in the way of what we're able to achieve on pricing advances for customers that we intend to retain for long periods of time. They just need a different price level and very pleased that we're able to achieve that. And then lastly, I think it's well known, but I'm just going to state it. There are profit pressures within many of the Lloyd's syndicates. And our syndicate has clearly not performed to our objective. And so we've taken appropriate actions to get our margins back where they need to be. And yes, that has meant that we've had more top line pressure than probably we had hoped. But I'm encouraged that our bottom line margin performance will be much improved. And yes, we will take advantage of the pricing dynamic because the market needs it, those products demand it, and we're going to achieve it. Brian Meredith : Got you. But as far as the new business outlook there, probably not really good for at least the near term as you continue these fixes? Douglas Elliott : I would say that we're actively involved in the new business. Now it has to fit our profile and our activity. So we've made some choices to move away from some of the other European countries, and we've moved away from some classes that we just do not see a way toward profitability. But in our core professional marine lines and others, Brian, we are open for business, and I think you will see further growth as we get out behind this reunderwriting process that is largely behind us. Brian Meredith : Great. And then pivoting over to Group Benefits. The margins there continue to be, ex COVID, stellar. How much of that do you think is just the environment we're in right now? Kind of have you kind of rethought what kind of a normalized core margin in that business kind of looks like? Christopher Swift : Brian, yes, it is good. It's a good margin. If you really look through COVID, it's comparable to maybe slightly up compared to last quarter. I just would remind you, we did guide to 6.5% to 7% margin this year. I still think that's a good long-term anchor point for a margin on this business that equates into strong returns on capital. So that's what I would say. Right now, it feels good that we're printing the numbers we are, but there's pressures building, particularly from a competitive side, I could feel right now. Operator : The next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Beth, I was hoping you could look over or share your thoughts on positives and negatives with regard to reinsurance coverage over the course of 2020, like what parts worked as expected and what parts didn't. Beth Bombara : Yes, I would characterize that overall, our reinsurance programs have worked exactly as designed and exactly for the coverages that we were looking to mitigate risk in. So there's nothing that I would point to that would say that our contracts are not in line with our expectations. Meyer Shields : Okay. So can I extrapolate from that, that you don't anticipate major changes going into 2021? Beth Bombara : I mean we're still right now, obviously, in the process of looking at those renewals, but structurally in the way that the program is designed and the types of exposures that we're looking to mitigate, would expect it to be very consistent. Meyer Shields : Okay. And then just more, I think, of a philosophical question than anything else. But Chris, you've been very consistent in your confidence in defenses against BI. How do you reserve for the likelihood that some courts are going to make bad decisions? Christopher Swift : So yes, we -- as we said in the second quarter, we did not put any BI-specific reserves up. So we think the policy language, as I said, is clear, it's unambiguous, and we're going to defend ourselves. So we'll have to see how things play out over a longer period of time. And unfortunately, Meyer, I've spent so many hours with our lawyers reviewing strategy and approach. And I wish there was a quick fix to sort of get rid of this overhang, but that's just not the way our legal systems work. And you're just going to have to be a little patient as we work through this litigation environment. I mean we're still very early in this, and it's just going to take time. Operator : The next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Couple of questions. One, with regards to Group Benefits, we're hitting the 180-day mark, I think, now from when the crisis, the COVID crisis began. Do you expect to start seeing some long-term disability claims coming in over the next quarter or 2? And maybe you could talk about kind of the magnitude of those relative to what we've seen in short-term disability so far? Christopher Swift : Yes. Yaron, as we said in our prepared remarks, the trends both on recoveries, which is important, plus, obviously, new incidents remain strong. You're right, the first quarter of, in essence, earned premium on LTD is coming out of that 180-day elimination period. And as I said before, we don't see any new trends emerging at this point in time. It's only obviously one quarter. But -- I mean you can see in the data a slight to modest increase in incidences that we're just watching closely at this point in time. But I'm not here saying we've declared a new trend, but it's just clearly a watch area. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then I was curious, if you could respond here to Josh's question earlier with regards to the Personal Lines business side. I think you mentioned that you're looking into digital and telematics. And I guess, intuitively, I didn't think that, that would necessarily be an area that would necessarily be, I guess, most conducive to the AARP market, if you will. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about that. And what do you think the take-up rate would be on digital distribution and on telematics for the AARP market? Christopher Swift : Yaron, I'm AARP Hartford customer. Are you calling me digital-naive? In all honesty, it's a changing trend, and it's part of our joint strategy, and I'll let Doug add his commentary. AARP does want to grow in the 50- to 65-year-old, I'll call it, mature segment. We want to grow with them in that side of the marketplace. And digital, mobile, telematics is all part of the future from a number of different perspectives. Obviously, ease, there's some concerns about using credit in underwriting in the future that some regulators are bringing up. And then obviously, the COVID environment, I think, has taught us a lesson of sort of you can have more on-demand insurance in this space. So it's all part of our strategy to modernize that platform going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Jamminder Bhullar : So I first had a question maybe for Chris, Beth or Doug, just on where acquisitions fall in your whole plan on capital deployment. There is one of your competitors that's trying to sort of sell an affinity block, a Personal Lines affinity block. So is acquisition something that you're interested in currently? And then secondly, on Group Benefits, what are you seeing in terms of persistency, both at the case level and, more importantly, at the client level and your outlook for premiums given high unemployment? Christopher Swift : Sure. Yes, Jimmy, on the first one, what I would say is M&A is a low priority for us right now. We have, I would say, 50% of the integration activities at Navigators completed at this point in time. We need to finish that. I think there are wonderful organic growth opportunities that we're focused on with our excess capital. And as I alluded to, when we talk about capital management in early '21, I think it's a beautiful time to be buying our shares back, particularly in relation to intrinsic value. So I put it all together, and M&A is just a low priority to us. Particularly, I think the opportunity you're referring to is a mass market Personal Lines opportunity, and that doesn't fit our profile to allocate incremental capital to at this point in time. As it relates to GB persistency, as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm generally pleased with the persistency that's about 90% through the year. So overall, I'll call it, account persistency is good, but the trend that we are seeing, and it just happens automatically, is that monthly payrolls are coming down in all segments, whether it be national accounts or Middle Market or smaller end of priority accounts with unemployment going up in a shock fashion. People are reducing premiums, and that's what\u2019s created most of the drag that we've seen, but persistency, new business activities are returning to normal levels, although slightly down. So that's what I would share with you, Jimmy. Operator : The next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Just a follow-up question for Doug on Commercial Lines. If I look at the accident year loss ratio ex CAT and I take COVID out, it was around 59% this quarter. That was up from second quarter, but still was down 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year. I'm just wondering did you guys benefit at all from any favorable frequency on casualty lines ex workers' comp? Or are you guys still holding your picks steady there? Douglas Elliott : David, we are largely holding our casualty picks steady there. We want to see the maturity inside those trend lines. And as such, we feel like those years -- 2020 accident year is still immature in our deeper casualty lines. David Motemaden : Got it. That makes sense. And so just thinking about going forward, is 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year improvement in sort of underlying loss ratio a good baseline for how we should think about 2021? Douglas Elliott : I would say that we're going to help you a lot more with that question in 90 days. Part of the reason I say that is, there's so many different stories inside Commercial Lines, and we've got to roll it back up. There are lines where our pricing on a written basis are several hundred basis points ahead of loss trend, there are lines where it's tighter. And so as we get a better look at it in terms of what fourth quarter is all about and we kind of pull together our final details with 2021 plans, we will share that with you, but we are clearly leaning into margin improvement next year relative to these lines, where we're achieving strong pricing gains. David Motemaden : Okay. Got it. That makes sense. That's fair. And if I could just -- just my second question, on Small Commercial. The top line was a bit more resilient than what I would have thought there. So that's great to see. It sounded like the loss accounts were lower premium accounts. But I'm just wondering if you can expand on anything else that helped the top line there and maybe how you're thinking about Small Commercial top line going forward? Douglas Elliott : Yes. Good question. Let me do 2 things with that. And then we can go wherever you want to go. First thing I would say is that we've adjusted our underwriting strategy over these past 8 months. When COVID hit, we certainly increased our referral activity, referral to underwriter activity, taking away some of the abilities of CSRs to quote us and bind us online. And that definitely had an impact on the top line. Over the course of the last 8 months, we've modified that as we've learned more about the virus, and we've worked that through our underwriting protocols. And as such, I think that's given us a little bit of punch, positive punch on the back side of Q3. So I'd start there. Secondly, as you look at our Supplement on Page 14, where we give you some in-depth detail with retention, we've tried to describe for folks that as you look at the PIF retention, particularly with Small Commercial, we were benefiting in second quarter because essentially we had cancellation holds on all those accounts that were nonpaying because of our moratorium. And as they lifted during the month of June into July, depending upon state, we saw the impact downward in the third quarter. So if you put Q2 and Q3 together, you look at a PIF retention that's really stable throughout the year and very consistent with prior years. The same impact is going on with premium retention. So this is a dollar retention. And again, lots of things were happening in Q2. But we're feeling a little bit of the exposure pressure from payroll down in our 82 calc, and I'm looking at Small Commercial in Q3 in the Supp. So I look at the fundamentals underneath this IFS supplement that we share as very solid and very encouraging, as I shared, momentum as we closed out Q3 and jumped into Q4. I say that all with the caveat, as Chris described, that we don't control what happens in the COVID pandemic economic environment. But I feel really good about our engine. I feel like our product, particularly on the Spectrum side, is well understood and now fully appreciated with the digital capabilities. And I'm pretty bullish about where we're going to go in Small, subject to challenges, headwinds of the environment we face into. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Spivak Bernstein for any closing remarks. Susan Bernstein : Thank you, Andrew.

Replays of this call and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford\u2019s website for one year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying we have been through one of the most turbulent years in recent history, which has been shaped by an extraordinary set of circumstances including the worst pandemic in more than 100 years and in its wake devastating economic and emotional fallout; a collective reckoning with racial inequality that continues to challenge America and the increasing vivid reminders that our climate is changing.  Despite these challenges, The Hartford continued to deliver strong results with core earnings of $636 million or $1.76 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 12.7. For the year, core earnings were $2.1 billion or $5.78 per diluted share and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was $47.16, up 8% from 2019. The Hartford\u2019s performance reflects the strength of our businesses, our execution on strategic priorities, and builds a solid foundation for our company\u2019s future sustainable success. I want to thank all my colleagues across The Hartford. I am incredibly proud of the resiliency demonstrated by our employees and their commitment to our stakeholders during this unusual time while balancing the demands of work and family. Now turning to the business and 2021 outlook, property and casualty underlying underwriting results significantly improved in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020, with strong performances in both commercial and personal lines. Excluding the impact of COVID, commercial lines\u2019 underlying margins expanded by 6.5 points in the fourth quarter and 1.6 points in 2020, with improvement coming from all businesses. These results were in line or better than the guidance we provided a year ago and were driven by higher pricing, adherence to our underwriting disciplines, and operating efficiencies. In commercial lines, pricing momentum continues across nearly all lines, excluding workers\u2019 compensation and we expect pricing increases to continue as additional rate is needed to offset pressure from social inflation, more frequent catastrophe events, and the persistent low interest rate environment.  In commercial lines, our teams are executing strongly on a number of fronts. In global specialty, the strategic transaction to acquire Navigators is on track. The integration is proceeding well and it is providing us with expanded product breadth in middle market and global specialty. In 2020, we have met our goal of improving financial performance in the business compared to the second half of 2019 and the acquisition was well timed from a market perspective. Small commercial results remain excellent. We continue to strengthen our competitive advantages and market leadership position. The launch earlier in the year of our new business owners policy raised the bar for customer experience in buying and managing coverage. Going forward, we have a robust strategy to grow through product innovation and will continue to invest to maintain our industry-leading digital experience. I am excited about what we will continue to accomplish in this business. In middle and large commercial, we completed year one of a three-year plan to transform the underwriting process, provide a differentiated customer experience, and grow our specialized verticals. In the fourth quarter, underlying margins improved by 4.4 points compared to prior year, primarily due to lower expense ratio. In addition, our broader and deeper product set and enhanced analytics will drive further growth and improved margins. Moving to personal lines, underlying margins improved in both the fourth quarter and the year, benefiting from continued favorable auto frequency, lower non-cat incurred property losses, and reduced expenses. In 2020, we extended our AARP relationship with a new contract that runs through the end of 2032 solidifying our unique value proposition for the 50 and over demographic. We are also investing in a new digital platform to administer and market our products. Doug will provide more detail, and I am excited about the new auto and home products we will launch in the next six months. In summary for P&C, 2020 performance was strong despite challenges of the pandemic and COVID losses. In 2021, we expect continued modest COVID losses in workers\u2019 compensation and financial lines, and while we are encouraged that the vaccine rollout has begun, we are learning it will take more time than initially projected to achieve protection across the broader population. With this outlook, we are expecting our commercial lines\u2019 underlying combined ratio excluding the impact of COVID in both years to improve by approximately 3 points from 2020 results to a range of 88.5 to 90.5. The margin expansion alone is significant. When coupled with our business mix, it\u2019s an ambitious but achievable outcome.  In personal lines, our outlook for 2021 incorporates an assumption that driving patterns begin to return to more normal levels and property results are more in line with historical trends. The result is an expected underlying combined ratio in the range of 87 to 89. I am very bullish about our growth potential and expect to increase our top line at a faster rate than we have experienced over the past five years. While some of this growth reflects a positive pricing environment, we see the increasing opportunity to utilize our brand, people, enhanced underwriting capabilities, and excellence in customer service to capture market share.  Before moving to group benefits, I want to briefly comment upon the business interruption loss suits brought against The Hartford and the industry. While we are extremely sympathetic to the difficulties faced by our insureds and all businesses dealing with the pandemic, the claims against us are outside the scope of our policies. All of our property policies subject to litigation plainly require direct physical loss or damage to trigger coverage, and the COVID-19 virus clearly does not cause such loss or damage. Although it is still early in the life cycle of some of these cases, we are pleased the overwhelming majority of decisions to date by federal and state courts across the country have held in favor of the insurance carriers and recognized that the presence of the virus does not make a direct physical loss or damage trigger for coverage. Given the number of lawsuits, it\u2019s not surprising that some initial rulings have gone against the industry. Where appropriate, these cases have been or will likely be appealed and I am confident appellate courts will properly consider the growing body of precedent in favor of the industry. Nevertheless, a few unfavorable trial court rulings does not change our view of this exposure or the strength of our coverage arguments. We remain highly confident in our contract language and coverage positions. Finally, there has been some commentary about the number of lawsuits filed against The Hartford versus other industry players. We do not believe simply comparing the number of lawsuits is a useful way to assess exposure and more appropriate ways to analyze coverage defenses, limit profiles, portfolio mix, and other variables since the initial outsized wave of lawsuits against the company, the pace of new cases against The Hartford has slowed significantly and is now in line with peers. In the meantime, pending case counts against us have been reduced by approximately 25% to date through a combination of motions and withdrawals.  Turning to group benefits, core earnings were down in both the fourth quarter and full year as we experienced excess mortality rates, which we believe is attributable to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic. Obviously, mortality has been impacted by deaths directly attributable to COVID, but there is also an indirect effect which is most likely the result of patients deferring regular treatments for chronic conditions or individuals tolerating warning signs of a health problem for too long before seeking care. All cause excess mortality amounted to $152 million before tax in the quarter and included $22 million of claims related to prior quarters. The full year impact of excess mortality was $239 million, which reduced our full year core earnings margin by 3.1 points to 6.4%. In disability, our fourth quarter loss ratio was 65.1, 3.1 points higher than prior year as the fourth quarter of 2019 results included higher favorable prior year development. For the full year 2020, the loss ratio improved by 1.2 points to 66.1, benefiting from strong recoveries and, to a lesser extent, favorable incidence. On the top line, fully insured ongoing premiums were down 2% in the quarter and for the full year as our clients responded to the pandemic driven economic pressures by reducing their workforce and associated payrolls. 2020 fully insured ongoing sales driven by strong national accounts were up 11% to $717 million and persistency was slightly favorable at approximately 89%. Sales are off to a solid start in 2021 with 1/1 effective dated sales exceeding prior year by more than 10%. Looking into 2021, we expect the group benefits marketplace to remain dynamic as digital transformation, product innovation, and customer demands accelerate. Our competitive advantages and future investment road map will strengthen our market leadership.  That said, many questions still surround the pandemic and its affect on mortality and the economy; therefore, we are basing our loss picks heavily on total mortality trends in the near term rather than trying to isolate COVID-related deaths only. Based on historical mortality expectations, excluding any pandemic-related effects, we expect the core earnings margin to be between 6% and 7%. The decrease in expected margin from 2020 actual ex-COVID results primarily relates to lower expected favorable prior period development on LTD reserves and life waiver claims, and lower net investment income.  Taking into account the uncertainties surrounding the mortality impacts of the pandemic, we expect core earning margins to be reduced by 2.3 points given the continued higher rates of all cause excess mortality. Actual mortality rates will be impacted by the vaccine rollout pace, mutations of the virus, and the broader population returning to more routine medical care. In addition, we expect to a much smaller degree elevated short-term disability claims compared to historic norms. Lastly, we expect these higher mortality and short-term disability claims to impact our results predominantly in the first half of 2021. As we close the books on 2020, I am optimistic about the future. At The Hartford, underwriting human achievement is at the heart of what we do. We are committed to making a sustainable and positive impact on society as an essential element of our ongoing success. Across The Hartford, we are making this happen by always doing the right thing, fostering a workplace where everyone is welcome and respected, using our resources and influence to help mitigate the challenge of changing climate patterns, and helping to make our communities where we live and work safer and more successful, which has never been as important as it is today. Heading into 2021, I am confident in our business portfolio, people, and our strategy to deliver value for all our stakeholders. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris referenced, 2020 was an unprecedented year for the property and casualty industry and in The Hartford. The global pandemic and civil unrest losses significantly contributed to the challenges presented to our customers we serve, along with our broker and agency partners. Our employees deserve a huge thank you for their tireless efforts throughout this difficult year, tackling every obstacle that came their way. Despite the challenges, I was quite pleased with our overall performance. Property and casualty underlying margins improved by just over one point in 2020 and written premiums grew 3%. During the year, we also made substantial progress on a number of key business initiatives. In small commercial, despite COVID charges and expected margin compression from workers\u2019 compensation, we continued to outperform with another sub-90 underlying combined ratio. During the last four months of the year, new business from Spectrum, The Hartford\u2019s industry-leading package product, achieved record levels. In middle and large commercial, 2020 was the first year of our underwriting transformation journey intended to address profitability, efficiency and customer experience. Strong pricing and underwriting actions have driven improved profitability in the core book. In addition, investments in technology and data are paying off for underwriters and distribution partners. Our pace has accelerated quote turnaround time by five days, which equates to about 25%, while simultaneously improving the underwriting experience and effectiveness.  In global specialty, we\u2019re nearing two years since the Navigators acquisition close and are poised to exceed core earnings and new business goals. Underlying financial results are improving driven by exceptional pricing and book re-shaping. Continued progress to deepen relationships with retail distribution partners has delivered an additional $134 million of new premium across commercial lines that would not have been possible prior to the acquisition.  Finally on personal lines, we renewed the AARP contract through 2032 and will be launching a brand new auto product with improved digital capabilities by April. Homeowners will be launched in the summer with both products in a number of states by year end. Underlying results were extremely strong, driven largely by the pandemic\u2019s impact on driving miles while new business remains below expectations. Let me now pivot to summarize our financial performance for 2020 and then I\u2019ll conclude with some thoughts about 2021. Property and casualty core earnings were $1.7 billion for the year with a combined ratio of 96.4. This includes covered losses of $278 million or 2.3 points and current accident year catastrophe losses of $606 million or 5.1 points. Excluding COVID losses, each business reported underlying margin improvement for the year and significant improvement in the fourth quarter, much of which was driven by lower expense ratio. COVID losses in the quarter were $28 million, including $14 million for both workers\u2019 compensation and financial lines. The workers\u2019 compensation charge includes the benefit from the pandemic-related favorable frequency.  Turnings to cats, we incurred $55 million in the quarter primarily from hurricanes and convective storms, well within our expectations. Net favorable prior year development for the year was $136 million or 1.1 points. In the fourth quarter, we reported $184 million or 6.1 points of net unfavorable prior year development, which Beth will cover in her remarks.  Turning now to our business line results, the commercial lines underlying combined ratio was 95.5 for the year, improving 1.6 points from 2019 when COVID losses are excluded. The margin improvement was driven primarily by favorable non-cat property results and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by continued margin compression in small workers\u2019 compensation.  A few words on pricing. U.S. commercial lines renewal written pricing excluding workers\u2019 compensation was approximately 11% for the quarter, an excellent result and consistent with the third quarter. Middle market [indiscernible] written pricing in the U.S. excluding workers\u2019 compensation increased 10.4% for the year, nearly doubling 2019\u2019s result. In the fourth quarter, the written price increase was stable at 10.3%. Property and general liability pricing remains firm in the high single digits while auto held steady in the low double digits.  In global specialty, U.S. pricing in the quarter was a robust 19.2%, generally consistent with third quarter. The U.S. wholesale book achieved 25 points, also in line with quarter three. Excess pricing is in the mid-30s while property lines are persisting in the low 20s, and auto has moved into the mid-teens. Pricing gains in the international portfolio remained solid with improved results in marine and a very strong professional lines pricing. Small and middle market workers\u2019 compensation pricing in the quarter, while still negative, increased 60 basis points from the third quarter, driven by favorable ratings in a few states. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with how effectively our team has balanced the impact of the pandemic, account pricing, and profitability improvements in 2020. Let me share a few more details on the businesses, starting with commercial. Small commercial had another very strong year. The underlying combined ratio was 89.2 for the year, one point better than prior year when COVID losses are excluded. Lower non-cat property losses and a favorable expense ratio were partially offset by workers\u2019 compensation margin compression. Total small commercial written premium declined 3% for the year. After a challenging second quarter due to the economic shutdown, written premium in the last six months was essentially flat to prior year. In the fourth quarter, new business results were strong and policy retention returned to historical levels. Our premium retention in the second half of the year was unfavorably impacted by lower premium audits and endorsements of approximately four to five points due to lower payrolls. Fourth quarter new business of $153 million was up 11% versus prior year. Our Spectrum product is driving this growth and I\u2019m very encouraged by the improved business momentum. Moving to middle and large commercial, we posted and underlying combined ratio of 100.9 for the year, 2.5 points better than prior year after excluding COVID losses. A favorable expense ratio and lower non-cat property losses drove the margin improvement. Total written premium declined by 3% for the full year. New business in middle market was down 18% versus 2019; however, new business premium in the fourth quarter was up 2%. Quotes, quote ratio and hit ratio in the guaranteed cost book for the fourth quarter were all better than 2019 levels. 2020 premium retention declined seven points versus 2019 driven by underwriting actions and lower exposures in workers\u2019 compensation. Through this underwriting discipline, we start 2021 with much improved financial performance.  In global specialty, the underlying combined ratio was 98.3 for the full year, 2.5 points better than prior year after excluding COVID losses. We continue to be pleased with the margin expansion in global specialty. Excluding the impact of COVID, we\u2019ve seen approximately five points of improvement from the second half of 2019, almost entirely coming from the Navigators book with particularly strong results in U.S. wholesale and global reinsurance, combined with a lower expense ratio.  Global specialty written premium for the fourth quarter was up 9% versus prior year. Top line growth was driven by significant favorable pricing partially offset by slightly lower new business levels and lower retentions, primarily in the international book due to our portfolio re-shaping and underwriting actions. Shifting over to personal lines, written premiums declined 6% for the year, 4% when adjusting for the second quarter refund. Although new business levels were below expectation, auto new business was up slightly versus prior year. Lower responses were offset by a better conversion rate. We\u2019re excited about the launch of our new auto product in April with the country-wide rollout of both auto and home to occur over the next two years.  Despite lower growth, underwriting results in 2020 were particularly strong. In personal lines auto, the underlying combined ratio of 88 was 9.9 points better than 2019. Consistent with the industry, frequency ran well below prior year. During the fourth quarter, reduced frequency remained fairly stable with third quarter results. In home, the underlying combined ratio for the year of 72.5 was 5.8 points better than prior year, driven predominantly by favorable non-cat weather.  Before I turn things over to Beth, I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts about 2021. We project a 2021 commercial lines underlying combined ratio between 90 and 92. This includes a COVID loss estimate of 1.5 points. The COVID estimate is approximately two-thirds workers\u2019 compensation and one-third specialty lines. Ex-COVID, we expect our 2021 underlying combined ratio at its midpoint to improve nearly three points from 2020. Renewal written pricing in middle market is forecasted to remain strong during 2021 and largely consistent with 2020 across most lines. We foresee global specialty renewal written rate increases to remain in the double digits. Workers\u2019 compensation pricing is projected to be largely consistent with 2020. In personal lines, we expect driving miles to increase as the vaccine rolls out, particularly for our AARP book, contributing to an underlying combined ratio of 87 to 89.  Reflecting back on 2020, in spite of all the challenges we faced, financial results were quite strong for our property and casualty business units. We delivered year-over-year ex-COVID margin improvement through disciplined underwriting, significant portfolio re-shaping, and the start of Hartford Next in every business. Given the incredible challenges of 2020, I\u2019m extremely encouraged by the improving underwriting performance. With underwriting actions largely behind us, we are now well positioned to improve our margins and pivot toward growth. Our team is energized for the future and confident that we have the talent, tools and teamwork to deliver. I look forward to updating you all on progress throughout the year. Let me now turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you Doug. I\u2019m going to cover results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds and corporate, provide an update on our capital management plans, and discuss P&C prior year accident year development, including the results of our annual A&E study.  Net investment income was $556 million for the quarter, up 11% from the prior year quarter. For the year, net investment income was $1.8 billion, down 5% from 2019 due to lower reinvestment rates and lower yields on floating rate securities, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets due in part to the acquisition of Navigators.  The total portfolio yield for the full year was 3.6% compared to 4.1% in 2019. During the year, the average reinvestment rate was 2.5% compared with a sales and maturity yield of 3.4%. The annualized limited partnership return was 32% for the fourth quarter driven by higher private equity valuations and distributions and the sale of two underlying real estate properties, resulting in LP income of $152 million before tax in the quarter. For the year, the LP yield was 12.3%.  Overall, the credit performance of our investment portfolio remains very strong. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities after tax increased to $2.8 billion at December 31 from $2.4 billion at September 30. Unrealized and realized gains on equity securities was a gain of $55 million before tax in the quarter. Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings for the quarter was $46 million, up 15% from the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in fee income and lower administrative expenses, including a reduction in state income taxes and travel expenses. The increase in fee income, which was largely attributable to higher daily average Hartford Fund AUM was partially offset by a continued shift to lower fee-generating funds.  Full year core earnings were up 12% due to higher daily average assets and lower expenses, including a first quarter reduction in consideration related to the Lattice transaction of $12 million before tax. Long term fund performance remains strong with two-thirds of funds beating peers on a five-year basis. The corporate core loss was $51 million for the quarter and $178 million for the year. For the fourth quarter, the core loss was higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of the company\u2019s investment in Talcott Resolution. For the quarter, we recorded a $1 million pre-tax loss from Talcott compared to $21 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2019.  On January 20, the consortium that owns Talcott announced it was being sold to a new group of investors. We will receive 9.7% of the proceeds and any pre-closing dividends. We are very pleased with how this investment has performed, and since we have been recording Talcott\u2019s results on the equity method, we do not expect significant impacts to net income on closing. In the quarter, we continued to execute on our Hartford Next initiative. For the second half of 2020, we recognized savings before program costs of $106 million and we have increased our estimate of 2021 savings to $350 million as we have been able to accelerate some of our initiatives. Overall, we are on track to achieve annual operating expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2022, reducing the P&C expense ratio by 2 to 2.5 points, the group benefits expense ratio by 1.5 to 2 points, and the claim expense ratio by approximately 0.5 points as compared to 2019 results. As Doug mentioned, we recognized net prior year reserve strengthening of $184 million before tax in the fourth quarter, which included several items. First, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve review. Before cession to the adverse development cover we have in place, net reserves increased by $218 million, comprised of $127 million for asbestos liabilities and $91 million for environmental. The $127 million increase in asbestos reserves was primarily due to an increase in the rate of asbestos claim settlements as well as higher than previously estimated average settlement values and defense costs. Overall, the number of asbestos claims filings in the period covered by the 2020 study was roughly flat with the 2019 study. The $91 million increase in environmental reserve was primarily due to an increasing number of PFAS claims as well as higher remediation and legal defense costs. Since the completion of the A&E study brought the cumulative losses ceded to the ADC to an amount in excess of the $650 million of ceded premium paid, the company recognized a non-core earnings charge of $210 million, representing a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance. The cumulative losses ceded to the A&E ADC are currently $860 million, leaving $640 million of limit remaining. Cession to the Navigators adverse development cover were $5 million in the fourth quarter with $91 million of limit remaining. In the quarter, we increased reserve associated with sexual moral station by $125 million which was related to claims asserted against the Boy Scouts of America. Offsetting these reserve increases was favorable development for prior year catastrophes of $116 million primarily related to accident years 2017 to 2019, as well as favorable development in workers\u2019 compensation and package business. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI rose 8% for the year to $47.16, and our 2020 core earnings ROE was 12.7%. We ended 2020 with a debt and preferred stock capitalization ratio ex-AOCI of 21.6%. Our goal is to keep debt leverage within the low to mid 20% range.  Turning to capital, as of December 31, holding company resources totaled $1.8 billion. As we look at 2021, we expect dividends from the operating company to total $850 million to $900 million for P&C, $250 million to $295 million for group benefits, and $125 million to $150 million for Hartford Funds. Yesterday, we announced an 8% increase in our common quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share. In December, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion effective January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022. Although we have not had any repurchase activity to date, our expectation is to resume repurchases over the remaining weeks of this quarter.  To wrap up, our businesses performed strongly in a challenging year. We are pleased to see the benefit of our initiatives coming through in our results. As we manage the pandemic and continue to execute across all of our businesses, we will generate further improvement in our results and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Susan so we can begin the Q&A session. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, could you have the first question? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Elyse Greenspan : Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on your guidance for 2021 for commercial P&C. Within that three points of underlying margin improvement ex-COVID, could we get a sense of what\u2019s embedded in there stemming from a loss versus the expense ratio? Then also, are you assuming that margins will stand within small, middle, large, and also within specialty in 2021? Doug Elliot : Elyse, let me tackle that question. The first point relative to the three points, roughly two-thirds of that is coming through the loss area, so yes there\u2019s Hartford Next benefit in there - it\u2019s about 0.8 points. Second component is that primarily the loss improvement is coming from middle market and global specialty, so our businesses that have been leveraged by the portfolio re-shaping and the heavy pricing are driving disproportionate amounts of that increase year-over-year.  Small commercial is still very, very profitable, but they will feel a challenging workers\u2019 comp environment again in \u201921, and we\u2019ve balanced that as we\u2019ve put the complete plan together. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, and then as you\u2019ve thought about 2020, is there any--it seems like there was some non-cat weather, but for the most part it neutralized, so we\u2019re just kind of thinking about the loss ratio improvement that you mentioned, the two-thirds primarily coming from the rate exceeding loss trends within the middle and specialty book? Doug Elliot : That\u2019s correct, yes. It was a pretty good property non-cat year for us, and I would say that some of the compares had higher levels of that non-cat weather activity in 2019, so that drives some of the quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year change, Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. Then my second question is on the capital side of things. You guys put in a $1.5 billion buyback program in December. Obviously, you said you\u2019ll be back in the market after earnings starting to buy back your stock, but how do we think about that between the two years? Is it market dependent? I know you gave us dividend up from the sub this year, but would you expect that to be even over the two years or is there something else that we should -- when you kind of work towards that buyback program? Chris Swift : Elyse, it\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll let Beth add her point of view, but generally we\u2019ve been proportional, pro rata with a lot of our buyback programs over a multiple year period of time, so philosophically I don\u2019t see much different. Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes, I would agree with that. I think to have you think about it being half and half between the two years is a reasonable expectation. Again, it\u2019s dependent on a lot of factors and market conditions but going into how we think about executing a plan like that, that\u2019s how I\u2019d have you think about it. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. First question here for Chris and Doug, I\u2019m just curious, as I look at your guidance for commercial lines underlying, what is your assumption with respect to the headwind from workers\u2019 comp margins in 2021? On that topic too, what do you think is going to happen with loss cost trends for workers\u2019 comp as the economy reopens? Doug Elliot : Well, it\u2019s a big question, Brian. First off on the pricing side, as I mentioned in my script, we expect the 2021 year to look largely consistent with 2020 from a pricing perspective. Yes, we\u2019re seeing a bottoming of the workers\u2019 comp curve, but I still expect some downward pressure minus pressure in small commercial and middle market flat to maybe up a point or two, so that\u2019s the pricing side of it. The loss trend piece is very complicated, and we\u2019re not going to go through a roll forward for everybody today; but essentially the 2020 year looks so unlike any year we\u2019ve ever had before because of the pandemic, so as we complete 2020, obviously frequency has been in very good shape and you\u2019ve seen that come through our adjustments, but the flipside is we\u2019re watching carefully severity, and so we\u2019re watching durations, we\u2019re watching medical treatment, we\u2019re watching the extended impacts of what may or may not happen with COVID victims, so we\u2019re being careful with severity.  We\u2019ve moved our picks up a little bit in the 2020 accident year, we\u2019ve kept them there for \u201921, but again when we look through workers\u2019 comp, we look through these two years, we\u2019re still on our long term picks. We think over time this aligns, it should run at five on the severity side and flattish for frequency, based on everything we see in the next few years. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks. The second question is--I\u2019m just curious, on your guidance with respect to COVID losses, particularly on the GB side, how should we think about the timing of that coming through? I would think that first quarter, much higher particularly for the GB and then just dissipating during the course of the year. Is that kind of the way we should think about things? Chris Swift : Brian, I tried to say that in my prepared remarks, maybe it wasn\u2019t clear, but yes. Of the $160 million of life COVID losses, I\u2019d say 75% would be a good number for first quarter. Brian Meredith : Okay, and what about with respect to the commercial lines? Doug Elliot : Yes, heavy first half. It depends on vaccines and rollouts, but yes I think we expect first quarter to look similar to probably fourth quarter, and then our hopes and optimism are shared across the country that second quarter and third quarter improve mightily. Brian Meredith : Terrific, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. Ryan Tunis : Yes, thanks. I guess just a follow-up on the capital management. We\u2019ve seen, given the fact that you didn\u2019t manage much capital in 2020 and the dividend capabilities of these businesses over the next couple years that you\u2019ll be generating, I guess, well in excess of--or you\u2019ll have available a lot more than what\u2019s in place for the buyback and common divi\u2019s, so I guess maybe if you could comment on are you thinking about doing any M&A or what you might be using other excess capital for? Chris Swift : Ryan, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Beth again add her color. We feel very fortunate to be sitting on excess capital that obviously we\u2019re planning to return to shareholders vis-\u00e0-vis a dividend increase that you just saw, and then obviously our buyback program. Our priorities for capital are really consistent, right - we want to use capital to grow our businesses, and we do see good growth opportunities going forward, and then make sure we have a financially solid balance sheet with sufficient margins to absorb any future shocks that obviously we\u2019re living through these days, and then we think about returning excess vis-\u00e0-vis share buyback to shareholders from there.  I think I\u2019ve said before M&A is a lower priority for us right now. I think in my language, we have everything we need to compete in the building these days, and it\u2019s maturing, it\u2019s growing, it\u2019s working with our distribution partners to make sure they know all our capabilities, so M&A is a low priority right now. Beth, would you add anything? Beth Costello : No, I think you\u2019ve covered it very, very well. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. Then a follow-up for Beth, it sounds like lower net investment income is captured in the group benefits guide, but how are you thinking about the portfolio yield headwind on the P&C side in terms of how we should be thinking about NII next year there? Beth Costello : A couple things. Obviously one of the things that\u2019s included in the group benefits margin guidance is a more normal or more normal planning assumption for limited partnerships, and obviously this year we were well above that. If you think about the portfolio ex-partnerships and you look at where we were Q4 with a portfolio yield of about 3.2% overall, I see probably 10 points of pressure on that as we look forward into 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. First, just had a question on workers\u2019 comp pricing, and I think Doug, you mentioned you\u2019re expecting it to be consistent with last year. Are you seeing that in the market actually, or is that just more of the hope right now? Some more color on workers\u2019 comp. Doug Elliot : I would separate the markets. As I think about small commercial, largely a file with little deviation, and we\u2019re seeing flat to negative pricing. I think the file trends across the bureau state next year are off four to five points, so I think that environment will continue to exist as it has in the last couple years, although slightly improved negative, right? We were probably eight or nine off two and three years ago, and now we\u2019re half off, so that\u2019s encouraging. In the middle market space, we see a very competitive marketplace. It\u2019s remained competitive over the last 12, 15 months, and I think we\u2019ll continue to battle it out account by account. We\u2019re thoughtful about accounts. We think about our tools. We look at the accounts straight up and we make decisions, so I don\u2019t see a lot of change in that middle market workers\u2019 comp environment going forward, at least in the next year. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay, and what was the impetus for the reserve increase for molestation claims? Chris Swift : Jimmy, what I would say is, as we talked about in the past, sexual molestation claims, reviver statutes, they all go together here, particularly in this quarter, as Beth mentioned, related to Boy Scouts. They\u2019re in bankruptcy, trying to reorganize, and the amount of additional claims that were reported to us this past November far exceeded our initial expectations. Now, we\u2019re really sympathetic to the real victims here, but there are some serious questions about the validity of all the claims that were reported. Nevertheless, we felt it prudent, again just given the magnitude, to increase our reserve position, and we did. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay, and then just lastly on business interruption losses, obviously in the U.S. for the most part, the courts are siding with insurers, not so in international markets, so is your view on your exposure consistent in Europe as well, or in the U.K. market, or do you think you might actually have a little bit more risk there? Chris Swift : Yes, I would say in the U.S. first, you heard my prepared remarks - you know, we\u2019re debating and fighting out in the courts and litigating, so nothing fundamentally has changed our views on BI exposures. We have not put up any reserves other than for our policies that did not have direct physical loss requirement. Our expense reserves remain the same - I mean, we\u2019re spending money to defend ourselves, which is why we\u2019ve put it up. I would say the U.K. judgment doesn\u2019t affect us at all here in the U.S., as you know, and does not impact us in any way in our Lloyd\u2019s syndicate, which is--we didn\u2019t participate in those types of policies. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning, thanks. Thinking about--probably for Beth, we saw the sale of Talcott was announced. Can you remind us how much capital Hartford has remaining, and also maybe can you remind us, do you expect to--does Hartford expect to get any kind of cash tax benefits from any remaining DTAs or AMTs? Beth Costello : Yes, so I\u2019ll take it in two pieces. As it relates to the Talcott investment overall, kind of on an ex-AOCI basis, it\u2019s about $185 million on our balance sheet, and again it\u2019s an investment so like all of our investments, they\u2019re part of our capital base. I wouldn\u2019t have you think about this as creating excess capital capacity - there\u2019s obviously some risk charges that would go away, but it\u2019s all part of our capital base.  Then as it relates to DTAs and AMT tax credits, we have monetized all of those through 2020, so we are really in a position now where we\u2019re a normal taxpayer and very pleased to have been able to recoup all of those balances. Mike Zaremski : Okay, excellent. One follow-up - Chris, in your prepared remarks, I think that was a great statistic about approximately 25% decline in business interruption-related case counts. I\u2019m just curious, since we get a lot of questions on this tail risk topic, do you think directionally that\u2019s also the trend for the industry and that plaintiffs are seeing that the policy wording is strong? Chris Swift : Yes, I can\u2019t speak to the 25% for the rest of the industry. Obviously that\u2019s our statistics, but I think anecdotally you could tell many of the judgments coming out of federal and state court are aligned with the industry\u2019s position on interpreting the language of direct physical loss or damage. As we sit here today, I feel pretty good about where all the judgments are coming out, so that\u2019s what I would share, Mike. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. I had a follow-up question for Beth, just on the capital side and remittance guidance that you gave. On the P&C side, it seems that that\u2019s stable with prior years, but if I look at the earnings power of the P&C business, it looks like it\u2019s up 40% since you last changed it, so I\u2019m wondering why the remittances haven\u2019t moved much since 2018. Beth Costello : Great question. Again, I think you now our philosophy is to be in a position where we\u2019re taking steady dividends out of the subsidiaries. You\u2019re right - if you look at 2018, but if you also look back to 2016 and 2017, the amount of dividends that we were taking out were far exceeding our statutory earnings, so on balance I think where we are, 900 is very comfortable. I think to the extent that we continue to generate earnings at the level that we\u2019re at, that there\u2019s opportunity for that to increase, but we tend to be pretty steady as we think about our dividends out of our subsidiaries. David Motemaden : Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. Then a question for Chris and Doug, just on the outlook. I\u2019m thinking a bit more from a top line perspective. Just thinking about how you guys are expecting top line in commercial P&C specifically as we progress throughout the course of 2021, what you guys are thinking for growth there, and maybe Doug, if you can just talk a little bit more about the Spectrum policy, because that seems like that had some really good new business trends this quarter. Chris Swift : Yes David, I\u2019ll start and then Doug will provide his color. I think the first starting point is just the macro, that we\u2019re still living in a pandemic, right, and we\u2019ve only vaccinated, what, 10% of our population, so the first half of \u201921 and the second half of \u201921 could look, I would say dramatically different. Second point is I think you\u2019ve always heard us talk that we\u2019re a fairly employment-centric firm with our large comp book and our large disability book, so as employment levels rise, and we were encouraged to see the employment numbers this morning obviously come down, we\u2019ll have to digest really what that means from an absolute number of workers, but again heading in the right direction to sort of rebuild payrolls, which obviously then provides a lift from there.  Third, I would say--again, hopefully you could feel it through Doug and myself that we are optimistic about what we can achieve in the marketplace with our expanded product capabilities, our new industry verticals in an environment where rates are going to continue, I think, at the pace they are, at least for the next 12 to 18 months. You put all that together, and I\u2019m refraining from giving you an exact number so don\u2019t ask for an exact number, but I think it points to an increasing top line, Doug, compared to what we\u2019ve experienced over prior years. Doug Elliot : Yes, I would just add that on the Spectrum question, we launched a terrific, very contemporary product right at the end of 2019. We\u2019re feeling terrific about the prospects of that, and we barely get in market and COVID hits in March, so you\u2019ve really got to take that five or six month period out where we know that sales were off quite substantially in second quarter. I am deeply encouraged by what happened the last four months of the year. I think it\u2019s a terrific product, I think the ease of use, the reaction from CSRs and customers around the country is exactly what we wanted, and I think that holds prospects for growth going forward. Again, in light of the economy turning back on, that will be a big condition for us in small, but I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re headed in a really good direction.  Lastly, relative to global specialty and middle and large commercial, we had some significant activities on the underwriting side that needed to happen this year to get back where we wanted to be, a profit turnaround if you will, and I feel really good about those actions that were taken. As I pivot into \u201921, I think largely many of those actions are behind us, not all but many, the large block of that, and so I\u2019m encouraged that there\u2019s opportunity for growth and I feel really good about our verticals. I love what the Navigator breadth has meant to our franchise, and we\u2019re just beginning to explore, I think, the full dynamic of that, so I\u2019m bullish about what we\u2019re going to do heading forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you, good morning. If we could unpack a bit your underlying combined ratio improvement expectations that are included in your 2021 outlook, based on your commentary and others, the driver of rate increases is to get ahead of loss trends, and you\u2019ve cited social inflation. Could you provide some color of the direction of your current year loss picks and couple that with the rate increases you\u2019re expecting to achieve? Doug Elliot : Let\u2019s start with what we\u2019ve said in the past, which is with the exception of workers\u2019 compensation, all of the rest of our lines in commercial are exceeding our loss cost trends. I think that still holds, and as such the work and the pricing activity on a written basis that we achieved this year, plus what we expect next year, leads us to believe on an earned basis, we\u2019re going to see earned improvement in our loss ratios across commercial for all lines, ex-workers\u2019 comp. I expect some margin compression in small just as we battle through in 2020, but the aggregate of what we\u2019ve been able to achieve in global specialty and middle market pricing leads me to feel confident that the driver of loss ratio change in those two businesses will carry the incremental improvement that we express in our guidance for \u201921. Personal lines is a different story, right? We had a very positive low-driving mile year period - nine months, if you will, and we expect those driving miles to return back more to normal, so the personal lines margin and loss ratio will come back toward a more normal level, and that\u2019s why you see the pick that we\u2019ve selected here for \u201921. If you put personal and commercial together, overall we\u2019re still encouraged and feel improvement, but there are mix stories inside that you just have to be aware of. Tracy Benguigui : Okay, thank you. You\u2019ve already provided some good color and workers\u2019 comp and by segment. I\u2019m wondering if you could highlight any other business line where you\u2019re seeing more rate increases. Doug Elliot : Tracy, certainly in our specialty businesses, as demonstrated by the numbers, terrific progress - you know, near 20 on the quarter, and across certain lines excellent progress. I do think when I look at property, I\u2019m very pleased about property. We have been working on our property book on a bi-parallel [ph] pricing basis now for a couple of years, but I\u2019m encouraged that our ENS property book was in the low 20s, our large property book, which is not included in the calc in the supplement, was in the low 20s. Our core middle market, smaller property book, high-high single digits, so I\u2019m very encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making line by line and feel like that sets up for an improving story in \u201921, which we share with you in our optimistic guidance. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you for taking my questions. Doug Elliot : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead with your question Meyer Shields : Great, thanks. A question for Doug. I was hoping you could share within, I guess at least Navigators, your appetite for really, really large accounts. We\u2019re hearing obviously that\u2019s where pricing is most dramatic. I just wanted to get a sense of how much of that you\u2019re interested in or willing to underwrite. Doug Elliot : Meyer, our portfolio appetite now extends across the segments, right, so we obviously have a strong position in small, growing strength in middle with verticals, a really solid national account franchise primarily around workers\u2019 compensation, and an assortment of specialty products that Vince and his team attack both large accounts, middle market accounts, etc., terrific wholesale distribution - that is an added element of the Navigators acquisition, so I feel like we\u2019re coming at the market in all phases, all products, all segments, all geographies, and I really like that approach. As I suggested in my remarks, we\u2019ve had some nice early wins that I think will just be the beginning of how we mature this broad product breadth into our family of what we bring to market. Chris Swift : Meyer, I would say again, like a lot of things we do around here, we\u2019re centered on small, middle market enterprises. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t service and find opportunities in the larger segment of the market, but I would have you leave with that most of our property capabilities are geared towards middle and upper middle market, and the multi-billion dollar property schedules, we might have opportunities to participate but--again, think in terms of core middle market to upper middle market is where we like to focus and try to win business. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. A follow-up to--well, not a follow-up, an unrelated question for Beth. You\u2019ve got really, really strong limited partnership results, but do you have the flexibility to say, okay, let\u2019s cash out here, or is the proportionate commitment with in the investment portfolio something we should think of as being unchanged? Beth Costello : As we invest in these partnerships, we do obviously still have outstanding commitments that are there, and we see this as an asset class that we want to continue to participate in. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the overall returns there and how our investment team has managed that, so I wouldn\u2019t have you think about us trying to cash out. In many instances, you\u2019re pretty limited in your ability to do that based on how these partnerships are structured. Meyer Shields : Okay, but it\u2019s fair to assume, let me take it from the other side, that the expected returns will still apply to the higher value at year-end? Beth Costello : Our expectation over time is that we think that the yields that we outlook to is what one would see - starting to see outsized returns on some of the more seasoned portfolios, and then as we\u2019re investing in new funds, those would tend to draw in a lower yield originally. You kind of think about the balance of the two, but again you can look at our results over time, our partnerships have performed very strongly, but we typically look at them over the long term, at that sort of 6% level. Meyer Shields : Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Yaron Kinar : Hi, good morning everybody. My first question just goes back to the group benefits and the mortality there. Considering that it\u2019s a younger block from an age perspective, can you maybe talk a little bit about what concentration you may be seeing there by age cohort, by region, by maybe line of industry, from where you\u2019re seeing these elevated mortality rates? I guess I was just a little surprised to see this level of mortality from an active employee force. Chris Swift : Yes, I would share with you, Yaron, that mortality increase is fairly consistent amongst all age cohorts. Obviously the rate of mortality is different by age cohort, but the increase is fairly consistent. I would also share with you about 6% or 7% of our insured population is 60 and older, so we don\u2019t have a big concentration in, I\u2019ll call it the mature segment of the marketplace, so the direct to indirect effect of COVID is pretty spread across all cohorts, all regions of the country. We\u2019re not seeing any particular trend at this point in time other than the indirect cause, as we try to analyze it, we just think it\u2019s people deferring and not taking care of themselves during the pandemic, and we see heart disease, stroke and cancer deaths up - again, not directly related to COVID but indirectly related. Yaron Kinar : Got it, that\u2019s helpful color. Then I think you saw very limited utilization of the Navigator ADC this quarter, so do you think you\u2019ve gotten reserves there to the conservative levels you want them to be at, you\u2019ve kind of turned the corner? Any thoughts on that? Chris Swift : Yes, again I\u2019d just go back to what we\u2019ve said before. Glad we purchased it, it was part of our strategy as we thought about financing the overall Navigators transaction. Obviously it slowed down this quarter, but you know in this business, you can never predict with certainty what\u2019s going to happen in the future with some of these claims. But the excess level that we have or ht sufficiency remaining in it gives me a great deal of confidence that it\u2019s not going to go through the top, bottom line. Yaron Kinar : Got it, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to Ms. Spivak Bernstein for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you. We really appreciate all of you joining us today. If we did not get to your question, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us and we\u2019ll be happy to answer any follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Susan Spivak. Please go ahead. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Ian. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on first quarter 2021 earnings. This morning we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our website. Chris Swift : Thank you for joining us this morning. I want to start by saying that I have never been more excited about the future of The Hartford. In the first quarter, there were infrequent items that impacted reported results. However, the underlying performance of our business continues to reflect strong execution on key initiatives and improving margins. I am extremely bullish about the prospects of growth and further margin expansion in the second half of 2021 and in 2022. The current macroeconomic environment and industry outlook favors The Hartford and combined with the strength of our businesses we are positioned to deliver accelerated growth and attractive returns for our shareholders. I'm now going to turn the call over to Doug and Beth, so they can provide some more commentary on the quarter. After their remarks, I will provide more details on our financial targets that we disclosed here today. So, with that, Beth I'll turn the call over to you. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Earlier today, we reported first quarter core earnings of $203 million or $0.56 per diluted share. Core earnings were down 58% in the quarter primarily due to the impact of three significant items. Doug Elliot : Thanks Beth. Over the past few years, I've shared a series of priorities providing updates along the way. To summarize we have been increasing the breadth and depth of our product offerings, reshaping our portfolio and investing in new capabilities for the benefit of customers, distribution partners and our underwriters. The success of those efforts supported by a firm ex-workers' compensation pricing environment is producing consistent ex-COVID underlying margin expansion including 4.3 points in quarter 1. The global pandemic certainly interrupted the potential for top line momentum in 2020 creating an important inflection point for 2021. First quarter Property & Casualty written premium grew 2% driven by a strong Commercial Lines result of 4%. I'm pleased with our underlying first quarter results and what it portends for the rest of the year. I'll start with a few headlines before diving deeper into the micro story. The P&C underlying combined ratio of 89.4% was outstanding. Commercial Lines produced a stellar ex COVID underlying combined ratio of 90.1% and Personal Lines contributed with an underlying combined ratio of 83.5%. Small Commercial new business grew 12% during the first three months contributing to our largest premium quarter ever. Spectrum's momentum continued with new written premium growth of 32% a record new business level beating quarter four of 2020. April new business in Small Commercial also look strong and we are encouraged by the tailwinds of increasing new business formations. According to the US Census new business applications were up 62% in the first quarter. Global Specialty written premium increased 13% including new business growth of 10%. With underwriting actions largely behind us, retention has improved across the board. In the quarter the breadth of our growth was very strong led by 18% in wholesale, 13% in US financial lines and 29% in international. Global Re also had an excellent quarter with gross written premium growth of 12%. Across the franchise cross-sell activities have been robust outperforming our original deal expectations. Cross-sell premium between Global Specialty and Middle Market business drove $23 million of new business in the first quarter and $157 million of new business since the Navigators acquisition. This success has been fueled by our now broadened specialty capabilities, as well as deepened relationships with retail brokers. Over the last 18 months we have added nearly 1200 product lines and over 250 accounts for our customers that span both Middle Market and Global Specialty books. Chris Swift : Thank you, Doug and Beth. The iconic Hartford brand was created over more than 200 years ago. It is a durable source of competitive advantage, and a symbol of strength and confidence. Almost a decade ago, we initiated a strategic plan, which focused on two key goals. First, to divest low-ROE market-sensitive and capital-intensive individual life insurance and variable annuity businesses, second, to focus on businesses where our market leadership position and long-term sustainable competitive advantages would generate profitable growth and superior returns. The first culminated with the sale of Talcott Resolution, in 2018. The second goal was amplified by the 2017 acquisition of Aetna's Group Benefits business, which made us the number two player based on, in-force premium. Then, the 2019 acquisition of Navigators enhanced our product depth and breadth across Commercial Lines and added new wholesale distribution. Fast-forward to today, The Hartford is an industry leader with a diverse platform of complementary businesses, producing industry-leading results. As we move forward, we will leverage our capabilities and focus, as we remain relentless in the pursuit of profitable growth. As evidence of our success, from 2018 to 2020 EPS grew 16%, book value per diluted share grew 20%. And we produced an average return on equity of 13% more than 300 basis points above the peer average. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are confident that several macroeconomic factors will provide meaningful tailwinds, positioning our business for accelerated growth, and improved returns. First, the emergence from the pandemic is expected to reduce excess mortality in our group life business, and worker compensation losses in Commercial Lines. Secondly, rapidly improving expectations for unemployment, which could be below 5% by the end of this year and GDP growth in the mid-to-high single-digits is expected to drive top line growth in our employment-centric workers' compensation, and Group Benefits businesses. An improving economy will become an additional catalyst of growth across our small commercial segment. Third, as the underwriting environment remains constructive, P&C commercial renewal pricing is expected to remain strong, thereby, expanding margins. Finally, rising interest rates is anticipated to provide an incremental benefit to investment portfolio yields. This is a favorable macroeconomic environment for The Hartford to operate and compete in over the next couple years. In commercial lines, we expect top line growth to benefit from strong pricing, rising exposures due to the economic expansion and investments in digital capabilities. We also anticipate that reduced operating expenses will continue to drive margin expansion across all our businesses. We are the market leader in small commercial a highly sought-after market segment. We consistently generate sub-90s underlying combined ratios, which benefit from strong distribution, best-in-class products, efficient technology that eases the underwriting process for our agents and customers. New business sales from the recent launch of next-gen Spectrum product have been building momentum since the third quarter of 2020, generating a record level of sales this quarter. We are highly encouraged by our performance in this segment and new business growth potential. In middle and large commercial, we expect growth to benefit from continued firm pricing, cross-selling from an expanded product set stemming from the Navigators acquisition, positive traction across specialized industry verticals and technology investments. I'm particularly pleased with the cross-sell success that Doug referenced along with enhanced underwriting tools and capabilities. In global specialty, the business continues to benefit from the robust pricing environment, improving margins and retail cross-selling opportunities across standard commercial lines accounts. This quarter, global specialty produced written premium growth of 13% and the underlying combined ratio was below 90%. The Navigators acquisition is and will continue to be pivotal in driving growth and underwriting profits. In personal lines, growth is expected to be driven by the launch of the new auto and homeowners products, improved underwriting efficiencies and a new cloud-based technology. Personal lines margins in 2020 were certainly helped by less miles driven during the pandemic. And as driving returns to more normal levels, we expect to deliver profitable growth enhanced by operating and expense efficiencies. In our group benefits business, we anticipate growth to be driven by higher employment levels, strong new sales and growth in voluntary and A&H products. This business post-pandemic is expected to produce strong core earnings margins with a more stable mortality trends beginning in the second half of 2021. Across each of our businesses, improving operating efficiencies and a lower expense ratio from the Hartford Next program is a critical driver of margin expansion. In the second quarter of 2020, we detailed plans to achieve $500 million of savings by 2022. To date the program has delivered $233 million of savings. Based on the program's success to date, we are increasing our pre-tax savings to approximately $540 million in 2022 and estimating in total $625 million of savings in 2023. With the expectations for strong financial performance and capital generation driven in part by the improving macroeconomic environment, we have increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Our expectation for 2021 is to repurchase $1.5 billion and the remaining balance in 2022. With top-line growth across the business, strong earned pricing trends in excess of loss cost, operating efficiencies, a reduced COVID impact and continued capital management, we are targeting a core earnings ROE of approximately 13% to 14% in 2022 and into 2023. This ROE plan positions us to meaningfully outperform our peers. Before turning the call over to Q&A, let me address the unsolicited bids we have received from Chubb. Chubb delivered two additional letters to The Hartford since we announced the rejection of their $65 proposal back on March 23. The most recent letter outlined an offer of $70 per share in cash and stock. We have disclosed letters in our Form 8-K filing today. The Board reviewed each letter in consultation with its financial and legal advisers and unanimously rejected each proposal and concluded that engaging in discussions regarding a strategic transaction is not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Board has reaffirmed its confidence and conviction in the continued execution of The Hartford strategic business plan. As a result, The Hartford is singularly focused on executing against its goals and objectives and I will not comment further on the Chubb matter. As I said from the outset of my remarks I'm extremely excited about the future of The Hartford and incredibly optimistic. We remain highly confident in our stand-alone plan. The Hartford franchise has never been better positioned to succeed and thrive. We expect to continue to deliver industry-leading financial performance, while creating value for all our stakeholders. With that I'll turn the call over to Susan to begin the Q&A. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Chris. We have time now to take your questions. Operator, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question? Operator :  And our first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please proceed. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. So, I guess, aside the Chubb offers your public posture has shifted. And Chris you're -- I was watching or listening to your comments and reading your presentation. Can you give us some -- give us a sense of maybe what has shifted or what's changed just in the last couple months that give you the confidence to come out with these higher ROE targets as we think about 2022 and 2023? Chris Swift : Sure, Greg, happy to. I think when we built our plan basically in the fourth quarter of 2020 I mean we were still in the midst of I thought the worst of the pandemic. If you look at mortality trends they were increasing. If you look at, sort of, just the macro environment it just was a time to still be a little cautious. But as we got into 2021 and particularly after we completed the first quarter we just felt it was appropriate to rethink the future and disclose what we disclosed today, which I think is very positive news. It's more of a growth story obviously. It's a margin expansion story coming out of a continued P&C pricing environment. It's an efficiency and expense story. And you put it all together particularly with the excess capital that we have it really turns out to be a very robust ROE story. And we wanted to tell investors here in the first quarter. Greg Peters : Got it. And it makes sense. Yes, I'd like to pivot to slide 6 of your investor slide deck where you talk about the Commercial Lines results. And Doug, I know, you were talking a lot about price trends. And I was looking at the rate increase chart. And one of the comments you made is that some of the lines have approached rate adequacy. Can you give us more color on what's going on in the different segments as it relates to price, especially, in the context of loss cost trends? Doug Elliot : Sure. So as, I think, about our markets and I know, you know, this much of the pricing activity that has occurred in a positive way over the last couple years sits in the Middle Market and the specialty franchises. So we'll start with specialty. If you think about some of the products that we deliver to the market, we've seen quite strong pricing now moving into a third renewal. And at some point, as you work your way through those pricing trends, even from points that needed quite a bit of pricing, we feel like we're in a much better state. Loss trends, we're still staying on top of loss trends. But if you think about the specialty lines, we just look across that portfolio given our pricing and re-underwriting actions I think you have to look at them in a combination sense. We feel very good about our selections and just see strong ROE and strong margin performance that has improved over the last couple years. The same is largely true in Middle and Large Commercial. If you go back and look at our trends that we've shared particularly ex workers' comp pricing, a strong run over five or six quarters, coupled with our underwriting actions that book is much more rate-adequate today across sectors, across geographies. And we feel good as we look into the latter half of 2021 into 2022. Greg Peters : Makes sense. And then the other thing that you announced as part of your earnings release and preannouncement was this -- the litigation settlement relating to Boy Scouts. I know you probably don't really want to comment on specific accounts, but there's still the lingering uncertainty regarding business interruption. Can you give us some sense about your approach to how you deal with these cases as they come up whether it's a bankruptcy case or the -- what you're doing from a reserve standpoint for business interruption? Just because we haven't seen a lot of other news from your competitors. Just give us an updated perspective would be helpful? Chris Swift : Greg, I would share a couple points with you one regarding Boy Scouts and then the second on BI. I would say Boy Scouts, obviously is just a very unique situation. We've been in lengthy and meaningful discussions and intense negotiations with them for a lengthy period of time that ultimately culminated in providing what I thought was a fair settlement for all parties. And it really sort of puts this behind us. Because when you really looked at the risk of these -- some of these policies going back into the '70s, they were on aggregated risk policies as most of those policies were issued during that time. So if you think in terms of the nature of the industry being sexual molestation it just -- there are not good facts there. Now on the other hand, we felt we had prudent defenses and legal postures to ultimately defend ourselves. But that would have been costly, that would have been lengthy. And as Boy Scouts are trying to emerge from bankruptcy there was an opportunity and we seized it to work with them to develop the settlement that we did. The settlement ultimately still needs to be approved later this year, but we're optimistic it will get the bankruptcy court approval. So what I would share with you I don't see anything else in our portfolio close to resembling what the Boy Scouts exposures are. I feel good about the reserves that we have for any exposures, but particularly the sexual molestation types of reserves that we carry on the books today. On the BI matter, I think why you're not hearing everything is because quite honestly it's going pretty well. I think the vast majority of courts both state and federal are interpreting the policy language as we've anticipated. I think you've heard me say that our policy language is clear unambiguous. The virus does not cause physical damage to the property. Shutdowns were governments-ordered for safety reasons. And I think it will ultimately continue to play out favorably over time. We haven't changed our reserve posture. We continue to carry expense reserves for litigation. But we do not carry any incurred losses for business interruption exposures. Greg Peters : Got it. Well thank you for the answers and for the guidance for 2022 and 2023. Chris Swift : Thank you. Susan Spivak : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on the buyback front. So, you guys raised the authorization today and added to what you're going to repurchase in both years. So, can you just give us a sense of what changed for you to be more incrementally bullish on the capital return over the next two years? And then to finance, the incremental buyback to the dividends, you're expecting from your subs for this year have those changed, or is it just coming from excess capital at the holding company? Chris Swift : Yes. Elyse, I'll comment on sort of the why and then Beth could comment on the details. So, as I tried to say in our opening it just -- as we got into this year, just -- we're more encouraged on the economy and the recovery. You could feel our growth orientation. You could see it in really our first quarter results, where topline is really moving from a growth side. And when you put it all together, we looked out over the number of years and we just have greater clarity and certainty that the pandemic is in the rearview mirror. And we upped our share authorization that the Board ultimately supported. Beth Costello : Yes. Then Elyse, as it relates to funding, the share repurchases for this year it really is a combination of using cash at the holding company, as well as increasing slightly the dividend that we'd expect from the P&C subsidiary. So we had said about $850 million to $900 million. And we're probably going to be more in like the $900 million to $1.1 billion for this year. Elyse Greenspan : And so the $900 million to $1.1 billion for this year, would that also be kind of good expectations as we think about 2022 baseline? Beth Costello : Yes. I would definitely see it in that range to maybe even slightly higher. But yes, that's what we're thinking about. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then in terms of the commercial underlying margin, you guys laid out a two point improvement target for 2022. Can you help give us a sense of how much of that is loss ratio-driven versus expense ratio-driven from Hartford Next? And what is the pricing -- Commercial Lines pricing assumptions that you have embedded within that underlying margin guidance? Beth Costello : So, I'll start and then I'll let Doug follow up. But as we think about those -- that two points I would say it's roughly half and half between loss ratio and expense ratio improvement. Doug Elliot : And Elyse, as we think about pricing, although we did not disclose and will not disclose all the specific details, generally, as we work our way through '21, we expect to see more of what we saw in the first quarter. And as we move into '22, we think pricing probably will come off a little bit, but still in shape to deal with loss cost trend in various lines. Elyse Greenspan : Does that 2022 guidance assume an inflection within the workers' comp pricing environment? Doug Elliot : Certainly, in 2021 on the written side, it suggests several quarters that look like the first quarter. And then, I think we'll have to see about '22 and '23 as we get there, but generally a stable slightly improving workers' comp pricing environment. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks for the color. Doug Elliot : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Dwelle of RBC. Mark, please proceed. Mark Dwelle : Yes. Just a further question related to the buyback. And I know buybacks are very popular with investors and usually considered a good use of capital. But I guess, given the share valuation and the growth options that you seem to have in front of you, why is increasing the buyback, the best use of an additional $1 billion to $1.5 billion of funds as compared to pursuing accretive acquisitions or just other internal growth opportunities? Chris Swift : Yes, Mark. I would say, we have plenty of capital to fund all our growth ambitions. So, it's not a -- I'll call it either-or decision. We have capital to grow. We expect to generate additional capital in the future, and \u2013 but I think that, the simple fact is, we have been, I thought wise during the pandemic with our capital and making sure that we can absorb any potential shocks that still might be out there. And then as it relates to M&A, I think I've been pretty consistent. It's just a low priority for us right now. And the reason it's a low priority is, I really believe we have everything as I say colloquially in the building to compete over the long term. It's maturing it, it's making sure our agents and brokers fully understand all our capabilities that we've built, or added over the years, and that's what we're focused on. And I think that's an appropriate strategy for where we are in our development right now. Mark Dwelle : Okay. That was the only question I had. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Please proceed. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Appreciate seeing the written correspondences between The Hartford and Chubb in your 8-K. I mean, letters are one thing, but there's a human side of the story. Wondering Chris if you and Evan ever got in a room together to actually engage in a meaningful discussion in your due diligence. Why not hear the guy out? Chris Swift : Yeah. I would just share with you we're still in a pandemic, so that did not happen. And if you really look at our statements and our messages that, the Board has put out, I mean, it's pretty clear that we had no interest in doing that, because of ultimately the conviction and commitment around executing our business plan. So that's what I would say, Tracy. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. So even virtually speaking you mentioned the pandemic that didn't happen? Chris Swift : It's been mostly letter correspondence. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And then something else on Chubb, sorry, we dug up your Boy Scouts Association mediation settlement. And there was a direct mention of Chubb in that report, where you would actually get a settlement discount depending on how Chubb's settlement shapes up. What is that all about? Chris Swift : Yeah. I would just generally characterize it as a term and condition that Boy Scouts agreed to that ultimately tried to be equitable with all carriers in their exposures, and not favor one group versus the other. So it works as a most-favored-nations type clause. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian, please proceed. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thanks. So two questions here. The first one, I'm just curious, Beth on the guidance, what is your interest rate assumption on the ROE targets? Are you assuming interest rates are up here? How about kind of rates versus new money yields versus book yields? Beth Costello : Yeah. So when we make our projections, we really look at sort of just following the forward curve, and what we would expect to see there. And again, even though rates are going up, just because they're going up in the near term, we'd expect to see some marginal benefit from that. But really that comes out in the outer years, just given the way that our portfolio turns over. And so when I think about investment yield sort of ex limited partnerships over the next two years, I kind of see it, sort of consistent with where we are today. Brian Meredith : Terrific. Thank you. And then my second question, because I'm just curious, I appreciate you don't want to talk about the Chubb situation. But I guess, my question is this, what would it take you think for the Board to believe that they've got a fiduciary obligation to talk to a potential acquirer? Chris Swift : Yeah, you're right. Yeah, Brian, you're right. I'm not going to talk about it, because I think our statements are clear and unambiguous as far as our intentions, our views. We know our fiduciary duties. So that's all I'm going to say, Brian. Brian Meredith : Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Mike, please proceed. Mike Zaremski : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe focusing, again, I know there's been a lot of questions and good color on the ROE guidance, I think in the past you kind of \u2013 you said, the anchor was around \u2013 it was 12%. And now you're saying 12% to 13% and if I look at \u2013 Chris Swift : 13% to 14%, Mike. Mike Zaremski : 13% to 14%, okay. Chris Swift : 13% to 14% just to make sure. Mike Zaremski : Yes. Thank you. It's been a busy morning. So if I look at consensus, I think consensus for '22 for example is high 11s, what I'm looking at. And so there seems to be a big delta. So I'm curious if you have opinions on where -- what the consensus may be underappreciating other than clearly you've upped the buyback guidance versus consensus this morning? Chris Swift : Yes. It's probably the biggest item. So I think you've just got to go back update your models, put everything that we talked about into your models today and I think you will be very pleased. Mike Zaremski : Okay. And so there's -- I guess there's one element that I get at which I think it's tougher for us to fully appreciate and might be kind of on the reserve release side. So you don't think that could be an element The Street is underappreciating? Chris Swift : Obviously, we don't project and guide to reserve releases because we make our best estimates every quarter. But I think some analysts as you know do take a view and do their own homework on reserves and potential releases. And I think those that do their homework and really understand the reserving philosophy and how we've set our picks over the last couple years will come to a point of view that is most likely positive. Beth Costello : The only thing I would add to that is, I do think given the color that we provided on what we expect for underlying margin improvement in commercial lines and I think that's another factor to be looked at. And again, I think we've provided some road map there for folks to absorb. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Thank you. And my last question is on the commercial pricing environment. And I guess if you would like to comment on personal lines too feel free. But my question is it feels -- you're the second carrier to kind of talk about rates coming down from very healthy levels. Kind of curious is it a function of Hartford kind of being willing to pull off the gas a little bit too to enable growth, or is it more just market conditions are causing pricing to fall, or is it a mix of both?  I guess one carrier that plays in a little different of a sandbox than Hartford kind of basically was saying that they're willing to pull off the gas because pricing levels are healthy and they feel good about margin improvement. So just kind of curious if any color there on the market dynamics? Doug Elliot : I would say it's a multifaceted answer. There's geography, there's class, there's size. There are all different dynamics in it. And what I tried to say in my opening answer to a question is that, generally across our books of business, we are feeling much more rate-adequate today. So that does change our competitive mode in the marketplace. But it is all driven by line, it's driven by account experience and so like it is so hard to just give you one answer that fits everything. There's a different set of priorities we have in global specialty and you can see the progress we've made there.  And then I will offer that the power that the re-underwriting retuning these books of business have transformed themselves over the past 18 months is also very much a part of our loss performance today. So I would never use the words foot off the accelerator. I don't think about it like that. What I care deeply about is our returns by line, our retentions across key customer segments, our segmentation strategies et cetera. And I feel right now when I look across our books very solid about where we are and how we move into the latter half of 2021 as we manage all of those indicators. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. David, please proceed. David Motemaden : Hi. Good morning. I guess just a question first just on the group benefits guide, the margin guide to 6% to 7% in 2022. I guess, I'm just wondering why that is still -- it's down versus where your guide was in 2020 consistent with 2021 ex-COVID. But it does seem like you have a bit more expense save. So wondering if you could unpack that just a little bit. Chris Swift : Sure, David. I think, the simple answer is, we've talked about it in the past that the year-over-year improvements and incidences being driven down in recoveries and in favorable developments -- favorable prior year developments, all is going to sort of revert back to a mean. And what that really means is that our current accident year, in essence, accident year loss ratios we established are going to be closer to ultimate than they were five years ago when they were quite a bit higher. So it's still a margin -- a 6% to 7% margin in that business still produces a solid double-digit ROE. IRRs are strong. So it's a healthy margin. But particularly with all the prior year reserve releases, we just don't see that happening going forward, just because our current picks are established a lot lower. David Motemaden : Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then Chris, I guess, you spoke to in response to an earlier question, just about how there aren't really any product gaps you feel like at HIG. I guess one thing I'm wondering is, coming at it from a bit -- the other side of it and specifically thinking about the Mutual Funds business, I guess, I'm just wondering if you could just remind me what the strategic importance of the Mutual Funds business is, in the context of the broader organization of Hartford. I understand it does produce around $100 million to $150 million of cash every year. So that's obviously an important consideration. But maybe just help me think just how it fits strategically with your other businesses. Thank you. Chris Swift : Yes, I think, you got it right. I mean, it is a good business. It's a growing business. It's creating shareholder value. We get nice returns and dividends. It's a high IRR, ROE business. And we view it as an investment. It's sort of a stand-alone business unit in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. It doesn't take very much management time. And I think we enjoy the benefits of a business unit that is growing in value creating value. And as long as they remain relevant, we're happy to own it. It shares the Hartford brand name with us. That means something in sort of the independent investment adviser space so -- but I view it as an investment, totally, David. Operator : And our next question comes from Jim Bhullar of JPMorgan. Please proceed. Jim Bhullar : Hi. Good morning. So, first, I had a question for Chris. On your statement that like a $70 offer is not in the best interest of shareholders. I'm just wondering if you could discuss what the basis for that is. If you -- like, is it based on your earnings power, other offers you could receive, or whatever else the basis is for that statement? And then secondly, for Doug, if you could talk about how you think about workers' compensation, loss trends. If the economy continues to heat up, do you think there's a likelihood of an uptick in losses in that line? Thanks. Chris Swift : Jimmy, I'll start. Again, I'm not going to comment. I think our disclosures on this, again, were crystal clear, as far as what the Board went through and why it decided what it did. And beyond that I'm not going to comment any further, Jimmy. Doug Elliot : On the workers' comp question, Jimmy, I would say this, as we come through the pandemic out the back side of it, we're watching carefully frequency and severity. We've had our eye on severity for the last couple of years, just wondering, might we see a little bit of a surge relative to long haulers on COVID, or other parts of our platform. But we have not come off our long-range assumptions for loss trend in either severity. And, yes, we do expect frequency will return to more normal levels, as we get out into 2021 second half and 2022. Jim Bhullar : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Please proceed. Josh Shanker : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. We've talked in the last couple of calls about how AARP is allowing you to non-renew customers who come into the pool, if they turn out not to be attractive customer types. I don't really detect any change in the trends, in the Personal Lines business. Has that been implemented yet? And is there a way that we'll detect, new customer acquisition coming in as an inflection? Doug Elliot : Josh, most of those states we have now implemented that activity effective first of the year. It's going to take a little bit of time for that to work its way in. And obviously, it's a big component of our pricing, relative to the new auto product Prevail and our homeowners' product mid-summer. So, we expect in the future, you'll see more impact from, not only that but a number of changes we've made in the product profile going forward. Josh Shanker : Okay. And then, on -- if I net out the Boy Scouts charge, in the disclosure on favorable development by line of business, I'm just -- it looks to me it was a very, very favorable quarter for GL. Can we talk about, accident years, how they're maturing? And what sort of led to that? And maybe I'm misreading it. Beth Costello : Yeah. So Josh, I think, you're misreading that. We haven't disclosed specifically, what component of the general liability piece was Boy Scouts. But I can tell you it was a significant piece of that. So I wouldn't do a significant read-through, as it relates to more current years for general liability. Josh Shanker : But broadly speaking am I right in saying that, it was a very favorable quarter for you? It seems like the math works out that that's... Beth Costello : \u2026 for general liability? Josh Shanker : Or broadly in commercial, maybe it's not all... Beth Costello : Yeah. No. I think broadly in commercial, I agree. If you back out the general liability piece and you can see that, we continue to have favorable development in workers' compensation and package business. So, yeah, I think the trends are pretty clearly laid out in our investor financial supplement. Josh Shanker : And so coming back to the question, what years are really causing this? I mean, you don't have to be so specific. But is there a way of like sort of thinking about, how different years are maturing? Beth Costello : Yeah. So for the workers' compensation piece, it's really more in the 2017 and prior, is where that favorability is coming from, very limited in the current years, because again it takes a little bit for those to season. And I would say the same thing with the package business it's more, 2015 and prior. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much. Doug Elliot : Josh, I would just add this. Maybe this will help a little bit. We were carrying reserves for BSA prior to this quarter, right? So we haven't disclosed all the particulars, but you just need to know that we've been following those activities over the last several quarters, several years et cetera. That just should be part of your analysis. Josh Shanker : That's very helpful. Operator : And our last question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer, please proceed. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks. Good morning. A question for Doug to begin, I guess, if we're heading into an unprecedented economic recovery with the reversal of the pandemic and I guess possibly government stimulus. Can you talk about the risk of other lines besides workers' compensation seeing unanticipated frequency? Doug Elliot : Meyer, we're watching all those signals obviously. And as we've shared this morning we think we have optimism in our top line approach. But clearly we're watching loss trends and liability, relative to courts becoming more open, as dockets fill up and begin to work their way through. We're watching the automobile market. We expect more cars on the highways, et cetera, so we're watching frequency there. We're watching across all our lines. We're watching our specialty lines D&O, management liability, employment practices et cetera. So, yes, we have our eye on the frequency dynamic and the severity component as well. This is an active time. The backside of 2021 will look different, we feel than the first six months of 2020. But we're encouraged and we'll stay vigilant. And we'll adjust pricing and appetite accordingly. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful and then, just a really yes or no question. If we see wages rise does that translate into severity on the indemnity component of workers' compensation in your book? Doug Elliot : Wage, pure wage, without \u2026 Meyer Shields : Yeah. Doug Elliot : \u2026number of employees? Okay. I mean pure wage should be a hedge against loss trend, just pure wage, so, whether it's merit of 2.5%, 3%. Now, if we talk about wages due to number of workers that is a different dynamic that we will manage our way through frequency and severity with. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to, Susan Spivak for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Ian. We appreciate all of you joining us this morning, on relatively short notice. Please do not hesitate to contact me, if you have any follow-up questions. And look forward to speaking next quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I'll now hand over to your host, Ms. Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations to begin. Ms. Susan Spivak, please go ahead. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Harry. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today for our call and webcast on second quarter 2021 earnings. Last night, we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our website. For the call today our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer and Doug Elliot, President. Chris Swift : Thank you for joining us this morning. Last quarter, I shared that I had never been more excited about the future of The Hartford. Our second quarter results support that optimism. All the components of our strategy are coming together to deliver growth, margin expansion and operating efficiencies. In the second quarter, we reported core earnings of $836 million or $2.33 per diluted share, 8% growth in year-over-year diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 13.1%. In addition, we returned $694 million to shareholders in the quarter from share repurchases and common dividends. The outstanding financial performance of The Hartford reflects strong execution and success of our strategy to focus on high return businesses where we have market leadership and sustainable competitive advantages. Economic growth, as measured by GDP, reached a record level in the second quarter. And while moderation is expected, the overall trend will remain elevated through 2021. This economic expansion will grow the premium base of our employment-centric businesses and other lines as they benefit from job creation and new business formations. Meanwhile, we are closely monitoring the recent elevated inflation data and remain confident that our loss ratio assumptions are sufficient against this backdrop in 2021. At the same time, we are considering pricing actions as we gauge inflation trends going forward. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter and our progress on our priorities to enhance value creation for shareholders. Second quarter core earnings were $836 million or $2.33 per diluted share and up 91% from last year. We had strong performance across all our businesses, excellent investment results and significantly lower COVID losses, as compared to the prior year period. In P&C, the combined ratio of 88.5 improved 8.4 points from the second quarter of 2020, including improvements in both the loss and expense ratios. The expense ratio in the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 31%, reflecting earned premium growth as well as cost savings from Hartford Next and a lower provision for doubtful accounts. In Commercial Lines, we produced an excellent underlying combined ratio of 89.4, which included ex-COVID loss ratio improvement in Middle & Large Commercial and in Global Specialty and expense ratio improvement across all businesses. Doug Elliot : Thanks, Beth, and good morning, everyone. Six months into the year, I couldn't be prouder of our performance. Within Property and Casualty, we're meeting or exceeding expectations on nearly all our key financial metrics. In the second quarter, Property and Casualty produced an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 89.2. Premium growth accelerated in commercial. Pricing remains strong and ahead of loss trends for most product lines and early results from the lunch of our new personal lines product were encoring. As Beth mentioned commercial lines produced a stealer underwriting combined ratio of $89.4 with year-over-year improvement in the both loss and expense ratios, before providing more color on commercial pricing and loss trends let me spend a few minutes on top line performance. Small commercial written premium increased 11%, as anticipated we are benefiting from an improving economy with increases in payroll and wages contributing to the quarter's top line results. New business of a 170 million was up 44% as we had our second consecutive exceptional quarter. Our top products spectrum continuous to drive our new business success, this industry leading contemporary offering achieved record new business of 75 million or 52% growth over prior year. In addition small commercial achieved important underwriting efficiency milestones during the quarter. In June, 75% of quotes were bind the bill with little or no touch underwriting a material increase over just two years ago. This is a key driver of growth as the yield on bindable business is particularly strong, and the efficiency leverage is equally important. The sophistication of our proprietary pricing model gives us confidence in the quality of our bindable business and is reflected in Small Commercial's underlying profitability. Middle & Large Commercial accelerated into the second quarter, producing superior written premium growth of 20%. Middle Market new business of $147 million, up 48%, was at its highest level in two years. I'm particularly pleased we achieved this result while maintaining underwriting discipline, as measured by our pricing metrics and risk scores. Policy retention in Middle Market increased four points to 82%, while maintaining disciplined risk by risk underwriting decisions using our increasingly refined segmentation tools. Like Small Commercial, increased payroll and rising wages contributed to the second quarter Middle & Large Commercial premium growth of 20%. Global Specialty produced another strong quarter with written premium growth of 16%. New business growth of 27% was equally impressive and retention is up significantly from prior year. In the quarter, the breadth of our written premium growth was led by 25% in wholesale and 18% in U.S. Financial Lines. Global Reinsurance also had an excellent quarter with written premium growth of 26%. As I've mentioned previously, cross-sell activities are an important component of our growth strategy. During the quarter, cross-sell new business premium between Global Specialty and middle market was 28 mill or 11% of related new business sold by these segments. Since the navigators acquisition this effort has delivered 185 million in new business and is on pace to eclipse. Our initial goal of 200 million a year early. We now have close to 2,500 accounts with policies that record premium in both metal market and global specially. We're also particularly encouraged by the success of our industry specialization strategy built both organically and through the navigators acquisition, for example the acquired retail access and U.S. Financial Lines are significant contributors to our cross sell execution. The combined new business growth from these two lines has increased more than 50% since the acquisition. After years of development, we view our product breadth as a competitive strength. Let's move on to pricing metrics. U.S. standard lines and Global Specialty commercial pricing, excluding workers' compensation, was 9.2% of market. Middle Market compensation price change of 8.2, although down 1.1 points, continue to see loss trend and then reflect improved profitability performance. In the workers' compensation, renewal re-pricing was 1% in the quarter, a key indicator to future pricing include the impact of the 2020 pandemic trends on 2022 loss cost filings. We will be closely monitoring these filings in the coming months on a state-by-state basis. Global Specialty renewal written price remained strong in the U.S. at 11% and international at 24%. All in, I'm very pleased with our pricing this quarter. Turning to commercial loss trends. The second quarter current accident year loss ratio was largely in line with expectations. We are intensely watching inflation and have been particularly dialed in to recent building repair costs and rising wage trends. Within large commercial property, small commercial recorded a few large fire losses in the quarter. And in Global Specialty international, we incurred a large offshore energy loss. Both were within a normal range of expected volatility. Overall, Middle Market property loss ratios were slightly favorable to expectations in the quarter. Favorable claim frequency was partially offset by an increase in severity related to labor and material costs. While we believe property severity trends may be slightly elevated for the rest of the year-on-year.ar, we remain confident in our initial full year Middle Market property loss ratio expectation. Shifting to workers' compensation. The economic recovery is driving wage growth for our worker population. This wage growth translates into higher premiums and wage replacement benefits. Generally speaking, the net impact is a minor improvement in the workers' compensation loss ratio. Combining earned pricing and loss trends. I'm pleased with the continued strong current accident year performance. In the quarter, the Commercial Lines underlying x COVID loss ratio was 57%, 1.3 points better than Q2 of last year. Let's now turn to Personal Lines. As expected, the second quarter underlying combined ratio rose 7.5 points to 88.2. Auto frequency is elevating with increasing vehicle trips and miles traveled, but our book is still favorable to pre-pandemic levels. As expected, home losses were higher versus a very strong prior year. Overall, we had favorable claims frequency in the quarter, which was offset by higher claim severity driven by modestly higher-than-expected large x-CAT fire losses and a provision for elevated building material and labor costs. Written premium declined 5% after adjusting for both the second quarter 2020 extended billing grace period and the $80 - $81 million refund. According to J.D. Power, auto shopping rates amongst the 50-plus age segment are down approximately 5% from third quarter 2020 when they first initiated the survey. Persistency of the shopping trend may continue to pressure new business growth for our customer base. However, increased marketing spend in the quarter drove June new business premium above expectations, and policy retention was up one point as compared to prior year. We're also encouraged by the early results from the launch of our new contemporary Personal Lines auto and home product prevail. Through the second quarter, yield, average issued premium and policy counts all met or exceeded expectations. Both products are now available in Arizona and Illinois. Seven additional states, along with advanced capabilities will be online by year-end, and we remain confident in our long-term growth plan for personal lines. Before turning the call back to Susan for questions and answers, let me conclude. Property and Casualty achieved another outstanding quarter. Our top line outperformed, providing confidence we will achieve our commercial lines 4% to 5% multi-year CAGR guidance. Strong pricing is earning into the book driving lower current accident loss ratios, and the expense ratio continues to benefit from our ongoing Hartford Next initiatives. We are seeing the positive results of our multi-year road map with deeper and broader products, improved risk selection and outstanding execution. I'm thrilled with our continued progress and look forward to updating you in 90 days. Let me now turn the call back over to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thanks, Doug. Operator, we'll take questions now. Operator : Thank you. Susan. Our first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Greg, your line up. You\u2019re open now if you would like to ask your question. Greg Peters : The first question is the outlook for growth in commercial lines. You provided a lot of detail around pricing and retention and the new business successes you've had in the different areas of commercial lines. But Chris, I think in your comments, you said growth - you said moderation is expected. So I guess I'm trying to reconcile what was a really strong second quarter and a positive outlook with those comments. Chris Swift : Yes. I think the context of that, Greg, was in relation to GDP. So I was speaking that GDP is running, what, 8%, 9%, probably 9% here. And then I do expect some moderation in, I'll call it, the macro numbers. But as Doug said in his comments, and I'll let him also comment here, is that we're still very bullish on our ability to grow in that 4% to 5% compounded written premium growth over the outlook period through 2022. So, we're not backing off from that. In fact, we're probably even a little bit more bullish as we sit here today than we were 90 days ago. But Doug, what would you add? DougElliot: I would just add Greg that, when you look at small, and I'll do small and middle separate, we had nice TIF growth in the small segments, so 2.5 to 3 points of TIF growth quarter-to-quarter. We've been on a positive pricing trend for a couple of months. What we had the benefit of in the quarter is a little extra win behind us relative to auto premium so that's driving inside the 11, several extra points of boost, but I don't want to minimize at all the tests and the pricing movement and the new business success we're seeing in small. And then on the middle front, probably have a little bit more boost from auto premiums, so the 20 is a bit outsized relative to longer term expectations, but still terrific new business quarter, pricing is strong. We expect pricing trends to remain solid and strong, and so I'm bullish about where we're headed going forward. I just would point out that we had a compare to second quarter 2020 that probably won't repeat itself in Q3 and Q4. Greg Peters : That makes sense. I guess my follow-up question would be, in the personalized business. Obviously inflation is high on everyone's list. The courts are reopening. There's cost pressure, and then there's the added pressure from increasing miles frequency. And I was just wondering if you could comment in the context of your second quarter results would you seeing sequential deterioration in some of these markets as you move through the quarter, so that when we get to the third quarter, we might see some continuous erosion as a result of some of the factors I mentioned. Chris Swift : So specifically the personalized, what I shared on my comments and I can I elaborate a little bit more here is that, our auto book is seeing increased miles driven, but not yet had pre-COVID, pre-pandemic levels, right. So we're still slightly better than we were in 2019 as we look through the COVID period, we are conscious of repair costs, we're conscious of all of the dynamics that go into our cost of goods sold, and we think we've made appropriate provisions in our recording of our reserves for second quarter. But yes, we are watching that intensely relative to inflation pressures. Relative to homeowners, I did comment that we also made applicable provisions for labor and material costs. We saw some of those spikes earlier in the year, particularly in the early part of the second quarter, into the mid-second quarter. As we listen to the inflationary expectations, we expect some of those trends will be with us into the third quarter, fourth quarter, but I think that given our trends, our expectations that you're having changed materially and we're on top of our selections and I think we're in good shape as we move into Q3. Greg Peters : Just as a follow-up on that Doug. When we talk about homeowners, a lot of the premium levels are set off of replacement costs. Is this - do the inflationary pressures, are they causing any go back and reset what the replacement costs are for your existing enforcer. Maybe you can walk me through how you approach that. DougElliot: Yes. We have an estimator that deals with replacement costs and we now on a state by state basis are going back resetting that, building that into our pricing going forward. So the book does work 60, 90 days in advance, but we have been working on those discussions since earlier part of the summer as these spikes were not going to go away. So yes, we are moving insurance value adjustments across our homeowners' base and policies. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David, your line will be open now, if you'd like to proceed with your question. David Motemaden : I just had a question for Doug on the commercial lines underlying loss ratio ex-CAT. Solid improvement in the quarter. The 1.3 points kind of slowed a bit versus the level of improvement we saw last quarter, which was over two points, I guess, could you sort of walk through why, you know obviously still impressive margin improvement but why it decelerated, and how you're feeling about reaching the two points of underlying loss ratio improvement target for 2021? Doug Elliot : Yes, I would say consistent, favorable direction moves on loss ratio. I did mention a couple areas we had volatility and property, so if you think about small commercial and international global specially, a little bit in the quarter volatility that was working against that improvement, but yes, I'm still confident in the long term trend and feel like our experts are all over our reserve pics. David Motemaden : And then maybe just a follow up question on personal lines. So, good to see some of the initiatives here. I'm just kind of looking at the TIF growth and I don't think you know we've seen TIF growth in the last five or six years. I guess I'm wondering if you can share with us some milestones you have for growth and things that we can track and maybe how you're thinking about potential alternatives for that business if some of the growth initiatives don't translate to higher growth. Doug Elliot : So why don't I start and then Chris and Beth however you want to come over the top. I\u2019ll start by saying that we had concluded several years back that we had to go through a major upgrade of our contemporary product right, so that is now just dropping into the marketplace. The early signs are positive as expected. The reason we move to two states is we wanted to test heavily two states before we drop the next one. So, in terms of major milestones by year end, an additional seven states as I talked about, and then by the end of '22 will be an all-state, so pretty aggressive next 15 months rollout program. We will watch state by state to make corrections as we go forward but, you know, we're very excited about the components. We have basically rebuilt every bit of this chassis from the product to the way it's delivered to the digital capabilities to be serviced. We think we've listened hard to our customers, which primarily are in that plus 50 set. They have helped us design that. Again the early reaction and results are positive, so long way to go, but we think this leads us to attract a profitable growth. We've shared those expectations and I sit here today and don't feel any different about our long term path. Beth or Chris? ChrisSwift: I think you summarized it well. David, I think strategically, we're giving ourselves at least a couple of years after we were fully rolled out in all 50 states to really make an assessment, can we compete with our differentiated product offerings. Our hypothesis going in is yes, we have a strong brand in personal lines. We have a wonderful endorsement from AARP. We have unique features in how we serve this market segment. It's a demographic that's growing. As I said in my commentary, we have a new 10-year contract with the AARP that really modernizes the whole relationship and how we go to market. So I think it's an investment worth making. Obviously, that's why we did what we did. But I think the - post 2022 when we're really more proactive, Doug, in all 50 states would be the ultimate time period to watch our PIF count start to grow. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Gary, your line will be open now, if you would love to proceed with your question. Gary Ransom : Regarding the gap between rate and loss trend. I wanted to ask not so much about the size of the gap, but where we are in the cycle of that gap? And looking at small middle specialty separately how many years do you think we're into the period where rates have been ahead of loss trend? I realize it might be a better answer by line, but I was kind of thinking about the three segments that you have as well? Chris Swift : Gary, I actually do think about the answer by segment, I think that small commercial pricing curve is very different, at least it is different in our book of business. We've had an extended period of outstanding returns. So the rate need has not been as clear there. We basically have been rate adequate for an extended period. I want trend, but Gary, a much more moderated cycle and small. The other side of the coin will be to flip into some of these specialty areas that have had significant rate need. And I would call that we're entering to me, Q9, Q10 of that. This really started picking up pace in the second quarter of 2019. And it had some positivity before that. But really eight very strong quarters, from my opinion, in areas that drastically needed that. And we've talked quite at length about some of those drivers of that. And then in the middle, our Middle Market, where you have the cross-section of auto GL property, each of those lines has their own story. We've had, as an industry, very disappointing property results over an extended period, and weather has been a part of it and so have other dynamics. We've had a commercial auto loss ratio and the industry that's been very stubborn. So those lines also have been on seven, eight quarters of positive rate movement. I think there's still more work to be done in that Middle Market area, and I don't think that's a hate comment. I think that's a market comment. I can only see what I can see. But - so I answered your question in three ways. I still think this market has some legs. And as we look at our book, yes, we are much more rate adequate in general across segments of our book, but we also have smaller segments that need some work, and we intend to get after that work as we move through the latter half of 2021. Beth Costello : Gary, you of all people know, given your views in writings, the impact, particularly in casualty lines of social inflation is real. So as we talk internally, the need to continue to push for more rate, just knowing that the long-term trends have not been in our favor, whether it be in courts, whether it be in financial lines, whether it be in other casualty related exposures. And then you can't forget that the 10 years at 1.3% these days. So clearly, we've been talking about it for a long time. We're in a lower for longer period of time. We just need a greater contribution from our underwriting component to fuel our returns, and that's what we intend to do. Gary Ransom : Thank you for that answer. If I could ask a question on a different topic. In group, where you showed the excess mortality, and if I put back the excess mortality that you said developed from Q1, I can revise the trends to about $125 million roughly in Q1 in excess going to 88 in Q2. And when I look at the CDC data, it looks like it's just falling off a lot more than that. And maybe that\u2019s apples - not apples-on-apples, but can you comment about what's going on there? Is it your decline - you're not really seeing that as much decline there? Chris Swift : Yes. In the dollars, I would say you're right. I mean if you look at it from dollars, but if you are tracking deaths, which I know you are, like we are, I mean the drop is significant. It's - from its peak, I calculated down close to 75%. What I said in my commentary, Gary, is that severity is up, so that if you look at the number of death claims, the average amounts that we're paying, it's up from the beginning of the pandemic fairly significantly, and it's up from the second quarter. I would say we probably had eight or nine large losses above $1 million this quarter. When anyone - we probably had more than that. That was just in June. So we probably had 15 or 20 large losses when you really expect for a month. So you put it all together. And when the younger folks' mortalities increased significantly; working age, they tend to carry larger face amounts, and we're seeing that come through in the dollars. But as I ultimately tried to foreshadow is that, and we've been talking about this consistently, is that the first half of 2021 and the second half is going to be dramatically different. So deaths - daily deaths are continuing to be down, and we do feel a lessening impact of excess mortality in the second half of the year. Beth Costello : The only thing I'd add to that, too, Gary, if you're looking at COVID deaths, just remind you that when we talk about excess mortality, it's all-in excess. It's not just that that have a cause of death that says COVID. And so when we look through our numbers, part of the reason for the - a large part of the revision for first quarter is that that excess non-COVID came in much more favorably than we had anticipated. Our COVID losses came in a little bit better as well, but that was driving the revision. And when we provided our provision for second quarter, we're assuming some of that excess mortality that we anticipated in the first quarter would be there. So when you look through it, the COVID losses that are truly coded as COVID are coming down. It's that excess piece, which, as you know, has been hard to predict. So it's not just for us. Chris Swift : The first, that's a great point, Beth. Thank you for the clarification. The theory could be, Gary that we just had less flu deaths than we seasonally, sort of, expected in the numbers. But clearly, there was a first quarter benefit for all other excess mortality outside of COVID. Gary Ransom : Thank you very much for those answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line would be open now, if you would like to proceed with your question. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, I want to go back, Chris, to some of your opening comments. You mentioned recent elevated inflation data but that you also got your loss ratio assumptions sufficient against this. But then you guys did mention considering taking pricing taking pricing actions, so if you are considering taking pricing actions wouldn't that imply that inflation might be running higher than you expected? And I know we touched on this a little bit during the call, but I'm hoping just if you could flush out like what areas of inflation you're most worried about in terms of impacting your profitability. Chris Swift : And Doug and I will tag team here. So yes. I think the general comment that inflation is up. You've written about it and others have too. It's fairly self-evident. I think when we looked at our picks and our loss ratio picks, particularly in our property and the homeowners' lines, as Doug described, there's activities that are positive, and there's activities that are headwinds. When we net out all the positives and negatives, positive as being mostly frequency, against the severity pickup, whether it be inflationary or large loss activity, it still nets out where we are picks for home and property on a full year basis, we think are going to hold. So - and Doug, I think that the pricing actions that we've talked about are primarily in the homeowners' line, where we're trying to keep up with inflationary side, particularly on our insured values on Schedule As, and we have some programs and some new things that we've added to keep up with schedule A values. Doug Elliot : Absolutely. And in addition, we're also looking at insured values in our Small Commercial and our Middle Market properties. So in general, Elyse, we are on top of this property issue in terms of value replacement, what it will cost to repair facilities, buildings, et cetera - with what we're feeling through the cost of goods sold. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. So then on inflation, you would say this is really just property and home. Within your other Commercial Lines, everything is still in line with your expectations? Chris Swift : Yes. We're watching auto carefully because they - it's been well chronicled auto parts. The timing to get the parts, the labor to put the parts in, a little bit of pressure there. That will obviously matter to severity, and we're watching frequency and severity together. So generally, we've had better frequency patterns that have offset some of the severity dynamics. But we are very tuned into what the inflation curve is going to look like on labor and material for all of our lines. And I think we're in a good spot, but we're - I can't sit here today and say we know exactly how the fourth quarter will drop yet. It's going to take us several quarters to figure that out as data comes in. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question, you guys are running ahead of pace relative to the buyback plan outlined for this year. And some of the dividend figures you provided from the subset, I think, are a little bit higher than you had expected. So is there a chance you could come in above the 1.5 for this year? Depending upon your stock is, if you guys look to take advantage, could more of the buyback program potentially be front-loaded? Chris Swift : Yes, I'm glad you noticed that, Elyse. We have been, as I said, in my comments, proactive and prudent in managing our capital. So, yes, a lot of things are possible, but we're basically six months into our two-year buyback program. I still think buying back $2.5 billion is, again, the right action to manage our excess capital. And from any one quarter or any one period of time, there could be acceleration or deceleration depending on what we're seeing happening in the marketplace. But Beth, what would you say? Beth Costello : Yes. I think we've characterized that well, I think on the dividends, Elyse, yeah the range we tightened primarily as it relates to P&C. So we had said that we expect $900 million to $1 billion - $1.1 billion, and now we're at $1 billion to $1.1 billion. So trending on the high side but that's not a significant change there. And I think we're on a good pace. We had said when we announced increase in the program in April that we weren't intending to do it ratably over the period. And I think that the actions we've taken have shown that. So that's all I would add. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian your line will be open if you\u2019d like to proceed with your question now. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thank you. Yes, a couple of them here. First, I just want to dig a little bit on workers' comp, Chris and Doug. Doug, I know you mentioned that you're looking at loss cost filings for 2022 and that's a key determinant of what pricing look like for workers' comp. Any early indications what those are going to look like? What's the NCCI saying with respect to that, kind of, what can we expect potentially here for workers' comp pricing going forward? Doug Elliot : Brian, it is extremely early, but the next 30 days, we jump into that season. So I think maybe one, maybe two states have hit in the last couple of days, but I don't have them pulled apart yet. But I do know over the next 30 to 60 days, most of the states will drop, and how this 2020 year is treated from a COVID perspective, both frequency. And then we've been quite transparent with our workers' comp selections around COVID. The same is not true for all of our competitors. So I don't have a great lens into everybody's reporting actions, but we'll learn more through the MCCI data. And as you know, I think they handled the bureau loss cost for 47 states. So that is a very big component of this country's workers' comp system. Brian Meredith : And then the second question, I'm just curious, so some good growth in Small Commercial. I mean, one of the things that people talk about is that if the economy reopens, it's really more beneficial for the E&S markets because new business formation typically doesn't fall in the standard Commercial Lines market. Is that a true statement? Or are we going to think about things in a little bit different way where you could really see some nice big growth in new businesses as we continue to see economic growth? Doug Elliot : Well, economic growth is a good thing for our business. And I would say that is probably partially true. I think it's true by sector. So our pricing algorithms and our underwriting decision points do look at geography. They look at class, they look at sectors of class. So there are new business start-ups that we're interested in writing on a retail basis. And then I would also say there are probably sectors of Small Commercial that better fit E&S. I think that it will be a good thing for our economic engine, and I'm glad you raised the point because we saw some of that in the second quarter, which is why we adjusted our audit premium going forward. But I don't feel like the real labor unlock has occurred yet, and I think that will provide a further spring in the second half. Brian Meredith : But Doug, you would also say that historically, in Small Commercial, we do have E&S offerings that we provide and that, obviously, Navigators is going to help us expand the product sets in a class of business that our two business leaders can partner on. So that's been part of the design to just capture more of small business needs, whether it be standard or in the E&S market? Doug Elliot : Absolutely, it's been a growing capability both, obviously, in our wholesale sector in Global Specialty, but also our Small Commercial business has a core strategy around working with wholesalers in that E&S space. I would also add, Brian, to your question, leadership and the people that run these businesses, so not all new start-ups are with first-time managers, right? Some of these new start-ups are with the experienced managers that we've known, we've insured in other places. So the start-up number can be a little misleading. And in general, we look at economic formation as a positive to our business. Operator : That was our last question for today. So I\u2019ll hand back to Susan to conclude. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Harry. We appreciate you all joining us this morning. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Once again, our outstanding underwriting capabilities and consistent execution on strategic initiatives becomes increasingly evident with each quarterly earnings report and reinforces my confidence about the future for the Hartford. In the third quarter, we reported core earnings of $442 million or $1.26 per diluted share. 8% growth in year-over-year diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 12.5%. We returned 634 million to shareholders in the quarter from share repurchases in common dividends, and 1.6 billion for the 9 months ended September 30th. The confidence we have in our business is also evidenced by the announcement that we have increased our share repurchase program by 500 million, bringing the total authorization to 3 billion through the end of 2022. And we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% payable in January of 2022. With strong cash flow generation, we will continue to have a balanced capital deployment approach to support growth and investments in the businesses with capital return to shareholders. Looking through to the underlying results, the positive momentum continued with written premium growth, margin expansion, operating efficiencies, and a significant return on alternative investments. However, results were impacted by Hurricane Ida, higher pandemic-related excess mortality and Group Benefits, and the Boy Scouts of America settlement. Commercial lines reported stellar margins with an industry-leading 87.2% underlying combined ratio in another double-digit top-line growth reflecting higher new business levels, continued strong retention, and solid renewal price increases. Our teams continue to execute exceptionally well. In personal lines. We're in the midst of a transformation to provide a more contemporary experience in product. Through a modernized platform in partnership with AARP, one of the largest affinity groups in America, we see the opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the mature market segment. With this demographic is expected to grow three times as fast as the rest of the U.S. population, over the next decade. I am pleased with the progress being made with the introduction of the new platform.  And Doug will provide more commentary. Additionally, in the quarter we entered into a new agreement in principle with the Boy Scouts of America. This agreement now includes not only the BSA, but local councils and representatives of the majority of sexual abuse claimants who have now been asked to officially vote on the BSA bankruptcy plan. The Hartford settlement becomes final upon the occurrence of certain conditions which we expect to occur in early 2022. Now turning to group benefits. Core earnings for the quarter were 19 million reflecting elevated life in short-term disability claims, partially offset by strong investment returns, improved long-term disability results, and earned premium growth.  Throughout the year, we have been reporting earned premium growth over prior year. In these quarters, positive trends continue. Fully insured ongoing premium is up 4%. This reflects growth in our in-force book and continued strong sales and persistency. Persistency was above 90% and increased approximately 1 point over prior year. The Group Life industry has been impacted by excess mortality over the past 6 quarters. During our July earnings calls, we were optimistic that trends would lead to an improvement in COVID related mortality. Our optimism was short-lived as the number of U.S. deaths started increasing in August due to the Delta variant and continued through September.  As of this week, U.S. COVID deaths for the third quarter, now exceed a 112,000. And this number is likely to continue to increase in the weeks ahead due to reporting lags in the data. The rapid increase in COVID deaths in the third quarter drove elevated mortality in our book of business and across the industry. Additionally, the mortality experienced from the Delta surge has a higher percentage impact on the under 65 population compared to prior periods. Approximately 40% of U.S. reported COVID deaths in August and September, were of individuals under age 65 compared to approximately 20% of COVID death in December of 2020 and January of 2021. Since younger age cohorts tend to carry higher face amounts, the combination of increased deaths and higher amounts of insured values resulted in a significant increase in total dollar levels of mortality claims. In addition, we experienced higher levels of non-COVID excess mortality during the quarter, representing approximately 30% of reported excess mortality loss. This is directionally consistent with the broader U.S. trends that saw elevated non-mortality in the third quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, forecasting excess mortality is a challenge. What we do know is that vaccinations are savings lives and higher levels of vaccination rates should help mitigate mortality claims. Bottom line, the fundamentals across the Group Benefits business remained solid and we are confident and optimistic about our performance in the future.  Turning to the economic backdrop, while there are conflicting signals, I remain encouraged on the '22 macroeconomic outlook and believe the environment will be one in which the Hartford's businesses performed well. Headline inflation remains elevated, but core inflation is on the decline. I do not expect inflationary pressures to go away overnight. The focus of global governments and the private sector on supply chain solutions as well as the normalization of hard-hit pandemic sectors, causes me to believe in inflationary pressure will begin to ease in the second half of 2022.  Well, employment gains stalled in the last couple of months as the U.S. was impacted by the Delta surge. Vaccination rates, therapeutics, and growing levels of natural immunity provide confidence that COVID will become less of a deterrent for individuals to seek employment and return to the workforce. Unemployment is expected to continue a downward trend as borders increasingly reopen and pandemic-related benefits fully roll-off. This bodes well for the Hartford 's business mix. As I reflect on my tenure with the Hartford, I am extremely proud of the progress we've made.  Over the years, we fixed core businesses, exited underperforming or non-core segments, successfully integrated the new operations we added. Positioning the Company to capture even more opportunities in the marketplace going forward. This is a direct result of our performance-driven culture and a significant investments we have made to transform the organization into one with exceptional underwriting tools and expertise, expanded product depth and breadth in industry leading digital capabilities, complemented by a talented and dedicated employee base. However, the journey is not complete. We will continue investing for the long term to become an even more differentiated competitor in the customer experience, all while producing superior financial results.  At our November 16th investor conference, I look forward to sharing how the business is positioned for continued out-performance, and highlighting the talented senior leadership team. With a high-quality franchise, growing revenues, strong margins, prudent capital management, I'm very confident that the Hartford has never been better positioned to continue to deliver on our financial objectives and enhance value for all stakeholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of 442 million or $1.26 per diluted share, reflect excellent investment results with a 40% annualized return on limited partnership investments and continued strong underlying results, offset by 300 million of catastrophe losses, 200 million from Hurricane Ida, and excess mortality of 212 million in Group Benefits. In TNC, the underlying combined ratio of 88.3 improved 2.3 points from the third quarter of 2020, highlighted by excellent performance in our commercial lines segment. In commercial lines, we produced an underlying combined ratio of 87.2, a 6.5-point improvement from the third quarter of 2020, and 15% written premium growth for the second consecutive quarter.  In personal lines an underlying combined ratio of 91.8 compares to 81.4 in the prior year quarter, which reflects higher auto claim frequency from increased miles driven in higher severity. Doug will provide more detail on these results in commercial and personal lines in a moment. P&C prior accident year reserve development within core earnings was a net unfavorable 62 million, driven by the new settlement agreement with BSA, partially offset by reserve reductions of $75 million, including decreases in workers compensation, personal auto liability, package, business, and bonds. In the quarter, we ceded an additional 28 million of Navigators reserve to the adverse development cover primarily related to wholesale construction. Although these losses are economically ceded, the reserve development resulted in a deferred gain representing a charge against net income in the quarter. Group Benefits core earnings of 19 million decreased from a 116 million in third quarter 2020, largely driven by higher excess mortality losses in Group Life, partially offset by increase in net investment income. All cause excess mortality in the quarter was 212 million before tax, which includes 233 million for third quarter deaths, offset by 21 million of net favorable development from prior periods, predominantly from the second quarter of 2021.  The percentage of excess mortality not specifically attributed to COVID -19 cause of loss is more significant this quarter than it has been in the past, and represents approximately 30% of the total. Excellent rocket from short-term disability related to COVID-19 and excess mortality, the core earnings margin was 12.6%. The underlying trends in disability remains positive, with lower long-term disability claim incidents and stronger recoveries related to prior-year reserves. The disability loss ratio in this year's quarter was 3.1 points higher as the prior-year loss ratio benefited from favorable short-term disability claim frequency due to fewer elective medical procedures during the early stages of the pandemic. As Chris commented, the incidence and excess mortality claims going forward is hard to predict as it is dependent on a number of factors, including the vaccination rate, the potential spread of new COVID variant. The percentage of those infected who are in the workforce, and the strain on the healthcare system impacting in the treatment of non-COVID related chronic illnesses. Improving operating efficiencies and a lower expense ratio from Hartford Next have contributed to margin expansion.  The programs delivered $306 million in pre -tax expense savings in the 9 months ended September 30th, 2021, compared to the same period in 2019. We continue to expect full-year pre -tax savings of approximately $540 million in 2022 and $625 million in 2023. Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings for the quarter were 58 million compared with 40 million for the prior-year period. Reflecting the impact of daily average AUM increasing 27%. Total AUM at September 30th was a 152 billion. Mutual fund net inflows were approximately 300 million compared with net outflows of 1.3 billion in third quarter 2020, Hartford Funds continues to produce excellent returns with growth and assets under management driven by net inflows and market appreciation.  As a low capital business it's return on equity has been outstanding, consistently over 45% since 2018. The corporate core loss was lower at 47 million compared to a loss of 57 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a $21 million before tax loss in Third Quarter 2020 from the equity interest in Talcott Resolution, which was sold earlier in 2021. Turning to investments, our investment portfolio delivered another outstanding quarter of results. Net investment income was 650 million up 32% from the prior-year quarter, benefiting from very strong annualized limited partnership returns of 40% driven by higher valuations and cash distributions within private equity funds and sales of underlying investments in real estate. Limited partnership returns, continue to exceed expectations.  We continue to manage the investment portfolio with a focus on high-quality public investments, while leveraging our capabilities to take advantage of attractive. private market opportunities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 3% before tax compared to 3.3% in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the lower interest rate environment. We expect pressure on the portfolio yield to continue in the fourth quarter. The portfolio credit quality remains strong with no credit losses on fixed maturities in the quarter.  Net realized gains on fixed maturities before tax for $2.5 billion at September 30th, down from $2.8 billion at June 30th due to higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI rose 8% since September 30th, 2020 to $49.64. And our trailing 12-month core earnings ROE was 12.5%. During the quarter, the Hartford returned $634 million to shareholders, including $511 million of share repurchases and $123 million in common dividends paid. Yesterday, the Board approved a 10% increase in the common dividend, an increase of share repurchase authorization by $500 million, With this increase and the $1.2 billion of repurchases completed through September 30th, there remained 1.8 billion of share repurchase authorization in effect through 2022.  From October 1st through October 27th, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million common shares for $108 million cash and investments at the holding Company were 2.1 billion as of September 30th, which includes the proceeds from the September issuance of 600 million of 2.9% senior notes. These proceeds will be used to repay our 600 million 7.875% junior subordinated debentures, which are redeemable at par on or after April 15th, 2022. During the third quarter, we received 443 million in dividends from subsidiaries and expect approximately 445 million in the fourth quarter. With top-line growth, improving underlying margins, operating efficiencies, strong cash flow, and ongoing capital management. We are positioned to consistently generate market-leading returns and enhance value creation for shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thanks, Beth and good morning everyone. Across property and casualty, I continue to be extremely pleased with our execution and performance. In the quarter, the underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 88.3. Commercial lines achieved double-digit written premium growth for the second consecutive quarter. Written pricing remains strong, largely consistent with second quarter. and our new personalized product launch is accelerating with 5 new states rolled out in October. As Beth mentioned, commercial lines produced a terrific underlying combined ratio of 87.2 with over 5 points of improvement coming from the loss ratio. and another point from expenses.  I've been doing these calls for a long time and this is one of the stronger underlying quarters I have presented. Before providing more color on commercial pricing and loss trends, let me spend a few minutes detailing another quarter of exceptional topline performance. Small commercial written premium of just over a billion was a third quarter record, increasing 14% over prior year. Policy count retention was strong at 84% and in-force policies grew 6% versus prior year. As anticipated, we continue to benefit from an improved economy with increases in payroll and wages contributing to the quarter's to-line result.  Small commercial new business of a $165 million was up 28%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Our workers compensation and market-leading  contributed equally to the result. I'm particularly pleased with the growth we're achieving across each of our small commercial distribution channels. New business from agents, payroll programs, alliances, and direct all delivered double-digit growth, and will meaningfully contribute to continued top-line performance. The breadth and depth of this distribution balance is unmatched by competitors. In middle large commercial, we produced a second consecutive excellent quarter with written premium growth of 18%. Middle-market new business of a 139 million was up 6% in the quarter, driven in large part by our industry verticals. Policy retention increased 8% or 8 points to 87%.  One of the strongest retention quarters in quite some time. We continue to balance the rate and retention trade-off, while maintaining disciplined risks underwriting, and leveraging our segmentation tools to drive profitable growth. Global Specialty produced another strong quarter with written premium growth of 14%. New business growth of 26% was equally impressive and retention remains strong in the mid-80s. In the quarter, the breadth of our written premium growth was led by 14% in wholesale and 19% in U.S. financial lines. Global Reinsurance also had an excellent quarter with written premium growth of 39%. Execution to fully leverage our expanded product portfolio these past 2 years has been excellent.  Across our franchise, we continue to further develop our operating routines with broader risk solutions to meet customer needs. As a proof point, third quarter cross-sell, new business premium between Global Specialty and middle and large commercial was $15 million. With this result, we have now exceeded our initial transaction goal of 200 million more than a year early. After years of development, our product portfolio has become a competitive strength and our execution will only get stronger. Let's move to pricing metrics. U.S. standard commercial lines pricing, excluding workers compensation was 6.5%, consistent with the second quarter. Middle-market ex-workers compensation price change of 8.1% was essentially flat to quarter 2 and continues to exceed loss cost trend.  In standard commercial workers compensation, renewal written pricing was in line with Quarter 2 at 1.2% Global Specialty renewal written price remains strong in the U.S. at 10% and international at 17%. Turning to commercial loss trends, our casually current equity year loss ratios are in line with expectations. It was a pretty quiet,  weather quarter in small commercial property. In addition, we continue to monitor the adverse impacts of supply chain disruptions on loss costs and expect property severity trends to be elevated for the rest of the year and into 2022. Earned pricing is still exceeding loss trends within most lines. And we remain confident in our full-year 2021 loss ratio expectations.  Before I move to personal lines, let me comment on the commercial pricing environment over the past 2 to 3 years. There's no question we've experienced a healthy pricing environment. And in several lines, one of the hardest markets I've experienced. The combination of these rate actions and disciplined underwriting decisions, are central drivers of our strong performance. Continued pressure from weather, supply chain, and inflation, leave me to believe that the current pricing environment will remain healthy well into 2022. Moving to personal lines, the third quarter underlying combine ratio rose 10.4 points to 91.8. Auto frequency is up with increasing vehicle trips and miles traveled, but still modestly below pre -pandemic levels.  Auto severity is elevated, driven in part by the rising cost of used cars, parts, and labor. These inflationary factors will continue to be an industry headwind as we expect them to persist into 2022. In home, we continue to experience favorable frequency versus our initial expectations. More than offsetting higher claims severity from elevated building material and labor costs. Turning to the topline, written premium declined 2%. Policy retention was relatively stable at 84% and new business premium was up 6% in the quarter.  This new business uptick occurred despite JD Power survey results concluding that auto insurance shopping rates among the 50 plus age segment remain 6% below a year ago. Our new business growth was driven by higher marketing spend and improved conversion rates. I'm pleased with this quarter's momentum. We're also encouraged by the early results from the launch of our new contemporary Personal Lines auto and home product prevail. Through the third quarter, written premium, responses and issue accounts are exceeding expectations. Both products are now available in 7 states. With our latest launch in early October, we also enhanced our Auto and Home bundling and telematics capabilities.  On the latter, we're excited to be partnering with the industry leader, Cambridge Mobile Telematics. This is an important change as we continue to augment our models based on driving behavior. The prevail product will be into more states over the next 90 days. Before turning the call back to Susan for Q&A, let me conclude with a few final thoughts. Property and casualty had an incredible quarter. Our commercial top line produced a second consecutive quarter of superior performance. Strong pricing is earning into the book driving lower current  year loss ratios.  Global Specialty is delivering strong execution and underwriting performance, and we continue to be excited about the launch of prevail and personal lines. We're clearly seeing the positive results of our multi-year roadmap with deeper and broader products, improved risk selection, and outstanding execution. This quarter is another demonstration of those capabilities. Our technology invest agenda has been significant and the results are clear and sustainable. I'm thrilled with our continued progress and look forward to sharing more details with our business heads in the November at Investor Day. Let me now turn the call back over to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thank you. Will now take questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roost. Our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the incremental side, magic millions of buybacks. I know it's a 2-year capital plan. So is that expected to come this year or next year? And then is that being funded just with higher dividend for HoldCo or are you holding a little bit less of a buffer or maybe a combination of both? Chris Swift : Elyse, I'll start and then I'll ask Beth to add her commentary. As we sit here today, it's a sign of obviously increased confidence in our business performance. Our cash-generation, capabilities coming out of our Opcos that will eventually flow to the holding Company. We haven't relaxed any of our standards as far as our HoldCo liquidity, we still want to hold generally 1 times interest in -- the future interest in dividends. But it's more, as we sit here today and look at the performance of our businesses here in '21 heading into '22, we're highly confident in their performance and we took the action we did, but Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes. What I would add is, as we think about the timing of the share repurchases, as you recall, under the 2.5 billion authorization, we had said that we anticipated a billion 5 in '21, with a billion in 2022. So increasing by 500 million Susan Spivak : gives us the opportunity in 22 to be relatively consistent with 21. So we're not looking to significantly change the timing of what we had already laid out for 21. But again, as Chris said, as we look at underlying business performance and levels of capital at the holding Company, we felt this was the appropriate actions. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question on within your absolute year, underlying loss ratio improvement within commercial. How much pain rate and trend are within your commercial book? And then can you update us on what you're assuming for Wasz trend across your commercial book and has that changed recently? Doug Elliot : Shirley, let me start, and Beth will fill around the edges for sure. As I mentioned, over 5 points of commercial loss improvement, you've got to adjust for COVID. So COVID is a point and a half of that change year-over-year. But then across our core lines, essentially, all of our lines are earning in positive rate. And so as I think about that, the adjustments and the variables that drive those changes are all coming from that positive current rate change, so I think it's sustainable as we look into the fourth quarter. We had a little bit good news on non-cap weather property primarily in small commercial, but the other lines CompGL, our specialty lines it's basically earn rate driving the improvement. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the call. Operator : Our next question will come from Derek Han with KBW. Please go ahead. Derek Han : Good morning. Thanks. My first question is on workers comp. One of your competitors talked about the competitive environment. Kind of driving rates to now really inflect until year-end 2022. Can you just talk about what kind of frequency and severity trends that you're seeing with wage inflation and the potential for medical inflation to pick up as well? Doug Elliot : A few pieces to that question. I'd start by saying that the competitor environment as, into quarter 3 into 4 not a lot different than what we saw earlier part of the year. So I think a fairly consistent competitive environment. The comment about the 22 extension towards the end of the year, I think is a fair comment that we see based on the filings that are moving through state regulatory bodies now, do think we're looking towards the end of '22 to see a turn towards that positive sign that people have been expecting now for a couple of years.  I will remind you that our performance in these lines across our businesses, particularly small, excellent, so our workers comp performance continues to perform. And then relative to trends, yes, the long-term trend of frequency, favorable variances, we expect long-term to continue. We had a little bit of a period that will be unlike any other period prior because of pandemic. And yes, medical inflation has been rather tame the last couple of years, but our long-term expectations have not come off, right, which are in that five plus range for medical inflation, we see that long - term and we've not adjusted our fix because of that expectation. Derek Han : Okay. That's really helpful. And then my second question is on the reserves. How are you feeling about the navigator's reserves? Given that your quarter away from maybe blowing through the top of the adverse cover. It looks like you had $400 million in adverse to loan there over the last few years. Chris Swift : Derica, I'll start and just remind you that we purchased that adverse loss to recover for a reason. And it was part of our views of how we're going to finance the acquisition that again, I think turns out to be an absolute homerun as you heard from Doug, the improvement in our combined ratios, the improvement in product, the ability to cross-sell, all those additional capabilities that are now in the house. I think is tremendous. So again it was part of how we view that we were going to finance it and obviously it takes some tail risk off, but Beth what would you add? Beth Costello : As I mentioned, the changes that we made this quarter were in  wholesale construction and and really just increase some of the tail factors that we had in that book. And overall, when I think about the navigator\u2019s reserve and even think of the action that we took this quarter, with or without the ADC, relatively small movement when you think about the overall balance sheet and reserves that we have. Derek Han : Got it. I appreciate all the color. Operator : Our next question will come from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Gary Ransom : Good morning. Regarding the aggregate cap reinsurance cover, I was wondering if you could help us understand where you are in terms of reaching the attachment point and how that might affect fourth quarter or limit for? Beth Costello : Yeah. Gary, great question. So yes, we do have an aggregate cover that kicks in when losses that get seeing that cover exceeds $700 million and provides $200 million of protection. And so when you look at the cap losses that we've had through September 30th, we probably have about little less than $50 million to go, before we would start to hit that $700 million attachment point. Gary Ransom : All right. Thank you very much. And then what leaves us  probably for Doug on this. The tourism market and how rates are worldwide stabilizing. If I compare how I was thinking about it, maybe even you were thinking about it earlier in the year that we will see some deceleration of those rates. It's actually seeming to have leveled out a bit more and there may be a lot of different factors involved in that. But do you have a view on what is causing that? And I assume that's part of the reason you think it's flowing into 22 or deeper into 22. Doug Elliot : Gary, I agree with you, right, so far. Looking at the core of our guaranteed cost non-specialty book, I would describe Q3 as very stable compared to earlier in the year and within our expectations, for the reasons you suggest. We look at property drivers and the weather. We think about the inflation risk, supply chain. I mentioned them in my script. I think that those types of factors will be further drivers to make sure that we, as underwriters, are covering our cost of a risk. And so that would be my commentary around the core-guaranteed cost, non-specialty book. And then in the Specialty area, where we've seen rather dramatic changes in the pricing, the last couple of  dramatic in the sense of positive. Yes, there's been some moderation, but I think as correlating to improve price adequacy in those books of business in those particular lines. So I think in total, not major surprises, but I do think these threat factors are relative to particularly whether in the property area and supply chain and others will keep prices where they are. We see a steady as you go for a period of time now. Gary Ransom : All right, that's helpful. Thank you. Doug Elliot : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much. Still, I'm looking at the growth rate in Global Re and internationally. Now, when you talked about the navigator\u2019s acquisition, you want to increase your shelf space and a lot of your producing agents and whatnot, but international and Global Re kind of fall out of the firewall, having a complete shelf of products. What are the strategies in those 2 sub-segments? But what do you hope to achieve and how does this fit in with your business model? Doug Elliot : I'd start with Global RE, it's really a niche segment for us. It's a small group of very seasoned thoughtful underwriters selective in their portfolio matching. This is a smaller quarter for them, so the 39 you have to put in context, but it's been a successful group. They have added to our risk expertise here within the place. And we're very pleased about their approach and their success. So I see them very much a part of our strategy, but a little bit separate from our primary focus on Global RE.  And then relative to international, our stated mission the first couple of years, was absolutely to regain our contribution to shareholder success, if you are right. We have had a very disappointing couple of years of performance internationally. Not unlike others in the  marketplace. And so we've worked hard at that and now feel much better about our financial performance. And as we look forward, we're exploring and debating amongst ourselves about how we grow that portfolio. So I'm bullish about the future.  Really pleased that we have the past behind us and I think we have a very solid platform to work from. And obviously it is a specialty platform. Not unlike most of our competitors in the Lloyd's marketplace, but we were talking across our product families about what we can do there. And I think an area that we'll talk more to you about over time. Josh Shanker : All right. And then on personal lines. Obviously, it's a real tough period for auto right now with the reopening and used car prices. How should I think about the loss ratio content on new business being  under the new underwriting model, where you're not stuck with the business compared to the previous relationship with AARP, where you kind of hand to be sure, order pick up a customer. Should the new business have a lower loss ratio than the legacy business or a higher loss ratio? Doug Elliot : Well, I would start by answering your question saying, we have spent a lot of time with our pricing approach state-by-state as we've launched these new products, and probably slightly different answers, bi-state based on where we are and what we see as the opportunities in the given states. So I would not jump to the fact that we see and expect lower loss ratios in the new than we do in our current book. We have a very solid season book that continues to season out. And over time, that has been and will continue to be a significant contributor to our earnings, but we're excited about what we can do with this new product platform. It is much more contemporary; it\u2019s got features as underwriters we like a lot.  And obviously I've talked to you about what we're doing with the auto space, with our Telematics program. So, as I think about the new launch of prevail in time that will continue to be a key driver of our profits. That will be increasing as we roll through the rest of the country in 2022 with rollouts. At the moment, it's rather immature and we're watching the early stage and so I think it's too early to call, but excited about early progress. Josh Shanker : And that's -- Chris Swift : Josh, it's Chris. Josh Shanker : -- Yeah. Chris Swift : And again, Doug described it well. I will just add. Again, remember part of the inherent strategy there is to serve AARP members in the 50's, particularly in the 50- to 65-year-old. So our base plans, our base rates in the various states that we do expect a broader population set to underwrite. But again, given the flexibility we have with 6 months policies, no lifetime continuity agreements, meaning they're not guaranteed renewable. Is it does give us I think added flexibility, to experiment in various class -- various states. Josh Shanker : And is the new product, direct or multi-channel? Chris Swift : It's direct right AARP dedicated. I mean, you've seen our agency business, it's very small compared to where it was years ago, but this is our direct inter-consumer channel. Josh Shanker : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Zirinski with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mike Zirinski : Great. Happy Friday. Good morning. I guess just sticking out as a follow-up to Josh's questions, since your portfolio mix is still a little different than many it appears we follow in terms of demographics. And your results in auto are still good. Just curious, are you looking to push a lot more rate there or is it given the inflationary trends or how should we think about kind of rate versus potential loss trend over the coming year or so? I think in your commentary, it sounds like we should be baking in some continued pressure. Doug Elliot : Mike, that's fair. I would say that we are satisfied with our financial return in that business. Very solid rate adequacies. basically strong across-the-board. But we're not immune from the risks in supply chain and used auto prices, etc., that the industry is facing. So we are active on the pricing front. We are working state-by-state across the country. We have more flexibility as Chris enumerated relative to prevail. But even in our current product construct, I would say it's an active product area upstairs working. What we think are the supply chain issues that we're going to be facing into 2022 as we work through that here. So yes, active on the actuarial front. Mike Zirinski : Okay, great. Switching gears, maybe just kind of to workers comp and maybe stepping back to see the forest for the trees a bit so. Some investors have focused on kind of the soft pricing environment for a while which might be improving. But I guess workers comp results have really been excellent. It looks like much better than expected for years now, despite the pricing, maybe you can kind of talk to what's been driving the loss cost trends. What specifically has been much better than expected over the over the recent years, especially for some of the older vintages? Doug Elliot : I can't give you all of our secret sauce away. That would be a good day for other people listening, but I will share this with you. We have a very sophisticated shares of pricing modules across our markets. I think we work -- workers compensation and think about strategy and think about segmentation in deep geographic cells, industry cells, etc. So what we do down in the valves of our business, really strong fundamentals relative to workers Doug Elliot : compensation. I will share with you and, you know this well that the trends have been rather moderate over the past 5 to 6 years, right? So understanding that, as we talked before, medical severity has been pretty moderate these last 3 to 5 years. Generally, the long-term frequency numbers are in good shape, but our performance has, I would say, exceeded those tailwinds. And when I think about our execution on the frontlines and the combination of our data science, data analytics inside this Company, the use of third-party data. There's just a lot of competitors strength that we think drive our success in workers' comp. And I think those are here for the long term and getting better every quarter. Chris Swift : Doug again, I know we talked about it internally. I would just add, Mike, our ability to interface with our agents and brokers in a just a more efficient way these days, given our digital capabilities that we've built. I think does provide a competitive advantage for agents or other forms of distributions to interact with us on an easier basis with great data fast turnaround time. So the competitive advantage that Doug talked about from the analytical side, I think is equally matched with our go-to-market digital capabilities. Operator : Our next question will come from Tracy M GT for the Barclays. Please go ahead. Tracy M : Thank you. Good morning. Your underlying margin expansion in commercial lines is quite impressive and I appreciate the color of earned rate, ahead of trend. Just another question there. Could you comment on the direction of your 2021 access year loss pick. How does that compare to 2020 and your 5-year out rates? Doug Elliot : So Tracy, let me start our -- when we think about current actual year picks and maybe just refer you to the supplement because we've got a year-to-date in the supplement. Our numbers underlying on the loss side are really strong. So if you look at nine months of '21 versus nine months of '20, I think they're very healthy and that really does guide back to the thoughts of Beth has shared a bit ago about stronger in pricing as a result of written pricing in 2020 and 2021. So we're encouraged.  The other thing that we have not talked about on the call this morning. There's still a number of actions we're taking relative to segmentation and industry focus, across our businesses that are contributing to that number. So I know in our mill and large commercial book Moore Tucker and his team have a number of initiatives that are also drivers of improving performance. So, a lot is of happening in the core underwriting, but some of those drivers are, in addition to what I would describe, very positive pricing trends. Chris Swift : I would add just to Tracy 's comment. There's nothing fundamentally that's changed in our philosophy of how we'd like to be thoughtful, predictable, consistent with loss picks, with anything related to our business. So Tracy, I mean, we have a great deal of pride in being very consistent and predictable. So that's the only color I would add. Yeah. Doug Elliot : I would agree with that, Chris and maybe just as a closure, in two weeks when we're together on Investor Day, one of the initiatives of that day is to take you inside and to give you a sense of how different our competing engine is today than it was five years ago. And there are a lot of things we've done organically, which we will highlight on the 16th. And there are things that we've been able to do with the addition of some more product on the Specialty side. So it's hard, I know we go quarter-to-quarter with you folks. We're going to attempt to spend some time in the 16th to look back, and give you a sense of why our optimism is as strong as it is, with our Company going forward. Tracy M : Looking forward to seeing that journey in Investor Day. I also will follow up on the auto pricing front comments. I guess in those efforts with rate filing, I just want to get a better sense of when you think earn rate will be needing higher loss trend in those efforts. Would we see that inflection point next year in 2022 or 2023? Doug Elliot : Tracy well, . Thanks. Is that a commercial or personal lines comment? Tracy M : Personal audit. But I just understand there's a delay with some regulator and actually getting those filings through since it wasn't that long ago they were thinking about rebate. Just that process of getting the rate filings improved and in the meantime, you just have accumulation of loss trend. So I just wanted to know when you think that will all come together. Doug Elliot : Yeah. So the executive date is going to be hard to predict, but let me just start with where we were 15 months ago. One of the things we did not do, was to tinker with our new business pricing in the second quarter of 2020. So when we return money to customers, we did that based on kind of an in-force rate of return and did not change our appetite or our pricing a new going forward. I think that has provided a much more stable, profitable base that is not changed but we obviously, because of driving habits changing radically in the second quarter of 2020, we return money is appropriately given that.  But I'd start with the premise that our book remains intact and feeling very healthy about it. Second point I'd make is that to answer that question, you'd have to talk about and predict the supply chain dynamic. And that is very difficult to do, right? So we suggested, we think some of the Kingston supply, the pressures we're feeling, the labor dynamic, unemployment, etc. are all feeding into this. We think those trends will continue in to '22. I hope they will ease as we get into the middle part of '22, but that is an ongoing component. And then lastly, really is a state-by-state dynamics. So it's so hard for me to suggest, we look across our states, some states that we're filing in the next 30 days or some states we have filed in the last 100 days that we won't be filing for another 3, 6 months. So it is a very active process and we do think supply chain will ease a bit, but we don't think that will happen in the short-term, so we expect to kind of live on through the current conditions as we see them and as we move into the latter half of '22, we'll get to a better spot. Tracy M : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew Kligerman : Good morning. Question around -- well, first great to see the repurchase authorization go up, but also curious with the M&A environment. Are you seeing any opportunities, any areas where you'd like to get bigger? Could that eventually preclude some of this upward authorization? What are you thinking about M&A and how that might play out over the next 2 years? Chris Swift : Andrew, thanks for the question. Yeah. We've -- I think been pretty consistent of late that -- it's just a low priority, principally because I think our portfolio of capabilities, products, is robust and we want to mature that, grow at organically and focus on the activities more from an organic mindset as opposed to M&A. So I just consistently shared with you and others it\u2019s just a low priority, and that's why, again, where we feel inappropriate to make a repurchase commitment through the end of '22 with that $500 million increase. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks, Chris. And then just moving over to the Group Benefits business. Looks like you had a real solid on ongoing premiums growth of 4% in the third quarter. It seems to be steadily moving up. What products are driving that you've seen movement in voluntary products and can you sustain that growth rate because it's very compelling if we could just get out of the COVID and just continue to see these really nice underlying benefits ratios? Doug Elliot : I believe we can, Andrew. We've I think demonstrated that consistently during the year as we have been recovering from COVID. So I think the opportunity, particularly as more people come back into full-time employment or part-time employment, with a little wage inflation that's occurring in most industries. I think that sets up well and as I was trying to say in my commentary that the environment for Group Benefits broadly defined is very healthy. Our highest growing product line is our voluntary product set that we've built over the last five years.  So we are really pleased with all the critical illness hospital SAP products that we have at our disposal now. So that is a deep growth area. And then I would just give you one last point, Andrew. I think people's attitudes, meaning employees attitude to benefits has changed. I think they're more focused on it, given what we're living through. I think they're more thoughtful about thinking about risk and protection they need for themselves or their families. So I think there's a broad awakening of benefit type products and voluntary products that is occurring across America. Andrew Kligerman : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar : I had a couple of questions both on workers comp and I think first on pricing and workers comp. Everyone's been expecting prices to go up next year for the last couple of years, but hasn't happened yet. And wondering if you could comment on is that because of competitor behavior or is it because the pushback from the state? And what gives you the confidence that things might actually turn at some point in 2022? Doug Elliot : Jimmy, so I'd start by saying that the overall performance line is pretty solid. And that would be my place to start. Secondly, you now have a COVID year entering its way into most dates its three-year experience period. So actually year 20 is now becoming part of the experience period and actually year 20 has a period of time relative to frequency where people were home and frequency rates were very favorable. So with that entry into the experience period, we're going to see some downward pressure on pricing. That is why the later in '22 toward the end of the year into '23, we're going to feel those headwinds in workers comp, and I think others have talked about it, but it's just where the market is right now and why I'm so pleased that our performance continues to be strong. And we will make sure that we're working for labors that we have here to be thoughtful about our underwriting and risk taking throughout '22. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. And then as you think about margins and workers comp, I think in the past, there have been cases when the economy is running pretty hard. You see a pick up and losses. Sometimes it doesn't seem like that's happened this time around. But if you could comment on what you've seen in that respect and whether that's a concern as you're looking at the economy, overall. Doug Elliot : We're certainly watching that carefully or watching frequency because just as you described, sometimes when you see a pickup in the economy, you'll have less experienced workers on the job that may lead to injuries and injuries obviously are a driver in worker's compensation. So as I reflected both in the second quarter and third quarter are frequencies are in healthy shape, but it is a high watch item for us. And if we see something we will, we will share that with you and deal with that in our numbers. But right now, fairly quiet. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. And just lastly, on the group business, on the non COVID mortality being high, you could talk about whether you think that's more of an anomaly or could that be a trend given that more younger people are being affected overall, which obviously affects your book more so than was the case initially. Doug Elliot : Jimmy, the non - COVID mortality has been very bouncy over the last 6 quarters. So I don't see a trend per se just given what we've seen in the data. I think the anecdotal view is during COVID, particularly the early days, there might have been lack of people seeing their health care providers for routine healthcare, whether it be annual physicals, normal checks and screenings. We have seen, particularly in this quarter, when we're with that elevated non - COVID mortality, little bit more heart stroke cancer causes of death that seem to indicate maybe a second order effect with COVID and people not taking care of themselves. But beyond that, it's been very bouncy. That's all I'll say, so I don't think it's trend able at this point. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and allowing the call to go a little longer. I wanted to also just ask about the group benefits, the adverse mortality this quarter. I was wondering if you could just give a break down how much of it was IBNR versus actual reported deaths in the third quarter. And then relate it with, and I know there's a lot of uncertainty here. It's hard to predict. But as of now, the  estimates that total COVID mortality will remain near a 100,000 deaths in the fourth quarter. If it does, in fact, stay that high, would you expect similar sensitivity as in 3Q, or I guess how should we think about the puts and takes there? Chris Swift : Happy to take your question, David. It's important to get you and Tom some answers. So let me just give you a context on sort of mortality here. How we approach it is, obviously, we have a great deal of data and history in this area that sort of complete our lag studies to make an estimate of sort of incurred but not reported debts during the quarter. Obviously, with the COVID happening, we've overlaid CDC data into our analysis to obviously see their trends both on a COVID and non - COVID factor.  So that's the blending of those two came up in essence with our conclusion for this quarter. At the end of the quarter, I would share with you, July was fairly developed, meaning you could have a higher degree of confidence on the ultimate\u2019s that we see in July. A little less so in August and September is the freshest month and that's the one that's the most challenged to sort of predict the future. When you put it all together, though, for the quarter of the incurred losses that we have, 53% of it is still held in IBNR. Chris Swift : So if that's the data point you are looking for, I think the other point that you referenced is I would share with you the more desks and under 65-year-old is really driving up our severity. And if you look at severity on a 9-month basis this year compared to 9-month basis last year. Our severity is there up 49%, which tells us, again, younger age cohorts, higher insured value, active lives at work. When we look at sort of regions, in the region that sort of stands out for us is the Southeast. Yeah. They are experiencing the most elevated from historical expectation side. So as you say, the fourth quarter.  Actually it's got some data out there, there's a lot of data out there. I would just share with you and all my years in the life business. It's been most difficult to get our arms around a model that really effectively predicts this. Some models are high, some are low. You've seen our experienced even this year where first quarter we were significantly overestimated on our IBNR. So I'm going to refrain from making any predictions both on frequency and severity because there's a wide range of outcomes. What I would share though is that we do have some FD friendly events coming up in December and we'll provide our analysts and investors a view of where we see fourth quarter mortality going.  You might even ask, what about 22? '22 is even harder to predict. So when we're back together in February, we'll give you our best thinking, but as we sit here today, I think these next two quarters could still have some lingering quota effects that will emerge in everyone's numbers. David Motemaden : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate that detail. And totally understand there is a lot of uncertainty and you're not alone in terms of predicting the impact, obviously, so. If I could just switch gears and sneak one more in for Doug. I just wanted to ask. It looks like, in small commercial, you talked about underlying loss ratios, ex-COVID, actually improving. Could you talk about the drivers there because I had thought that was a place where pricing was under a little bit more pressure. So is that more a benefit of just wage inflation coming through or something else? Doug Elliot : I think about small commercial year-over-year in the quarter. I mentioned we had a pretty good non-cat quarter, weather quarter, so. We have some good news in loss ratio there and then yes to your question on workers comp our experience has been favorable there. We're slightly outperforming our expectations around pricing in small. So that's against our -- where we thought we would be through the third quarter. Obviously, that's in the books right now. But in general I still feel good about our calls.  We've not come off our severity calls, our indemnity calls, and encouraged by what we see in the performance of the line. So I don't think there's a major story there, but it's just another really solid performance by our small commercial Company. David Motemaden : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Matt.

Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. In 2021, The Hartford delivered strong financial performance across the organization as we continued to execute on our strategy, we realize the growing benefits of investing in our businesses. At our Investor Day in November, we shared our roadmap for maximizing shareholder value and demonstrated how we are executing in a more consistent and sustainable way. Our targeted priorities will continue to produce results that drive profitable growth, enable market leading ROEs and deliver consistent capital generation, while at the same time sustaining our top quartile ESG performance. As evidence of our ability to drive profitable growth, core earnings were up 10% in the fourth quarter to $697 million and full year core earnings grew to $2.2 billion. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was up 8% from year end 2020 and the core earnings ROE of 12.7% for the second consecutive year. During the quarter, we also returned $620 million to shareholders from share repurchases and common dividend, bringing total capital return for 2021 to $2.2 billion. These strong results are the product of an extremely attractive portfolio of businesses in target investments over last several years to generate strong sustainable cash flow. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize investments for future organic growth, along with dividends and share repurchases in our capital allocation decisions. The Hartford's businesses have distinct advantages of their own and complement each other extremely well, sharing deep underwriting and risk management expertise, tools, insights and distribution across the portfolio of businesses, we will continue to invest in claims, analytics, data science, and digital capabilities to ensure superior performance. All the businesses possess exceptional talent that fully embrace the Hartford's winning behaviors and passion for execution. I am incredibly proud of the resiliency demonstrated by our team, especially over the last 2 years. This speaks to our character, focus on continuous improvement, and commitment to all our stakeholders. Let's now turn to highlights from the quarter, which illustrate how our business strategy translates into financial performance. In commercial lines, the positive momentum continued with stellar margins in double-digit top line growth, reflecting higher new business levels, continued strong retention and solid renewal price increases. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect strong growth and earn pricing to continue to exceed loss cost trends in most lines, resulting in further margin improvement. Personal lines delivered solid operating performance in a dynamic market environment. I am pleased with the progress being made as we advance the rollout of our new Prevail product and platform that provides a more contemporary experience to our unique AARP customers in the 50 plus age segment. We are closely watching the impact of inflation on loss costs and responding with underwriting and pricing actions. We anticipate slightly higher underlying combined ratio in 2022. Turning to group benefits, earnings continue to be impacted by the ongoing pandemic with elevated life and disability claims. Despite pandemic headwinds, performance across group benefits remain solid and key business metrics demonstrate our market leadership position. Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% in the quarter, reflecting increased sales as well as growth in new premium from existing customers. Persistency was about 90% and increased one point over prior year. In 2021, our sales growth benefited from the initial expansion of paid family medical leave in several states. Adjusting for that one-time lift, we are off to a good start with January 22 sales being on par with prior year. For the full year, we are expecting premium growth in the 2% range compared to 2021. Within our long-term disability book, claim recoveries remain strong. Claim incidents and short-term disability is highly elevated due to COVID, while long-term disability incidence rates have shown modest signs of increases as we have been experiencing, and in turn will be incorporated into future pricing assumptions. The Omicron variant has driven the most recent surge in cases. Initial effects of Omicron are more impactful for short-term disability, but the lag between infection and death makes it challenging to predict future mortality. Estimates of expected cases vary widely as do perspectives on the final resolution of COVID as an endemic virus. For 2022, we are estimating between $125 million and $225 million of pre-tax losses due to the broad effects of the pandemic, including short-term disability and excess mortality, which we expect to impact results primarily in the first part of the year. Our excess mortality estimates are based on the best data we can gather regarding COVID trends and reflect our optimism for the remainder of the year. This optimism is principally due to the population continuing to get boosted and the Omicron being less lethal. In addition, as advanced therapeutics make their way to the market and into the hands of the medical community, there is an expectation of fewer deaths for those who contract the virus. Though uncertainty remains, I am encouraged as we progress through 2022, the pandemic will shift to a regional endemic state with more treatment options available. Excluding any pandemic related effects for both life and disability, we expect the core earning margins to be between 6% and 7% consistent with our long-term margin outlook for this business. Turning to the macroeconomic environment for 2022. I am optimistic the business environment will be one in which the Hartford will prosper. We expect that consumer capacity to spend will remain strong, which will drive economic growth. The U.S unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9% and is likely to fall below pre-pandemic levels of 3.5% at year-end and we are seeing signs of increases to workforce participation. In 2022, we expect inflation to be challenging in the first half of the year. However, as supply chains gradually improve, consumption, transitions from goods to services, and interest rates rise, we believe core inflation in the second half of the year will decline to the 3% range. Lower unemployment and mid-single-digit GDP growth is supportive of our employment centric workers' compensation and group benefits businesses. An expanding economy is also a catalyst for growth across commercial lines, particularly in Small Commercial with higher new business formation. While monetary policy normalization may lead to volatility in the capital markets, our well diversified and high-quality investment portfolio is constructed to withstand this market dynamic. With a favorable macroeconomic backdrop, profitable growth, expanding margins in P&C and group benefits and proactive capital management, we are well-positioned based on our current pandemic assumptions to generate a 13% to 14% core earnings ROE in 2022 and continuing into 2023. Before I close, I want to speak to our ESG achievements and our commitment going forward. We have been consistently recognized for our efforts and progress setting us apart from our competitors. Most recently, the Hartford was named the number one insurer and 14th overall on America's Most JUST Companies list. The recognition we continue to receive is a testament to our long-standing commitment to sustainability and the dedication and hard work of our teams that make these priorities core to who we are. ESG leadership remains a critical component of our value creation strategy as we continue to deliver strong financial results alongside positive outcomes for all stakeholders. In closing, we begin 2022 in a very strong competitive position with sustainable advantages and a winning formula to consistently achieve superior risk adjusted returns. This a direct result of our performance driven culture and the significant investments we have made to transform the organization into one with exceptional underwriting tools and expertise, expanded product depth and breadth and industry-leading digital capabilities, complemented by a talented and dedicated employee base. We will continue investing for the long-term to become an even more differentiated competitor, all while producing financial results. I am confident that the Hartford has never been in a better position to continue to deliver on our financial objectives and enhance value for all stakeholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of $697 million or $2.02 per diluted share reflects strong P&C underwriting results and a significant contribution from investments, partially offset by the continued impacts of the pandemic and group benefits. Commercial lines reported 14% written premium growth in the quarter, reflecting an increase in new business, strong policy retention and exposure growth. The underlying combined ratio of 88.9, improved 1.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2020 due to lower COVID losses and improvement in the loss ratios and Global Specialty workers' compensation and property. In Personal lines, the underlying combined ratio of 95.9 includes the effect of an increase in auto claims frequency and severity. New business premiums grew 16% with increases in both hot auto and homeowners. P&C current accident year catastrophes in fourth quarter were $22 million before tax, which is net of reinsurance recoveries of $39 million under our aggregate catastrophe cover. As a reminder, this cover attaches once qualifying cat losses exceed $700 million. As it relates to our cat reinsurance program, we renewed the program on January 1, 2022, at only a modest increase in cost with no changes in structure. We've included a summary of our program in the earnings slide presentation. P&C prior accident year reserve development with in core earnings was a net favorable $144 million, driven by a decrease in reserves for workers' compensation, catastrophes, package business and personal auto liability, partially offset by adverse Navigators reserve development. In total for the quarter, we incurred $43 million of adverse reserve development subject to the adverse development cover, of which $18 million was ceded to the cover. We have cumulatively ceded $300 million of losses the coverage limit under the treaty. Outside of core earnings, we also recognize adverse development of $155 million before tax for asbestos and environmental with $106 million for asbestos and $49 million for environmental. During this year's reserve study, we saw a decline in asbestos claim filing frequency, which was more than offset by an increase in defense costs and claims settlement rates and values. For environmental, the reserve increase was primarily due to the settlement of a large legacy coal ash remediation claim, an increase in legal defense costs and higher site remediation costs. While the $155 million of reserve development was economically seated under the adverse development cover, we took a charge to that income for the deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance. To date, we have ceded a little over $1 billion to the adverse development cover with $485 million of limit remaining. Turning to group benefits. The core loss of $12 million compared to core earnings of $49 million in fourth quarter 2020. The core loss reflects continued elevated excess mortality losses in group life, higher short-term and long-term disability claim incidents and increasing the expense ratio. When we shared our third quarter results, the reported U.S COVID death rate had started to decline from the August surge. Unfortunately, the decline was short lived as the death rate ticked up again in December. Using CDC reported COVID deaths, we currently estimate U.S deaths for the fourth quarter will be about 126,000, just slightly higher than 124,000 deaths for third quarter. The death rate for those under age 65 is down slightly, but still higher than the first quarter of 2021. Our estimates for all-cause excess mortality in the quarter is $161 million before tax, compared to $152 million in the prior year quarter. The $161 million included $176 million with dates of loss in the fourth quarter, partially offset by favorable development on prior quarters. The disability loss ratio was elevated 6.5 points over the prior year due to higher claim incidents levels for both long-term and short-term disability. In the quarter, we increased our 2021 long-term disability accident year estimate to reflect modest increases in claim activity. Additionally, short-term disability claims in the quarter were elevated due to COVID and we did not experience a corresponding decrease in non-COVID claims as we did earlier in the pandemic. When adjusting for excess mortality and COVID related short-term disability impacts, the core earnings margin was 7.8%. Lastly, the expense ratio for group benefits increased by 1.7 points compared to the prior fourth quarter. The expense ratio was impacted by higher compensation costs, an increase in technology costs and higher staffing costs to handle elevated claims. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2020 benefited from a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Partially offsetting these expense increases were incremental Hartford net expense savings and the effect of earned premium growth. Hartford Funds core earnings for the quarter were $60 million compared with $46 million for the prior year period, reflecting the impact of daily average AUM increasing 20%. Total AUM at December 31 was a $158 billion. Mutual fund net inflows are positive for the 5th consecutive quarters of $358 million. The corporate core loss of $41 million compared to a loss of $51 million in the prior year quarter. The lower core loss was primarily due to an increase in net investment income related to a higher level of dividends received on equity funds. Across the enterprise, we continue to execute on our Hartford Max operational transformation and cost reduction plan, achieving $423 million of expense savings through year-end 2021. We remain on schedule to achieve savings of $540 million in 2022 and $625 million in 2023. Turning to investments, our portfolio delivered another outstanding quarter. Net investment income was $573 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from very strong annualized limited partnership returns of 22%, mostly driven by private equity funds. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 3.1% before tax for the fourth quarter and the full year. Looking forward to 2022, we would expect our total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships, will be slightly lower than in 2021 as the reinvestment rate continues to be low below the average sales and maturity yield on the portfolio, as well as an expected reduction in returns within the equity portfolio and non-routine income items such as make-whole payments. The portfolio credit quality remains strong with no credit losses on fixed maturities in the quarter. The unrealized gains on fixed maturities before tax was $2.1 billion at December 31, down from $2.5 billion at September 30, due to marginally higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. The value per diluted share excluding AOCI was 8% since December 31, 2020 to $50.86 and the trailing 12 months core earnings ROE with 12.7%. During the quarter, the Hartford returned $620 million to shareholders, including $500 million of share repurchases and $120 million in common dividends paid. As of December 31, $1.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remains for 2022. From January 1 through February 2, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million common shares for $180 million. Cash and investments at the holding company were $1.9 billion at year-end. As a reminder, included in the holding company cash at the end of the year are the proceeds from the September debt issuance, which we intend to use to redeem $600 million of hybrid securities in April 2022. During the fourth quarter, we received approximately $440 million in dividends from subsidiaries and expect between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion in 2022. Looking forward to 2022, our views for the financial outlook are largely unchanged from those we shared at Investor Day. We expect to generate profitable growth in both P&C and group benefits, subject to some uncertainty with the level of excess mortality. This coupled with our capital management plans provides a path to 13% to 14% ROE for 2022 and into 2023. We look forward to updating you on our progress. I'll now turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thank you, Beth, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was an impressive year for the Hartford's Property and Casualty business. We achieved substantial progress on each of the five critical strategy drivers as outlined during our Investor Day, and the financial results were simply outstanding. Across the five, our expanded product breadth is driving top line growth across each of our commercial businesses. Advancements in technology and data are fueling straight through processing in Small Commercial, speed to market improvements and middle and large commercial and the launch of our new personal lines' product Prevail. Our distribution footprint is stronger than ever with expanded capabilities to meet changing customer needs across multiple channels. The Hartford strong focus on customer experience is distinguishing our marketplace execution. Our Small Commercial digital experience was rated number one in the industry by Keynova and Net Promoter Scores have significantly improved in middle and large commercial, putting us in the top tier of national carriers. Finally, talent powers our engine and continues to be a differentiator. The combination of these critical drivers has delivered full year 2021 Property and Casualty written premium growth of 9% and underlying combined ratio of 89.4 and core earnings of $2 billion. The underlying combined ratio was three points lower than 2020 and core earnings were 17% higher. Our momentum in the marketplace is evident with several consecutive quarters of strong top line growth and underlying margin improvement. Let me dive a bit deeper into each of our business line results before closing with several comments about 2022. The commercial lines underlying combined ratio was 89.1 for the year, 6.4 points lower than prior year, improving 3.6 points ex COVID. The margin improvement throughout the year was driven primarily by strong earned  pricing, outstanding underwriting execution and the impact of our Hartford Next expense program. Commercial line top line performance was also exceptional, growing 12% year-over-year and 14% in the fourth quarter. Small Commercial closed a year of record performance and continued market leadership with written premium eclipsing $4 billion, an increase of 11%. Fourth quarter written premium growth was even stronger at 17%. Policy count retention increased 2% -- 2 points in the quarter, driven by consistent pricing and underwriting and enforced policies grew 6.5% versus prior year. The continuing benefit from an improving economy, including rising payrolls contributed to both the year's and the quarter's top line result. Small Commercial new business of $673 million for the year was up 21%. Fourth quarter new business was $162 million with growth of 6%, an excellent result given the economic rebound during the last quarter of 2020. New written premium growth was significant across all distribution channels and our market leading BOP product spectrum continues to have strong traction. In middle large commercial, written premium increased 12% for the year and 14% in the fourth quarter. Middle market new business of $532 million increased a 11% for the year with significant contributions from our core general industries book as well as our specialized verticals. Quote and hit rates for the year both improved over 2 points from 2020, reflecting our growing momentum, deeper product suite and improving underwriting execution. We continue to balance the rate and retention trade-off, while maintaining disciplined underwriting and leveraging our risk segmentation tools to drive profitable growth. Global Specialty produced a strong year with annual written premium growth at 13% and 11% in the quarter. New business of $912 million for the year or growth of 21% was equally impressive, and policy retention remained strong throughout the year in the mid-80s. The breadth of our written premium growth continued to be led by wholesale U.S financial lines and environmental. Global REIT also had an excellent year with written premium growth of 21%. Let's move to pricing metrics and loss trends. U.S standard commercial lines renewal written pricing was in line with the prior two quarters and continues to exceed loss trend across most products. Ex workers' compensation pricing was 6.5 in the quarter, with workers' comp pricing coming in at 1.2%. Within middle market, ex comp pricing also remained sequentially consistent at 8%. In Global Specialty, U.S pricing in the quarter was still quite good at 9%. U.S wholesale achieved 12.7% and ocean marine 13.5. Fourth quarter pricing gains in the international portfolio of 11.6 remain strong. Across commercial lines, loss trends and loss ratios for the year were largely in line with expectations. For the year the ex-cat current ex year loss ratio improved 4.9 points with a fourth quarter reduction of 190 basis points, benefiting in part from lower COVID losses. Ex COVID, this loss ratio improvement of 2.1 points for the year for the year and 60 basis points for the quarter. Loss ratio improvement in the fourth quarter was driven by stronger pricing and favorable property frequency, partially offset by a few large property losses across our book. Shifting over to personal lines, the underlying combined ratio for the year increased 6.8 points to 89.9. Auto results were impacted by increasing vehicle trips and miles traveled. Liability frequency in the quarter continued to run favorable to expectations. However, physical damage frequency ran a bit worse. Auto severity remains elevated, primarily driven by rising wages and supply chain pressures on the cost of used cars and parts. In home, full year and fourth quarter frequency was better than our expectations. However, higher claims severity from elevated building material and labor costs drove the underlying loss ratio up over 3 points for the year and the fourth quarter. Written premiums declined 1% for both the year and the fourth quarter. However, I am encouraged by the improving growth profile in the second half of 2021. We see positive signs with rising conversion rates, steady retention and slightly improved industry shopping for our 50 plus cohort as included in J.D. Power's reported data. And Prevail, our new product is now available in eight states, with the rollout significantly expanding in 2022. While we remain pleased with the quality of our new business pricing is a top priority. More on that in a moment. Before I turn the call back to Susan for Q&A, I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2022. Consistent with Investor Day, we continue to project 2022 commercial lines written premium growth between 4% and 5% with an underlying combined ratio between 86.5 and 88. 5. Coming off significant 2021 growth of 12%, 4 to 5 is a strong target for this year. We expect to return to more historical patterns of workers' compensation exposure growth, counterbalanced with rising wages in 2022. The projected underlying combined ratio is approximately 2/3 loss ratio and 1/3 expense. Renewal written pricing in commercial lines excluding workers' compensation is expected to run in the mid-single-digits with certain Global Specialty lines such as wholesale and U.S ocean marine closer to double digits. Workers' compensation pricing is projected to remain competitive, especially in Small Commercial. Renewal written pricing is projected to be flat to slightly negative. Across commercial lines, we expect earned pricing will continue to exceed loss trend in most lines, except workers' compensation. In personal lines, we expect auto frequency to modestly increase, but remain below pre-pandemic trajectory. Persistent building and material inflation, increasing labor costs and supply chain disruptions throughout '22 will continue to impact severity. As a result of these trends, our auto and home regulatory filings have ramped up significantly over the last 90 days. I expect this elevated filing activity to continue throughout the first half of the year. To ensure our initial price points reflect our most current view of loss trend, we've been deliberate and thoughtful with an adjusted Prevail state launch schedule. All-in, we expect 2022 personal lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92. In closing, 2021 was an outstanding year for our property and casualty business and a strong validation of our multi-year roadmap. Our commercial lines business buoyed by the improving economy grew at a double-digit clip. Strong pricing earned into the commercial book driving lower current accident year loss ratios, each commercial business delivered strong execution and improved accident year performance, and early results from the launch of Prevail in personal lines demonstrate encouraging signs that our cloud platforms with contemporary product design features will compete well into the next decade. The seamless integration of our product portfolio, technology and analytics, distribution and talent have driven our success in the marketplace. As I expressed at our November Investor Day, I'm extremely pleased with our 2021 performance. The results are strong and sustainable as is our future. I look forward to updating you all on our 2022 performance with our first quarter call. Let me now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak : Andrew, we're ready to take questions. Operator :  The first question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, thanks a lot. So, just taking a deeper look at the personal lines area, it looks like you came in at an auto combined ratio of 105.4. And you're in the midst of rolling out the Prevail program. So, I'm wondering how long it takes to kind of get those rate increases in place. And when do you think you could get to a loss ratio in an attractive range and where that might be? Doug Elliot : So, a few different questions inside. Let me see if I can uncouple and answer them. First point I'd make is that, from a seasonal perspective, our fourth quarter loss ratio is our highest quarter in the year. And consistent with our planning and history and also performance in 2021, I just want to note that it runs 3 to 5 points on average per year higher than our number for the year. So that is inside the fourth quarter. Secondly, as I said, in my remarks, we have rolled out eight states. By the end of 2022, we expect to be in more than 40 states. So, an aggressive rollout, although we have delayed a few states based on a rework around supply chain. We are actively working 45 states right now from a filing perspective. I think you've seen our pricing progress over the last couple years, we reported in the supplement relatively steady over that period of time. So, our rate need 9 months ago was relatively small. That has changed as we've watched supply chain and Andrew, we're reacting to that on a weekly basis. So aggressive approach to what we're doing with filings happening by the week, by the month, aggressive in first quarter second quarter and expect over the next 5 months we will be largely through that effort. And you'll continue to see as we work our way through 2022, the results in our written pricing as demonstrated in our supplement. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks for that. I mean, it sounds like you're very confident in trajectory. As I think about personal lines in general, fitting in with the property, casualty business, do you see that as a fit -- as a core fit? And is that a business that you feel is necessary to be in over the long haul? Chris Swift : Yes, Andrew, it's Chris. I would say, yes, we see it as a fit. We like the business. Obviously, over the years, we've improved our contractual relationship with AARP and extended it for 10 years. So, I think of it is primarily an affinity direct marketing business with two great brands, meaning AARP and THE HARTFORD. So in particularly with the modernized product, the platform, our digital emphasis, I think we can really make something happen here that we hadn't been able to do before just given some of the contractual arrangements. So, it's a preferred segment we like, and I think we got a good brand in there, and it's not unusual for commercial line carriers that have personal lines operations, and we think it contributes to our overall profile and our overall earnings and hourly components. Operator : The next question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Good morning. This may be a quick follow-up on what you were just talking about. You mentioned some contract changes. I guess, I'm wondering, the last time industry had to correct pricing on auto back in 2015 to 2017, you may not have been able to be as agile. And I'm wondering how the playbook may change now because I believe now you have more 6-month policies versus 12-month policies? Or were there any other structural changes that would make you more agile this go around? Doug Elliot : I guess a few things, Tracy, I would point out. You're right. Our Prevail product is a 6-month product for auto. So that changes the dynamics of how we'll manage the product, the speed and our flexibility around that. There's also a feature of lifetime continuation in the old product that now is not with the new product going forward, essentially across the country. So, yes, we think we have a much more nimble approach, a contemporary product and excited about the early results. But we have a lot of work in front of us in '22 to get it rolled out across the country. Tracy Benguigui : Okay, great. So just to be clear, that's just in Prevail and not in AARP? Doug Elliot : That is the new product is 6 months is Prevail, correct. Tracy Benguigui : Yes. Okay. Got it. It looks like \u2026 Chris Swift : Tracy, just one \u2026 Tracy Benguigui : Yes. Chris Swift : Tracy, it's Chris. Just one point of emphasis. Doug, obviously is thinking about Prevail and then our existing in force book and all the work that we have to do, but even in our existing 12-month policy, new business only is not having a lifetime continuity agreement. So, we have the ability over the last 18 months or so -- 12 months, we're writing new business with AARP even in the non-Prevail product. We are not writing new business with lifetime continuity agreements. So, but the vast majority of the in-force still obviously has lifetime continuity. So just one just a little nuance. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you for jumping in. That's really helpful. Maybe shifting gears, I noticed the Harford loss AOCI during 2021 and it looks like that may happen given higher interest rates. But I also noticed at the same time you're shortening the duration of P&C assets from 5 years back in September 2020 to 4.3 years now at year-end. Is that something we could expect to continue? And I'm just wondering how important AOCI is in the way you manage capital? Beth Costello : Yes, Tracy, I'll take that. As a significant change some of that is also related to just the change in the duration of the liabilities. But we did shorten duration in what we refer to as our surplus assets just given our views of what's happening with interest rates. So, some of the sales that we did in the fourth quarter where on the longer end, but I would say that it's not a significant change, but again just our way of positioning the portfolio. We do look at AOCI in total. But again, I wouldn't characterize some of the changes we've made in anything all that significant. Operator : The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the capital side. Do you bought back $1.7 billion in '21? That\u2019s ahead of kind of $1.5 billion that you would point it to for '21 and then also for '22? And given the dividends that you laid out with your outlook from the subs over the coming year, I mean, it seems like you could probably finance more than $1.3 billion. So, is there some upside to the 2022 capital return plan? And how should we think about the timing of getting the shares that and perhaps exceeding that? Chris Swift : Elyse, I would start and then Beth can add her commentary. Yes, we're pleased with our capital management actions over the last years and equally what we believe we're going to continue to do going forward. But it's premature right now to start to speculate what are we going to do for the rest of the year and into '23. I think we've always been clear with you when we change our views and have additional excess capital to allocate. We'll communicate with you. But right now we want to finish our existing program. Obviously, see how the year plays out, make sure we're funding all our internal growth opportunities. And then Beth might comment upon S&P, just see where that falls out. But those are the parameters that we just think about over a longer period of time. But what would you add? Beth Costello : The only thing I would add, Elyse, I really look at the additional amount that we did in '21 is just an acceleration of what our plans were for 2022. I mean, as you know, we typically do look to execute our capital management plans ratably over the periods, but we're not agnostic to share price. And our program does provide us flexibility to react when movements in share price make it attractive for us to maybe repurchase a bit more than we had originally planned. And as Chris said, we're executing on the total authorization of $3 billion and very pleased with that. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my follow-up is on loss trend on within commercial line. So, when you set your underlying margin guide for '22, and also when you make the comment, right, would you expect pricing to continue to exceed loss trend? What do you guys see in the loss trend environment, and how -- what's embedded there within your 2022 guidance? Doug Elliot : Elyse, I would say that largely '22 loss trend picks are consistent with '21. Comp was certainly consistent vis-a-vis both frequency and severity. We've talked about medical severity up over mid-single-digits and then the higher middle digits and frequency has been pretty favorable. The one tweak we have made in the last couple of years, I guess two tweaks. One is, we're aware of and focused on supply chain to where its supply chain is heading, building construction property, et cetera. We've bumped up that trend a little bit, and we continue to watch excess trend as well. So casualty excess is an area where we've been in the high single digits and remain there for '22. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. I'm going to -- my first question is going to focus on the growth outlook for commercial lines that you reiterated in Slide 9 of your investor deck. And I guess what I'm trying to do is, we're looking at the pieces here, the strong results of '21, we're looking at Slide 10, where you show the continuing positive trend of rate. And just sitting back here from the cheap seats is looks like the 4% to 5% targeted growth for '22 looks to be low hanging fruit, especially in the context of a rate environment that continues to be favorably -- favorable as it relates to price over loss cost trends. So, I thought maybe you could give some additional color on that. Doug Elliot : Yes, so let me try, Greg. I'd start with across commercial, our three big businesses. As we've mentioned, there's been a little bit of tailwind behind this from economic growth, right, coming through exposure and premium audits primarily in the workers' comp area. So when you think about as an example, Small Commercial, which is up over 10% for 2021 in the 12% range, we share with you PIF  change in the supplement. PIF is running new policies in-force at 6.5, right? So, customer count is up. The rest of that is roughly exposure plus or minus, and it varies by line of business. But it gives you a sense that we see quite a bit of tailwind, more tailwind in '21 from exposure than we had seen prior certainly relative to '20 when the market went the other way and even historically. Same thing in middle that when we look at our business up small teens, there's a fair amount of that coming from what I would say elevated exposure growth, bouncing back over 2020. So, when you hold some of that abnormal growth out, you get more a mid-single-digit type run rate. And we think that's still a strong run rate now. Yes, we expect pricing to be strong. And yes, I'd like to see our PIF growth continue to grow. But I have to suggest to you that when we look at these growth rates, a good percentage 50% to 60% of some of those growth numbers driven by exposure change that we expect will slow down quite a bit in 2022. That help a little? Gregory Peters :  Yes, it does. It's -- yes, I -- that makes sense. Just trying to parse out what is due to economic rebound versus the rest of the ordinary business, a little hard for us sitting on the outside to figure out, if that makes sense to you. Doug Elliot : The other last point I would share, Greg is you also have to do a compare, right. So, the compare against '20 for our '21 performance was a easier compare because of what happened in the second quarter of 2020. We had a terrific year, this year. Essentially, we wrote through in terms of new business as much as we had expected 9 months ago for an 18.4-month period. So now all of a sudden, the '22 compare will become more challenging just because of the success we had in '21. Gregory Peters : Yes. That makes sense. Chris Swift : Greg, make no mistake. I mean, we are focused on growth, right? We think it's a great time to grow given the environment. But you also know that a lot of our competitors, since it's a good time to grow, too. So, there is still a discipline that we still want the teams to have. We want them to be orientated to growth and taking risk and using all the sophisticated tools we have on our underwriting side, but it's not growth at all costs. Gregory Peters : That makes sense. The other question I had, Slide 18, this is -- this isn't necessarily particular to you, it's an industry phenomenon. But the returns from LPs in '21 have been outstanding, and it doesn't seem like that's a sustainable result. And I guess what I'm getting at is, what's the normalized long-term expected return on your LPs? And is that sort of the number we should be using as we think about the contribution from that in '22 and beyond? Chris Swift : Greg, I'm going to ask Beth to add her color. But you're right. I mean, we've enjoyed two years of superior returns, however, you want to look at it, either from a mark to market side or a cash realization side, some of our real estate investments have been just homeruns across the board in addition to our private equity capability. So, you're right. That can't continue at the same rate and, Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes, what I would add is, as we think about the asset class and over the long-term, we think about our return more in sort of the 8% to 10% range, it's how we think about what this asset class can deliver to us. Obviously, very pleased with the results we had this year. And as Chris indicated, a significant portion of the gains that we had were actual realizations of asset sales and so forth in the underlying fund. So, all in all, great performance, but I'd think about kind of 8% to 10%. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Hey, great. Good morning. Maybe first question on Global Specialty. Any color on what's driving the reserve developments, especially now given that the ADC cover from Navigators, I believe is exhausted? Chris Swift : Yes, Mike, I would share with you just the context on the ADC, why we put it into place. First, it was really the strategic opportunity to acquire the old Navigators and add to our capabilities. I think we've picked up a wonderful team, culturally aligned with us, and really doing great things in the marketplace. Our Global Specialty book today, you could see a supplement is $2.6 billion, and is running strong overall profitability that we've worked hard to improve, particularly Doug in the Global Specialty leadership team have really put our fingerprint on that business. But back to the ADC, we put it in place, because we knew they had some issues on their balance sheet. And the way we thought about financing with cash and using at ADC, I think was the right decision. Obviously, we needed it. And we are where we are today. But I would say going forward it's completely different. It's given our fingerprints are all over it. When I look at their reserve positions and balance sheets right now, I'm really pleased where the Global Specialty balance sheet is in total for the future. So that's what I would say. Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes, I agree on the comments on the overall balance sheet. And as it relates to the specific activity that we saw this quarter, it was primarily in financial lines and a little bit in life sciences and really just a reaction to some higher-than-expected large loss emergence. So, as we looked at what we were experiencing and went to make our year-end picks took all that into consideration. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great. Yes. And I didn't -- overall reserve development was very healthy. I didn't mean to pick on it. I just know it's been recurring, so I felt like it was worth asking. Follow-up, just want to be clear on personal lines. Your results take many others in auto have deteriorated. And so just as we think about the outlook and you gave us a number of initiatives, you're taking to that should improve the loss ratio in auto. In terms of cadence, should we be thinking it's more kind of second half of the year loaded in terms of the improvement? Doug Elliot : So as our written pricing goes in, obviously, we'll be earning that heavier element second half of the year. Our loss trend picks, though, are spread throughout the year as we deem appropriate. And as I mentioned, although we think frequency will be just up slightly, we have leaned into supply chain on the severity side. So that is a part of our overall assumption. And I think on top of the trends we experienced this year, which are -- we all can see, as you look at loss ratio performance '20 versus '21, I think that the combination of both these years and our expectations for increased severity next year are reasonable selections that we made inside our business plan. Beth Costello : Yes, the one thing that I'll just add to that as it relates to trend, and I know, Doug commented on this before, is just keep in mind that fourth quarter is always a high auto quarter for us from a seasonality perspective. And I think to the point as we look to get right into the book as we think about increases in supply chain, I think when you look at the first half of the year in 2022 compared to the first half of the year in 2021, I'd expect to see things a little bit elevated from there, because we really started to feel supply chain in the latter part of '22, just from a compare perspective, if that's helpful. Doug Elliot : Mike, maybe one other thought, too. I don't think it's well-known, but when you look at loss costs inside personal lines auto, a significant component of that auto loss cost piece is liability. So, supply chain is impacting, its damn differently than liability and not to be underestimated, liability has been performing for us. So, knock on wood. We still have to watch and we have to perform through 2022. But more that supply chain is sitting on top of physical damage, and physical damage is not 100% of the loss costs. Mike Zaremski : It's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Gary Ransom : Good morning. Yes, I wanted to ask in commercial lines, whether there were any segments or lines where you were doing any meaningful true ups at the end of the year? And I -- in the back of my mind is just the casualty trends and the distortions that we've had, whether -- how you might have incorporated that into your final loss picks for '21. Doug Elliot : Gary, when I think about accident year '21 to start, I would say that very quiet activity. I mean, Gary, we had leaned into our loss trend selections in planning out the 2021 year. And as you know, on those casualty lines, unless there's some raising real big reason, we don't come off those trend lines for multiple years. And then as we always do every time we close the book, so looking back on all the prior accident years, we had some pluses and minuses, the net of all that was a generally a pretty favorable quarter, relative to that and we've talked about Navigator. So, I feel really solid about our balance sheet. I think we work hard at it. We assess it. And '21 performed basically in line with expectations with the exception of some of the pressures we saw from COVID and supply chain. Gary Ransom : Is there anything that I should read into the Small Commercial year-over-year comparison that was -- underlying was up a little bit? Doug Elliot : Love that question. What I want you to read into Small Commercial is 88 and 17% growth in fourth quarter and over 11% in the year, right? So that business is hitting on all cylinders. We feel really good about our rate adequacies. We are strong across, Gary, all the lines inside Small Commercial. And I think the rollout of our new spectrum product over the last 2 years it just hit the street the exact spot we intended to. So, no, I'm very bullish. At some point you have such strong profitability. We leaned hard into growth that we felt like it was the right time to do that, it was the right product mix. And I look back on '21 and not sure I would change anything in a Small Commercial performance. Gary Ransom : Fair enough. And if I could sneak one more in. When I look at all the favorable development, we had a lot from workers' comp and cat, and I think I understand that but the other one is package where you've had a very consistent pattern of favorable development. Is there any particular story behind that or line within that package that's driving that? Beth Costello : No, I wouldn't point anything specific, Gary. I mean, again, as we evaluate the actual experience in both  frequency and severity perspective, we've made some adjustments on that. I\u2019ve been really pleased with how the line has performed over time, but nothing specific that I would point to. Gary Ransom : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you. One more question on the ADC. I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel back in when that was created that the  is about $300 million of protection, it seem like a lot. And I remember having discussion with you that the difference between buying $200 million of protection and $300 million wasn't materially a significant amount of money. So, it made sense and here we are, we've blown through it. Given that you had the ADC, it gave me some comfort in your financials about taking those charges. Has that book seasoned to a degree that you're confident that the PIF rate now are probably very close to where they will ultimately lie? Or could there be some conservatism in your picks? Because you did have sort of the protection of the ADC to ring fence your core earnings? Chris Swift : Yes, it's -- you got a lot of different veins of thinking in there, Josh. What I would say is, as I tried to say, we feel good about where the balance sheet is now. We put our fingerprints over it for the last 2.5 years, including new business. So, we got it positioned the way we want it. And that's what I would say. Josh Shanker : And, I mean, look, it can go both ways. I'm just curious if, I guess we'll leave it there. I don't think I'm going to get more out on this issue. So, I'll leave it at that. On the personal lines, you look -- you've been rewriting your business for a long time rewriting it. Is there any argument that your customers at this point are stickier than the average customers in the industry? They've been with you through a lot of rounds of rate changes and underwriting revisions. And you should have a higher persistency even in the face of higher prices compared to some peers? Doug Elliot : I think we have a strong customer base that believes in our product and our association with AARP. So, in general, retentions I expect to be strong. To me, one of the hallmarks of great retention is consistency and pricing and a super product. And I believe those are all priorities, they are in terms of our strategy and behaviors as we work through time. And I'm excited about the advancement of the contemporary product design that we're going to see with Prevail. So, we felt we needed to do that. It's been a big investment, a lot of work. But we felt like this was the right time for us to completely refresh and rebuild our product so that, Josh, that degree of stickiness was not only stay the same, but get stronger. I think it will over time. Josh Shanker : Thank you. Operator : And unless there's time for any other questions, I see it is past the top of the hour. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us today. If we did not get to take your question, please reach out to my office and we will be happy to follow-up. Have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

Chris Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Last April at our first quarter earnings call, I had said, I've never been more excited about the future of The Hartford and was extremely bullish about our prospects for growth and further margin expansion. Since then, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver on these commitments through exceptional execution quarter after quarter. We continued that momentum in the first quarter with core earnings of $561 million or $1.66 per diluted share, up from $203 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was $51.42, and our 12-month core earnings ROE was 14.8%. During the quarter, we were pleased to return $530 million to shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends. These results and actions demonstrate our commitment to long-term value creation through consistent profitable growth, continued investment in our business and return of capital to shareholders. We delivered these results during a very dynamic period, which is likely to continue with ongoing challenges from COVID, the secondary impacts of the Ukraine conflict and the anticipated Fed actions to raise interest rates, while shrinking its balance sheet to address historically high levels of inflation. And yet, there are reasons for optimism. Unemployment remains very low, 3.6% at the end of March. US consumers are historically holding low levels of debt with healthy savings. Home prices have appreciated 17% on average over the past year, providing a valuable source of equity for homeowners. Corporations have strong balance sheets and healthy earnings profiles, while new US business applications are up 65% from the pre-pandemic levels, a trend that is expected to continue. We view the economic environment as favorable to our business where growth is fueled by higher employment levels, rising wages, new business start-ups and commercial exposure expansion. I remain confident that The Hartford is well positioned to perform across its portfolio of businesses to deliver on our goals, maximizing value for our stakeholders. Now let's turn to the highlights from the quarter, which illustrate how our strategy translates into consistent and sustainable financial performance. Overall, Commercial Lines results outperform with double-digit top line growth and expanding margins in all businesses. In Small Commercial, we hold a clear leadership position with our innovative products, digital platform and data analytics, setting us apart from the competition. Last year, we delivered a record growth, eclipsing $4 billion in annual premium. And in the first quarter, we continued this positive momentum with very strong new business and increased premium retention. Middle and large commercial results are benefiting from sustained investments in underwriting capabilities, broader product offerings as well as innovative digital and data science tools. In Global Specialty, we continue to maximize our expertise to gain market share while expanding margins with overall profitability improvement, up more than 10 points from the second half of 2019. As it relates to the Ukraine conflict, first, let me say, we share the world's outreach at the tragic and senseless death, suffering and destruction and pray for an end to this needless violence. From The Hartford's perspective, we have very modest direct exposure within the region, which is meaningfully reinsured. We have a definite amount of premium there and have actively controlled our exposure in the run-up to the conflict and subsequent to the start of the hostilities. Beth will cover the financial impacts to the quarter. In Personal Lines, results were in line with expectations and reflect our transformative work and unique AARP relationship. I am pleased with the progress we are making as we roll out Prevail, our innovative and cloud-based platform that provides a simplified digital customer experience and uses data science to drive new business growth in a profitable 50-plus age segment. Turning to Group Benefits. As expected, we continue to be impacted by the pandemic. However, our underlying performance was solid and continues to demonstrate our market leadership position. Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% in the quarter and reflects both increased premium from existing customer and a full point improvement in persistency over the prior year. Favorable employment trends and rising wages also contributed to premium growth. Sales for the current quarter are down year-over-year as the first quarter of 2021 benefited from the expansion of paid family medical lead products in several states. Adjusting for that one-time lift, sales are comparable to prior year across our life, disability and supplemental health products. Through the first three months of the year, our long-term disability book is performing as expected, with modestly higher  the higher incident rate is reflected in our future pricing and was anticipated when we set forth our margin expectations for 2022. Modestly higher expenses in the quarter reflect higher staffing costs to manage elevated short-term disability claims and accelerated investments in capabilities, including digital  administrative platforms. We expect the full year 2022 expense ratio to be generally consistent with first quarter results. During the quarter, the number of U.S. COVID cases were at their highest levels of the pandemic and thus were elevated. However, both cases and deaths have rapidly declined in March and April. Clearly, the past two years have shown that predicting that pandemic impacts is impossible. But with cases and test at their current levels, we are cautiously optimistic about the remaining quarters of 2022. And -- in conclusion, the Hartford is off to a strong start in 2022. We are optimistic about macro factors impacting our business, including improving pandemic outcomes and the potential for easing of inflationary pressures. We continue to manage our investment portfolio prudently and expect the portfolio yield to benefit from rising interest rate environment over time. And we are continuing to proactively manage our capital. All these factors underpin my confidence that we will generate a 13% to 14% core earnings ROE in 2022 and 2023. Our strategy and the investments we've made in our business have established the Hartford as a proven performer with consistent results. We are competitively positioned with a complementary and a well-performing portfolio of businesses and a winning formula to consistently achieve superior risk-adjusted returns. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of $561 million or $1.66 per diluted share reflects excellent P&C underwriting results, a significant contribution from the investment portfolio, and reduced pandemic-related impacts and group benefits. As Chris commented, this is written related to Russia-Ukraine exposure had a modest impact on results. We recorded $27 million of net catastrophe losses, primarily related to political violence and terrorism, including aviation war and credit and political risk insurance.  As a result of incurred losses covered by our reinsurance treaties, we recorded a provision for ceded reinstatement premium of $11 million. The company's direct investment exposure is limited to corporate bonds issued by Russian entities with an amortized cost of $16 million, and we recorded an allowance for credit losses of $9 million in the quarter. We do not have any investments in Belarus or Ukraine. Moving on to the business line results. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $456 million, up $351 million from the prior first quarter, primarily driven by the reserve increase in the 2021 period for boy scouts and a stronger top line and lower catastrophes in the current period. Commercial Lines reported 12% written premium growth, reflecting an increase in new business in small commercial, strong policy retention, written pricing increases and exposure growth. The underlying combined ratio of 88.3% improved 2.9 points from the first quarter of 2021, due to COVID losses in the prior year and a lower expense ratio and slightly improved margins across several product lines in 2022. In Personal Lines, core earnings were $84 million, and the underlying combined ratio of 88.5%, reflects increased auto loss cost as anticipated. I would note that, from a seasonality perspective, the first quarter typically has lower loss costs in the balance of the year. As Doug will comment upon, we are making progress in getting more rate into the book given the impact of inflation on loss costs. Although, our yield inflation impact is a bit higher than where we were a quarter ago, we expect to be within the underlying combined ratio guidance of 90% to 92% for the full year, albeit at the high end. P&C current accident year catastrophes in the first quarter were $98 million before tax, which included the $27 million related to Russia, Ukraine exposures that I just mentioned. P&C prior accident year reserve development was a net favorable $36 million, with workers' compensation being the largest contributor. Turning to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $8 million compares to a core loss of $3 million in first quarter 2021. Core earnings reflect a lower level of excess mortality losses in group life, partially offset by a higher disability loss ratio and an increase in the expense ratio. All cost excess mortality in the quarter was $96 million before tax compared to $185 million in the prior year quarter. The $96 million included a 122 million with days of loss in the first quarter which was partially offset by favorable deployment on prior quarters. The disability loss ratio increased 4.8 points over the prior year period, primarily due to less favorable prior and current year development in long term disability, as a 2021 loss ratio benefited from low instance level from earlier in the pandemic. The long-term disability loss ratio in the quarter was in line with our expectations, which included an assumption for increased incidents relatively to the past couple of years. Long term disability claim recoveries remain strong and are consistent with prior year. Lastly, the expense ratio for group benefit increased 0.6 points. Consistent with expectations, the expense ratio was impacted by higher staffing costs to handle elevated short-term disability claims and increase investors and technology partially offset by incremental Hartford next expense savings and the effective earned premium growth. The four excess mortality in COVID short term disability loss, the Group benefits core earnings margin was 5.7%. From a seasonality perspective, we experienced higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter, so we would expect the margin to be lower than our full year estimate. We remain confident in our guidance of a 6% to 7% core earnings margins for full year 2022, excluding COVID impact. Turning to Hartford Funds, due to equity market declines in higher interest rates, AUM decreased during the quarter to $148 billion, resulting in a sequential quarterly decrease in core earnings, though core earnings were up 11% compared to first quarter of 2021. Our investment portfolio delivered another strong quarter, net investment income was $509 million benefiting from very strong annualized limited partnership returns of 14.6% driven by relatively balanced contributions from our private equity and real estate equity investments. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 2.9% before tax. With the increase in interest rates and wider credit spreads, the portfolio's reinvestment rate was 3.3%, which compares favorably to the average sales maturity yield of 3%. Not surprisingly, the portfolio value was also impacted by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. The portfolio moved from an unrealized gain position of $2.1 billion at year end to an unrealized loss of approximately $300 million. Additionally, the portfolio had a net realized loss of $145 million, which includes $107 million of mark to mark losses on the public equity portfolio, reflecting the decline in equity markets in the quarter. While it is still early, as we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the limited partnership annualized return will be in the 8% to 10% range. Both private equity and real estate equity investments contribute to our LP return, and this diversification has proven to be beneficial. So while interest rates and capital markets may remain volatile, we are confident that our high-quality and well diversified portfolio will continue to support our financial goals and objectives. The confidence we have in our business is also evidenced by our capital management actions. As of March 31, approximately $900 million of share repurchase authorization remains for 2022. From April 1 through April 27, we repurchase approximately 1.9 million common shares for $139 million. On April 15, we redeem 600 million of hybrid securities with a rate of 7.875%. We have pre-funded this redemption with the issuance of $600 million of 2.9% senior notes last September, which will result in net annual after-tax savings of approximately $24 million. In summary, our first quarter financial performance demonstrates the positive results that building and investing in our businesses have yielded. Combined with prudent capital management, we are positioned to deliver on our goals. I will now turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thanks, Beth, and good morning everyone. The Hartford's Property & Casualty strong first quarter results are evidence of the substantial progress achieved to expand product breadth, advanced technology and data science, deepen our distribution footprint and differentiate the customer experience. These accomplishments are powered by our skilled talent base positioning us well for profitable growth. Starting with Commercial Lines, I'm pleased with the underwriting performance across product lines and the improving expense leverage. Written premium growth was strong in the quarter sustaining the top line momentum achieved last year. With the acceleration of growth during 2021, the year-over-year compares will get more challenging in subsequent quarters, but we're confident there's upside to our initial target of 4% to 5%. Starting with pricing, in January, we shared with you our 2022 Commercial Lines guidance was contemplated moderated renewal pricing, and first quarter was largely in line with those expectations. Commercial written pricing, excluding workers compensation was 7.1% moderating about a point from the fourth quarter, but continuing to exceed loss cost trends across most products. This moderation was largely experienced in middle market and global specially. Workers Compensation pricing declined slightly from the fourth quarter as expected. The dynamics of higher average wages partially offset by negative filed rates will likely persist throughout 2022. New written premium and Small Commercial was up 6% driven by Spectrum and retention improved two points from last year. Our number one rated digital customer experience, outstanding product capabilities and rising no touch bindability levels are driving business to the Hartford as customers continue to embrace our consistent pricing and underwriting approach, leading to higher sales an excellent retention. Middle market pricing excluding workers compensation was 6.5%, a very solid start to the year. Retention was up four points from the first quarter of 2021, while new business premium was essentially flat. Robust exposure growth also contributed to our quarterly top line increase of 10%.  Pricing remains strong in global specialty at 8.3% with U.S. wholesale pricing just over 9%. Premium retention was steady and growth from our reinsurance business was significant. We continue to be pleased with our growing momentum, deeper product suite and improved underwriting execution. Turning to loss costs. Our 2022 guidance also reflected our disciplined and long-term consistent approach to loss trend selection, including the expected impact of supply chain inflationary pressures in our auto and property books, along with social and economic headwinds in other lines, overall loss trends and loss ratios for the quarter were inline with a few puts and takes. In summary for Commercial. I'm very pleased with the continued excellent performance of each of our businesses, and I expect to achieve our underlying full year guidance of 86.5 to 88.5. Small Commercial delivered yet another sub-90 underlying combined ratio quarter at our best first quarter since 2014. At 91.5, Middle and Large Commercial has now achieved four straight quarters of strong underlying performance, and this quarter's result is the best first quarter in over a decade. And Global Specialties underwriting combined ratio -- underlying combined ratio of 88.2 is equally impressive, reflecting the recent strong pricing environment, improved underwriting execution and significant underwriting actions taken since the acquisition. As these results demonstrate, we are effectively balancing the rate and retention trade-off, while maintaining disciplined underwriting and leveraging risk segmentation tools to continue driving profitable growth. Flipping over to Personal Lines we're very pleased with the first quarter underlying combined ratios of 88.5, acknowledging the typical first quarter seasonality benefit and industry loss cost headwinds. Maintaining profitability of the legacy book has been a primary focus, while developing our new product, Prevail. Consequently, over the past several years, we continued to selectively tune pricing. In Personal Lines Auto, loss costs were elevated, primarily due to higher-than-expected severity, particularly in physical damage. We have not been immune to supply chain and inflation pressures. And in response, over the past several months we have completed over 50 auto filings with an average rate increase of 6.2%. These filings were across multiple class plans and will impact approximately half of our book going forward. In addition, we continue to recalibrate Prevail pricing to reflect these elevated loss trends. We're confident our filing execution, combined with prudent rate increases taken during the past few years, we'll continue to position our auto book for profitable growth. In Home, overall loss costs were in line with quarter one of 2021. Non-cat weather frequency continues to run favorable to long-term averages while material and labor costs remain at historically high levels, putting pressure on severity. We're similarly taking pricing actions in home. All in, our current accident year home loss ratio of 47.3% is very healthy. Turning to Personal Lines production. Retention remained steady while we generated new business growth in the quarter. Responses and conversion rates are in line with expectations. In addition, Prevail is now available in 13 states, including the launch of Florida in January and Texas in April, a couple of our larger states. We're actively managing our new business flow through an accelerated view of key metrics and enhanced analytics, to-date we're pleased with the quality of the new business we're writing. In closing, the first quarter was a very strong start to 2022 across property casualty and represents mounting evidence that we have and will continue to deliver on our critical strategic goals. Our Commercial Lines business grew at a double-digit clip with exceptional operating margins. And in personal lines, pricing actions are taking hold, while new business growth is emerging with increasing contributions from Prevail. The seamless integration of our product portfolio, technology and analytics, distribution and talent continue to drive our success in the marketplace. The momentum is clear. The results are strong and our future is bright. I look forward to our next update in 90 days. Let me now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thank you. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question today comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thank you. A couple of questions here. First, Beth, I'm just curious, could you give us what the current new money yield that you're actually getting or new money rate that you're getting right now in your portfolio? And how does that compare to what your book yield is? And then how much of your portfolio kind of turns every 12 months? And then on that also, Chris, why 13 \u2013 why consistent ROE 22% to 23% given the rise in interest rates? Beth Costello : Sure, Brian, I'll start. So yeah, as we look today, the new money rate is probably closer to 3.8% compared to the 3.3% average that we had for the quarter. Obviously compares very favorable to the Folio yield so you may recall a quarter ago when we were talking about our expectations for yield for 2022, I had said that, we expected to see a slight decline from where we were in 2021. Given where we are today, we'd expect 2020 to be relatively consistent with 2021 and then see increases as we go into 2023. Chris Swift : Yeah. And Brian, on the range question, 13% to 14% is obviously what we've been talking about for the last year, as you heard my confidence and optimism today. I believe we will achieve that in both those years. And you should not view the 14% as a limit, and we will try to achieve it. If the conditions are appropriate, particularly as Beth said, we'll have to see how the portfolio lift really plays out over a longer period of time. But that could be meaningful, particularly as you get into 2023. Brian Meredith : Got you. And then my second question is, I guess, more Doug and Chris, Russia-Ukraine, what was your gross loss? It seems like you had a fairly \u2013 the reinstatement premium, obviously, you had some reinsurance recoveries. And then also on that topic, Russia-Ukraine, maybe a little more kind of details as far as where your exposures are? And where could there potentially be some more losses coming from Russia-Ukraine? Chris Swift : Sure. So I would -- Doug will add his commentary. I would say that most of the exposures that we have, obviously, have come through our syndicate in London, primarily through the political violence and credit and political risk book. We have about $45 million of net written premium in those lines. And as we said in our prepared remarks, it is heavily reinsured. So clearly, the war is still evolving. And the loss picks that we made, I think are very prudent and thoughtful about the \u2013 I will call it exposure that we have I will give you a little insight. We've only had two notices of loss and one we denied. So the entirety is nearly just all IBNR at this point in time. So I think that's all I'd share with you right now, given it's a live event. But we used a lot of data in Intel, including satellite imagery to look at properties that were exposed and feel really good about the picks that we made at this point. Doug, would you add anything else? Doug Elliot : No, I think you nailed it, Chris. We \u2013 Brian, have a very good handle on the risks located in those countries. I think we understand our book well. And this process has been deliberate and prudent. And I think Beth and I feel really good about the call we made in the quarter for what we know. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I noticed in your prepared remarks, you gave us a sense of where you might fall within that personal lines underlying margin guide. So what about within commercial, right, 86.5% to 88.5%, I know, we're only one quarter in. But given how things have come together in the quarter as well as your view on pricing and loss trends for the balance of the year, do you have a sense of where you might fall within that range within commercial lines? Chris Swift : Elyse, we haven't changed our view. So as I said, we expect to be by that range, but there's no nuance there. I don't think our view is any different than it was 90 days ago. So we clearly have our sights set and believe we'll achieve inside that range. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question is on the group business. I'm just looking to get some more color on how you think disability trends, especially within your long-term disability book could be impacted as we potentially enter into recession and how that's kind of embedded within the guide for this year given perhaps thoughts beyond this year into 2023? A \u2013 Chris Swift : Yeah. I'm happy to try to give you color, Elyse. Yeah. I would share with you, first off, our base case of economic activities is not a recession in 2022 -- 2023. Obviously, there's still a lot of question marks, but we think the Fed will try to prudently balance growth and inflation and come to hopefully a good spot. As it relates to, I'll call it, disability trends. What I would share with you is last year at this time, we just had more favorable development particularly from the initial COVID year of 2020 than we are having this year. Also, I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about seasonality. So long-term disability claims are seasonally higher in normal conditions in the first quarter. Now living through two years of pandemic is anything but normal, but those are still the underlying trends that we see. As we sit here today, we still -- we feel very confident of achieving our 6% to 7% margin during the year. And as I said, we are both in our life book and disability book putting additional price into our pricing models that we're going to try to achieve, obviously, as we go forward. So price, particularly in the life side is probably going up 2% to 3%, and then roughly 1% to 2% for disability. So our incident trends, I would say, as we sit here today, have stabilized. There was a little concern that we had in the fourth quarter heading into this quarter that they might be rising faster than we expected, but that is not the case. So I think that's the color I can try to give you right now Elyse. Q \u2013 Elyse Greenspan : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Greg, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Greg Peters : Great. Good morning, everyone. So the first question I wanted to ask was around employee retention and recruiting. One of the other publicly traded brokers had mentioned on their call that they were seeing elevated turnover of underwriters at the carrier level. And I'm just curious about what the Hartford is seeing and what their perspective is around recruiting and retention in very difficult employment markets? A \u2013 Chris Swift : Yeah. I'll start and then I'll ask Doug to add his color, Greg. So thank you for joining us today. Yeah. Talent retention is obviously a key to most of any businesses, right? I mean, you got to put a high-quality team on the field every day and compete, which I think we've done extremely well over an extended period of time. That said, we haven't been immune to, I'll call it, elevated people movement, particularly in an environment where a lot of organizations were allowing employees to work from home or just work from just about anywhere. So I would say for calendar year 2021, our, I'll call it, turnover rates were probably elevated in the three to four to five point range depending on business unit or function. I would say, though, that they've stabilized here in the first quarter. We -- I thought it took an appropriate thoughtful point of view on bonuses and salary increases. So -- we're working hard at it. And the best way that we can combat people leaving us is to make sure our leaders and middle managers are really tuned into their people. Their needs, their desires, their career goals and objectives, giving them clear feedback and having that sense of belonging that we're invested in their career. And I think that's part of our cultural advantage that we have. But Doug, what would you say on the specifics of underwriters that are distributed throughout the country? Doug Elliot : The area is a top three item for us across our leadership ranks. We're talking about it. We're working on it. And the other thing I would share, Chris, is we've had some very significant hires ourselves in the past 90 days. So I feel really good about some of the talent that has joined The Hartford. I like where we are. We've worked hard at it, and I think it will continue to be an asset for us as we compete forward. Q \u2013 Greg Peters : Got it. And the second question, I wanted to pivot, Doug, I think in your comments, you talked about how in the Commercial Lines area, your reserving has contemplated the loss cost trends, the social inflation, the supply chain issues, et cetera. And there's rhetoric in the marketplace right now. I'm not sure if it's going to come in the pass, but there could be further disruptions in supply chain as we move through the balance of the year. And I'm just curious from your perspective, how you look at data as you see that? And do you make changes now, or do you wait until it materializes? Just some granularity with respect to your approach on that. A \u2013 Chris Swift : Greg. Let me just start, and then I'll ask Doug. So as I tried to say in my commentary, we're optimistic that some of the supply chain shock due to demand, the demand side of the equation is starting to ease, particularly as we head into the second half of the year. Now the other shock, obviously, on the supply chain from manufacturing and the war in Ukraine and China's locked down are new factors that will continue to impact just our overall view of cost of goods sold through our supply chain. So those are the dynamics. But at least from what we could see right now, there's a level of optimism that a lot of this is going to work through the system, maybe not as quick as we initially expected. But I think beginning in the fourth quarter heading in 2023, we could be in a different position, Doug? Doug Elliot : The only other item I would add is that I did comment that we had adjusted primarily in auto physical damage or supply chain loss trends around severity. So our expectation in December and our reality in March were slightly different. We made those adjustments. Lastly, I'd point out, we make very specific quarterly calls in both our planning and our reserving. So know this is a quarterly March every 90 days, as we close our books, we make sure that everything we can see in our results and anticipate and the risks around this, we built into those calls. But the machine is finally tuned to have a 90-day period-by-period March. And so yes, as we -- if we feel more pressure in the back half of the year, we will deal with it. But right now, we're hoping for some easing, as we move July through December. Q \u2013 Greg Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thanks, Greg. The next question today comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David, please go ahead. Your line is now open. David Motemaden : Hi. Good morning. It's sort of a related question for Doug. Just a question on the loss cost trends. Doug, you had mentioned some puts and some takes, but net-net came in, in line with your expectations. Wondering if you could just elaborate a bit more on what you're seeing by line? Doug Elliot : Well, I'd start with just my last comments, which is one of those puts was a little bit more pressure and water filled in. So we adjusted for supply chain. Generally, our frequency is holding. So I feel good about our frequency calls and what we're seeing with experience. And we're watching medical carefully. But so far, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing in the medical front. So all in, as we go through, and you know we've got probably close to 40 lines that we're looking on a quarterly basis. I'd say largely, our calls are holding and other than a few adjustments. First quarter came in as expected. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. And then switching gears to the Benefits business. Chris, I hear your comments, your expense ratio coming in around $26 million for the year. I guess, I'm wondering within that, it sounds like you're having higher staffing for the short-term disability claims. Is there a rule of thumb that you can give us \u2013 for example, for every $10 million of short-term disability claims, it's an extra $1 million or $2 million in extra claims handling expenses. And I guess, how should we think about that as we enter into a more endemic state of \u2013 with COVID? Chris Swift : Yeah. I don't have a metric that I can give you today. I think the surge that we really felt beginning in late third quarter into the fourth quarter and then early 2000s which is sort of unprecedented as far as volume. We did build some new digital claim intake tools that helped relieve some of the call center pressure, but still had to process thousands and thousands and thousands of claims. So just know that, we \u2013 as much as we had some elevation of expenses, our Hartford next objectives for this business are still being met. We did, as I said in my prepared remarks, take the opportunity to look at investing maybe a little faster than we thought. So that will -- that is part of what's driving that. And as I said, that's mostly in the digital area and continuing in claims. So \u2013 but all that is still contemplated, David, in achieving our 6% to 7% margin for the year. So top line is growing a little faster now than we thought after a little slow start. So when you put the overall equation together of top line loss cost trends coming down, particularly as the pandemic in the second half of the year here seems to be less severe on mortality in achieving a 6% to 7%, which translates into strong ROEs on our capital. I think that equation is somewhat \u2013 is what we like. And your expense ratio point, expense ratio will come down just a little longer. It will take just a little longer than we initially thought. David Motemaden : Got it. And appreciate the investments and capabilities, the accelerated investments that you had mentioned. So if I could just follow-up on your comments there. Could you size how much that was during the quarter? And so we could just sort of think about thing about \u2013 and I guess, maybe think about how much more on the \u2013 on those accelerated investment we should think about? Chris Swift : Okay. I tried to guide you a little bit for the full year. So just think of the full year expense ratio guide that I have you, and we\u2019ll talk about 2023 and beyond at the right time, but that's not -- we're not ready to do that right here today, David. David Motemaden : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Doug, you mentioned in personal auto, 6.2 rate; and I think you said about half year book. I\u2019m wondering, is what\u2019s needed from here in auto just taking rate in the other half, or is there more needed on top of what you're already taking in that current half of 6.2? Doug Elliot : Mike, it's an ongoing matter, right? So we're continuing to assess loss cause and assess our rate accuracy state by state. As you know, this is a rolling state program. So, as I mentioned not half of our book now has achieved file increases over the past three or four months. We've got second quarter rolling right now. So I've got expectations for second quarter, I've got expectations for third quarter. I can tell you that based on the loss cause coming in, in the last week; we probably adjusted our third quarter view in the last seven days. So it is active real time, and we will continue to manage to make sure we've got enough rate in that book based on all of the tools available to us. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick one here. You had some favorable development in small commercial loan, if you can talk about what drove that? Doug Elliot : The favorable development is primarily workers comp and it was primarily in accident year 2017 and prior -- 2018 and prior, I guess so. But our book continues to look very healthy in those accident years and our actuaries may release fair amount in the workers comp area. Michael Phillips : As you said, they are just holding steady on the\u2026 Doug Elliot : Correct. Michael Phillips : Okay. Doug Elliot : \u2026workers comp. Michael Phillips : Yeah. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Alex Scott : Thanks. First one I had is just on the P&C side. I guess in small commercial, there is, I think, favorable non-cat weather called out a little bit in home, too, it sounded like I think marine was called out global especially. I was just wondering, if you could help us quantify some of those items to help us take through the impact on the loss ratios? Chris Swift : When you roll it up, Alex, at a commercial level, the non-cat inside commercial is probably about a point. So the good weather non-cat, the other line, a little pressure on a marine loss, but the other lines are cancer points that add up to good news. So the other in general, on commercial, when we started the year, we forecasted a couple of points of underlying improvement, about half of that coming from loss and the other half coming from expense. Alex Scott : 90-day then? Chris Swift : Basically right on that. So we feel good about the start to the year I think it\u2019s right on our expectation. Alex Scott : Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe one more question I grouped for you. I guess, when you think about COVID hospital utilizations declining and as you've sort of seen that progress through the first quarter and into April. Are there lagged impacts that we should consider for disability, or should those claims come down pretty real time with what's going on in the environment for COVID? Chris Swift : Yes. I don't know, Alex, if you're referring to short-term disability, long-term -- long COVID, but I will make the assumption that you're talking about more long COVID, which is significantly lagged. And I think we've talked about it in prior settings. I mean we are seeing a modest amount of claims coming in from long COVID, that meet the definition of a long-term disability. And then, obviously, is dictating some of the pricing expectations that are changing to get more rate in the book to cover some of that. So, yes, long COVID is real, and we're trying to manage it the best we can from a claims side and then also from an economic side. Alex Scott : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, good morning. I just want to get a little more granular on some of the earlier questions. Doug, on the personal lines, you talked about half the book having achieved filing and that your real time on rates. I'm just kind of interested, particularly, in the auto line with a 2.9% rate increase in the quarter. That's about 70% of the premium that you write in personal lines. Do you need that kind of 2.9% for the next few quarter as you look out. Again, I understand its real time, but to stay in that 90% to 92% underlying, is it going to be a while before you can take your foot off the pedal? Doug Elliot : Andrew, I would suggest that our rate need is more aligned with the rate achieved in the first quarter. So we\u2019re headed toward 6% to 7%, so that\u2019s what -- 6.2% is what I shared in my script. I expect the second quarter rate to be in the 5% to 6% range and we\u2019ll talk more in 90 days about the third quarter. But -- so I step back. No, the 2.9% is not going to be adequate to cover where we are with loss costs now, which is why our filings are in excess of 5%. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. Very helpful. And then with regards to work comp, Doug, you mentioned a slight decrease in pricing. I'm going to assume that means 1% or less. And then with that, could you give a little color on the lost cost in that particular line. How much are they up? Doug Elliot : Our worker\u2019s comp is a line that\u2019s gone through a lot in the last three years with the pandemic. As we look at it today, no question that we are focused on filings as we work our way into this year and anticipate another round for 2023. There is headwind in the filing space. As you know, we essentially have negative filed rates across the marketplace that we are working to selectively underwrite our way through. Very pleased with what we\u2019ve done to-date, but I can\u2019t argue that there aren\u2019t headwinds in front of us and things will be effective as we work our way through. Are signs relative to loss trend right now, we're still sitting on our long-term trends, right? So we still look at medical in that mid-single-digit range and then to be a little bit less than that. Frequently, as I mentioned before, has been largely in check. And then I would add to you that, we\u2019re getting a little bit of benefit from wages, so we're seeing increased wages in our payroll. And as I've noted before, increased wages is a positive force as we think about our role for loss ratio. So a lot of work to be done, continued progress on the audit premium front, so positive audit. So yes, there are some puts and takes in workers' comp. I think our performance in the quarter was outstanding, and we'll manage our way to the headwinds as they come at us over the next 18 months. Andrew Kligerman : Great. Thanks for that. And if I could just sneak one quick one in on Group. 5.7% at core margin, excluding pandemic-related being a little beneath that 6 to 7, is there any non-COVID mortality that's exceeding your expectation? Are you seeing any pressures there from a mortality standpoint non-COVID? Chris Swift : Andrew, first point, 6 to 7, we will achieve that this year. So as we said in our prepared remarks and we addressed one question, there is a little bit of seasonality in our the LCD picks in the first quarter generally normalized be able to see that. So I think that's impacting the 5 7. I would also say though that we probably had on a pre-tax basis, $15 million to $20 million of elevated mortality claims in our AD&D book and waiver book that we're just random events, accidents are particularly motor vehicle accidents. There's -- unfortunately, there's a number of other actions that are occurring. So I would say those two things probably put the most pressure on that 5 7 number but we\u2019re still confident in the 6 to 7 range for the full year. Andrew Kligerman : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from Derek Han from KBW. Derek, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Derek Han : Good morning. Thanks. I had a question on the commercial premium growth. Obviously, it was strong in the quarter. The new business premiums within the middle market on the Global Specialty segment slowed a little bit. Is there anything meaningful in that? I'm just kind of curious if there was any cross-sell impact within those segments? Chris Swift : I would characterize the quarter as reasonably strong for both Global Specialty and Middle, Large Commercial. Although flat and middle and large, still a very strong quarter. And we're being thoughtful about workers' comp and our aligned product strategy. So I look at our bottom and top line performance across all of our markets and feel really good about the start to the year. Derek Han : Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question goes -- probably goes to Doug. You said that personal auto frequency is holding up pretty well. If you look at the underlying factors kind of driving that, are you seeing any increases in distracted driving? I know your customer mix is kind of unique from your peers, but just curious if you're seeing any of that impact. Doug Elliot : We have statistics and we've read statistics. So we -- our numbers concur with that, but I can't suggest to you that our book on its own would drive all those statistics. So I'm not going to sit here and say that our telematics data is robust enough to kind of jump in the way or suggest otherwise. We are watching, driving, we're watching speed, we're watching time and day, all the factors that are important to our loss costs, and I think we made appropriate provisions in the quarter. Derek Han : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. My first question is on exposure growth. I recognize you disclosed policies and ports just for your small commercial segment, but it will be good to get a more general sense of the contribution from audit premium, you did mention lead inflation or any other type of linkage to GDP type of growth. And where I'm going with this, and I just want to better understand the contribution of exposure growth to overall commercial premium. And I'm also curious if you think there's a component of exposure that acts like rate? Chris Swift : So let me tackle the first question. In our growth for mid and large and small commercial, I would suggest about half of that is coming from auto premium growth -- so very strong audit premium of our workers' compensation book in both those books of business. As you know, we have no workers' compensation in global specialty. So those are the books that are impacted by that Relative to the 7 1, Tracy, I quoted in my script, which was our pricing in the quarter, all commercial ex workers' comp, 1.5 point of that, plus or minus, coming from exposure. So the rest of that would be underlying performance, freight. Doug, anything you want to add? Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Well, I'm sure Doug was going to chime in. Okay. So my second question is, how would you describe your annual portfolio turnover rate? So just looking at your 4.4-year asset duration, do you think something like 12% makes sense? I'm just trying to get a better sense of when you'll start earning in the higher new money yields. Beth Costello : Yes, Tracy, it's probably in the 10% to 15% range. So what you're quoting is a reasonable estimate there as we look at it across the year. . Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Cool. And just staying on that, and we did touch a pro last quarter. But I noticed that you were suddenly shortening your duration of your assets, it was five years back in September 2020. it looks like this quarter, you actually extended it just slightly. So should we think about the 4.4-year duration ticking from here? Beth Costello : Yes. I mean as we talked about last quarter, we had seen the duration of the portfolio shortened. Some of that was in response to the liabilities. And also, as we looked at our surplus assets, it's our view on interest rates, we did shorten a bit anticipating a rise. Where we are today, I think, is appropriate when we kind of look at, again, our liabilities and so forth. And we're kind of consistently looking at that to determine if we need to make any changes as our liabilities move. But I wouldn't point you to any anticipation of significant changes, but it can definitely move a bit quarter-to-quarter. Tracy Benguigui : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'd like to pass the conference over to Susan Spivak for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Susan Spivak : Thank you very much for joining us today. As always, please reach out with any follow-up questions. Operator : That concludes The Hartford First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Webcast.

Core earnings for the quarter were $714 million or $2.15 per diluted share. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was $52.12, and our 12-month core earnings ROE was an outstanding 14%. During the quarter, we were pleased to return $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends. With our outlook for continued strong financial performance and capital generation the board has authorized a new share repurchase program of $3 billion effective August 1, 2022 through year end 2024. Together our strategy, superior execution and prudent Capital Management demonstrate the Hartford's commitment to long term value creation through sustained profitable growth, continued investment in our businesses in return of excess capital to shareholders. We are producing excellent results in a very dynamic macroeconomic environment as we look forward to the second half of 2022. While there are some mixed economic signals, combined with geopolitical tensions, and fed policy uncertainty, the Hartford's continues to be well positioned to manage margins and returns successfully. As we all know, within the U.S., we are experiencing historic levels of inflation, which has resulted in accelerated monetary policy tightening. These conditions appear to be pushing the U.S. economy into a lower growth environment, or possibly a mild recession. However, this is occurring against the unique backdrop of low unemployment in strong corporate and consumer balance sheets. These conditions are very different from those that existed during 2008 when the recession was driven by credit imbalances across the economy, high unemployment, and heavily leveraged balance sheets. Hartford is also a very different company today. We have well performing businesses; enhanced capabilities, a diversified portfolio of P&C and Group Benefit products, and a stronger balance sheet, including a high quality investment portfolio. All of our businesses are competing effectively in their target markets with unique value propositions, anchored by the Hartford's brand and reputation. We have invested in new capabilities to deliver an exceptional customer experience while ensuring appropriate rigor in the management of claim outcomes, including the extensive use of data science and artificial intelligence. For our two largest and strongest performing lines, workers comp and disability, these enhanced capabilities have led to improve profitability over the years and give us confidence that even during an economic slowdown, we are well positioned to minimize the impact on Lost costs. Now, I'd like to share some highlights from each of our businesses, which illustrate how our strategy translates into consistent and sustainable financial performance. Overall, Commercial lines outperform with double digit top line growth and expanding margins in the quarter. There has been much commentary about written renewal rates versus loss costs trends and the impact of inflation. We have been disciplined and prudent in establishing loss picks for 2022. Our assumptions reflect loss trends in the aggregate of approximately 5%, excluding workers compensation, reflecting our overall business mix, which skews towards small business and middle market risks. Therefore, we have approximately 100 basis points of spread between written renewal pricing and loss trends. Stepping back, I am incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in small Commercial. Over the past decade, we have built a track record of consistent superior performance with underlying combined ratios below 90 as we grew the business to over 4 billion in annual premium. Our momentum in the marketplace is evident, with several consecutive quarters of record new business. The speed and accuracy and consistency we deliver to the market along with leading digital capabilities continue to outpace competitors. We are transforming our middle and large Commercial business into a specialized organization with broad product offerings and deep underwriting skills across industry verticals, which is driving growth, strong profit margins, and more consistent results. Our execution around data science, pricing segmentation in engineering has dramatically improved, which will help drive continued underwriting discipline, a more competitive lines of business, including workers compensation. In global specialty, results are outstanding, as we continue to maximize our expertise to gain market share. Our teamwork and cross selling activities have been phenomenal and continue to strengthen the franchise. Underwriting margins have improved materially over the last three years evidenced by our 85.5% underlying combined ratio through six months in 2022. These advantages are only getting stronger, as the market recognizes our product breadth, efficiency, and ease of doing business as key differentiators. In personal lines, the rollout of the new platform prevail platform continues and is beginning to show positive traction. However, higher inflation is impacting auto results and will require additional pricing actions. Doug and Beth will talk more about that shortly. But overall, from a strategic perspective, I am pleased with the progress we are making in personal lines. Turning to Group Benefits, core earnings were $161 million, with a margin of 9.8% reflecting a rapid recovery mortality in solid disability results. Long Term Disability trends are stable in within our expectations for incident rates and recoveries. On the top line, fully insured on-going premium was up 7% but in funding from strong persistency above 90% in sales of $204 million, nearly double the prior year quarter. The excellent sales results are primarily driven by the acquisition of new cases and strong enrollment, which reflects a combination of greater product awareness among employees and new enrollment capabilities we introduced over the last 18 months. We observed that both employers and employees are highly engaged on benefit offerings in light of a pandemic. Businesses are also increasingly focused on offerings that can help them attract and retain talent in a competitive labor market and at the same time struggling with growing complexities of regulation and compliance, including emerging state paid family leave mandates. This is an opportunity for us to demonstrate higher value through our expanded products and services as we continue to grow the business. Before I turn it over to Beth, we'll leave you with some concluding thoughts. I remain confident and excited about the future of The Hartford. Our businesses are performing well and have never been stronger. We are managing the investment portfolio prudently in our holdings are well balanced across a diversified asset classes. We have proven execution capabilities, and exceptional talent that drives my confidence in our ability to continue to produce superior returns in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. And finally, we are proactively managing our excess capital to be a accretive for shareholders. All these factors underpin my confidence of achieving ROEs of 13% to 14% for this year, in 2023. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of $714 million or $2.15 per diluted share, reflects strong P&C underwriting results and premium growth and Commercial lines and group benefits as well as a reduction in pandemic impacts. In Commercial lines, core earnings were $544 million and reflect higher earned premium, improvement in the underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses in the prior year period. Commercial lines reported 14% written premium growth, reflecting written pricing increases and exposure growth, along with an increase in new business and policy cat retention and small Commercial. The underlying combined ratio of 88.1 improved 1.3 points from the prior second quarter due to a lower loss ratio primarily in global specialty lines and improved expense ratio, partially offset by higher non catastrophe property losses in middle and large Commercial. In Personal Lines, core earnings were $21 million, and the underlying combined ratio was 94.1 reflecting increased auto loss costs. We continue to experience inflationary impacts on auto physical damage. We expected to see some moderation in severity trends and to date that has not been the case. Due to these trends and reduce optimism for improvement in the second half of the year, we expect to be a point or two above the high end of the full year personal lines underlying combined ratio range we guided to in February. To put that into perspective, one point is worth about $23 million or $0.07 per share after tax. Doug will comment upon the actions that we continue to take to get more weight into the book. P&C current accident year catastrophes in the second quarter were $123 million before tax, which is $5 million below the prior your period and well below our expectation for typical second quarter catastrophes. P&C prior accident year reserved development was a net favorable $58 million, with workers compensation being the largest contributor. Turning to group benefits; core earnings of $161 million and the 9.8% core earnings margin reflects a lower level of excess mortality losses and growth in fully insured premiums partially offset by an increase in insurance operating costs and a higher disability loss ratio of 66.3 compared to 64.2 in the 2021 period. This increase is primarily due to a lower risk adjustment benefit recorded in the quarter related to the New York paid family leave program. The long term disability loss ratio in the quarter was in line with prior year reflecting claim recoveries and a stabilization of claim instance. All cost excess mortality in the quarter was a benefit of $5 million before tax compared to $25 million of expense in the prior year quarter. The $5 million reduction included $90 million of excess mortality with days of loss in the second quarter, and $24 million of favorable development from first quarter 2022 claims. Turning to Hartford funds, due to equity market declines and higher interest rates daily average AUM decreased during the quarter to $137 billion, resulting in core earnings of $44 million compared to $50 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our investment portfolio delivered another strong quarter. Net investment income was $541 million benefiting from annualized limited partnership returns of 17.3%. Two Commercial real estate sales totaling $51 million in gains were material contributors to LP returns as was strong results from private equity, which is generally reported on a quarter lag. We've been very pleased with the performance of LPs in the first half of the year. Given the evolving macroeconomic outlook, in combination with a mix of Commercial real estate, private equity, and other Limited Partnership holdings, we anticipate that annualized LP returns in the second half of 2022 could trail our full year annualized target. However, we believe returns in total will be positive in the second half of the year. In the quarter, the total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 3% before tax. With the increase in interest rates and wider credit spreads, the portfolio reinvestment rate was 4.5%, which compares favorably to the average sales and maturity yield of 3.6%. As we have noted previously, net investment income will benefit from higher rates over time, and we would expect ex LP yields to increase 10 to 20 basis points during the second half of the year. Not surprisingly, the portfolio value was also impacted by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. The unrealized loss position of approximately $300 million pretax at March 31, increased to an unrealized loss of approximately $2.4 billion at June 30. The investment portfolio of credit quality remains strong with an average rating of eight plus with insignificant credit impairments, and a small increase of 5 million to the allowance for credit losses for mortgage loans to reflect a growing book and the current economic outlook. So while interest rates and capital markets may remain volatile, we are confident that our high quality and well diversified portfolio will continue to support our financial goals and objectives. The confidence we have in our business's ability to generate free cash flow is also evidenced by our capital management actions. As Chris mentioned, yesterday, the board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3 billion effective August 1 2022 through December 31 2024. This authorization is in addition to the existing authorization, which as of June 30 had approximately $450 million remaining. Our expectation is to complete the existing authorization this year, with the vast majority of the new authorization to be utilized in 2023 and 2024, subject to market conditions. In summary, we have had strong performance in the first six months of the year and believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns. I will now turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thanks, Beth and good morning. The strength of the Hartford's property and casualty business was once again evident in the second quarter. Despite inflationary pressures and lower GDP, our broad product portfolio and specialized underwriting expertise positively impacted the quarter's financial results. Those two factors combined with our distribution, footprint and deep talent base position us well to maintain strong performance going forward. In Commercial lines, we achieved double digit written premium growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Underwriting results were excellent with underlying margin improvement in small Commercial and global specially. Diving deeper into growth, Commercial Lines pricing was fairly consistent with expectations. Written pricing excluding workers compensation was 6.1% about a point lower than first quarter, but continuing to exceed last cost trends across most products. Workers Compensation pricing remain positive but declined slightly. Global specialty pricing markets were more competitive with written price at 5.5% off about two and a half points compared to quarter one. However, pricing in our wholesale book actually ticked up remaining in the high single digits. Notable contributions to an excellent Commercial top line quarter include strong policy retention across markets, our largest new business quarter ever for small Commercial at 201 million, solid new business levels and middle and global specially despite increasing signs of a more competitive market and strong audit premium from robust customer payroll growth. In total, I'm pleased with our growth profile across these components and confident we will continue our disciplined execution. Turning the lost costs, trends were largely in line with expectations. We continue to watch severity across our book, including social inflation, wage growth, supply chain pressures and commodity pricing. All-in our commercial book posted a very strong quarter in first half of 2022. Our small commercial team recorded an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 86.9 for the quarter. Since the first quarter of 2013, small commercial has achieved a sub 90 underlying combined ratio in every quarter except two, global specialties underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a stellar 83.1 their best results since the acquisition and middle and large commercial delivered a solid 92.9. There certainly has been a fair amount of discussion concerning the impact of future economic conditions on our industry, particularly workers compensation. From a top line perspective the data we watch our employment levels and wage growth, which together determine the payroll base for workers compensation. Shifting to the loss ratio, we're focused on the following key metrics; wage growth, which acts as a form of pricing with indemnity payment offsets, changes in worker tenure, which can impact claim frequency and the impact of inflation on medical severity. With respect to medical severity, we believe our long term view of 5% in both pricing and reserving is sufficient to cover the potential for increased severity above the benign trend we've experienced in the past few years. We are well positioned to address these trends head on. Our workers compensation extra year performance has been excellent over the past several years, and the balance sheet is strong. We have also built sophisticated pricing and risk segmentation tools, and expanded data analytics within the organization to successfully underwrite through different economic cycles. Let's switch gears and move to personal lines. Our second quarter underlying combined ratio of 94.1% reflects auto physical damage pressure driven by supply chain related inflation, elevated used car prices and wage increases. In the second quarter, these auto severity trends ran higher than we initially anticipated. Combined with normal seasonality in our book, the second quarter auto accident year loss ratio increased 5.7 points from the first quarter this year. The physical damage increase was two and a half points with the remaining delta normal seasonality. As Beth noted, we expect the continuation of inflation pressure in the back half of 2022 and have moved our original guidance up accordingly. We are pleased that our pricing actions initiated over the past few quarters are starting to take hold. Auto written premium price increases recorded in the quarter eclipsed 4%. Rate actions taken across 39 states in the first half of the year average 5.7%. In Home, overall loss costs were in line with both the first quarter and our expectations. Non-cat weather frequency, although higher than the prior year, continues to run favorable to long term averages, offsetting elevated large bar losses and material and labor costs which remain at historically high levels. We are also taken pricing actions in home with written pricing at 9% for the quarter. Given all these factors, I've remained pleased with both our year-to-date current accident year home loss ratio of 63.3% and combined ratio of 94.2%. Turning to Production, written premium growth was nearly flat with steady retention and new business growth of 5.6% in the quarter. We're seeing a significant increase in responses driven by our digital marketing programs, and increased consumer shopping in the 50 plus age cohort. With that said, I would characterize our personalized growth attitude as cautiously optimistic based on the current risk profile of the segment and the opportunities available in the market. Prevail is currently available in 16 states including launches of Florida in January, Texas in April and three more states this month. We have also launched expanded self service capabilities demonstrating our digital customer commitment in the space. Year-to-date prevail new business premium was 36 million with conversion rates at expectations, and we continue to be pleased with the quality of our new business. In addition, our redesigned telematic offering is available in 16 states and will be launched in additional states as Prevail rolls out. Our initial results, including consumer interest, online adoption and enrollment are all trending ahead of expectations. Summarizing this farm results for property and casualty, our commercial lines business maintain a double digit growth rate with exceptional operating margins and in personal lines, while auto severity is pressuring loss ratios, pricing actions are getting stronger and increasing contributions from prevail add to our momentum. As I wrap up my comments today, let me step back and provide a bit of perspective from my operating seat here at The Hartford. Neither we nor our competitors can control the external forces or economic trends that will occur in the future. However, we can control our preparation and our response to various likely or possible scenarios. I firmly believe The Harford has never been better positioned to aggressively take advantage of opportunities, while mitigating the downside risks. My confidence comes from our broadened product portfolio, responsive to solving broker and customer needs. The enhanced underwriting and deep analytic capabilities that deliver competitive advantages and lead to outstanding financial results, strength and technology and digital tools that have improved our competitiveness over the past 10 years. And an investor agenda that is cutting edge and as forward leaning as anything I see in the marketplace. In short, we have transformed the small business marketplace with our innovative and industry leading capabilities. And we are well on our way to achieving the same in middle market space. Global specialty is producing excellent results and will increasingly leverage the competitive tools built within our walls. And finally, Personal Lines is off to a good start with our cloud based product Prevail, which will be pivotal to our future. For these reasons and more, I am bullish about our ability to demonstrate strong execution capabilities in the years ahead. I look forward to our next update in 90 days. Let me now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Doug. Operator, we're prepared to take questions. Operator : Absolutely.  The first question comes from a line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on capital, you guys took off the dividends that you expect from the P&C and the group benefits subs for this year. So should those higher expectations represent baseline or perhaps you could even come in above that we think about the dividends that you could take in 2023 and 2024, as we think about additional capital return from here. Beth Costello : Yes, Elyse I'll take that. We did increase the dividends in P&C and group benefits. Just slightly, I would say the ranges that were providing, I was right, a good basis for thinking about things in the future. And I wouldn't at this point, point to an expectation of increasing will those will comment on you know, 23 and, and beyond when we get there. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, so my second question on pricing, the 6.1% that you guys gave in commercial excluding workers comp. Is that pure rate? Or does that include exposure as it is pure rate? Could you give us the exposure piece as well? Doug Elliot : Elyse, this is Doug. So the 6.1 is consistent with all our former pricing metrics over the last decade and includes an element of exposure that works against loss trends. So it is not complete exposure. But there's an element we call all other insurance included in that noted in our definition, the supplement. And that's about a point and a half overall. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. You may proceed. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. So the first question, I focus on your top line, and maybe more on the commercial side than the personal line side. But you're generating strong growth. And, there seems to be some concern in the marketplace that, this is as good as it's going to get. And so I thought maybe you could, and you did provide a lot of detail in your comments. But if you could give us a sense of how the market can sustain itself and you continue to generate these substantial growth rates, for the intermediate term. What you're seeing in market in your specific segments that'd be helpful. Doug Elliot : Sure, Greg. Just a few thoughts to add to what I share to my script. Number one, the new business strength is evident across all our markets, particularly in small, as I noted, our first quarter over $200 million. I think that momentum will continue. And a lot of it is driven by some of the new products we've built over the past couple of years. Secondly, in small, you see that PIF count. So we're growing PIF count, not just a pricing audit premium dynamic. We feel very positive about our PIF count. We've talked to you about cross-sell in the past. So across the franchise we believe we're in a much better shape to handle a more complete set of customer challenges. So I love our complete piece there. And then as we've commented in the past, we are right now in a pretty positive spot relative to audit exposures as it relates to workers' compensation. So we do have some tailwind at us, particularly in middle and large commercial and also small commercial that's providing a little bit extra positive momentum in our growth. Beth, anything you or Chris want to add? Chris Swift : I would just say Greg, I wouldn't underestimate Doug's point on cross selling, particularly with an expanded set of specialty products into small commercial into middle and large cooperation that we have as a team and really, the knowledge and confidence that our distribution partners are gaining in our broadened capability. So, Doug, I think you used the word bullish, which describes my tone equally, is that what we can continue to do in our in our commercial line space? Greg Peters : Just a clarification on your answer. I mean, the success in this small commercial is obvious. When I think about in we're not in recession, but when I think about the potential depends on whose view you're talking about. But if we go into a bigger recession, I view that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more risk on the small commercial side than the larger commercial side. But maybe I've got it sideways. Any comments on that? Chris Swift : You mean, from a risk of economic slowdown? Greg Peters : Yes. Which businesses might perform be more challenged in, if there's a slowdown? Chris Swift : Well, again, I think we saw during the first phase of the pandemic there was a disproportionate amount of slowdown in small business, Doug. Whether we get to ever that point again, Greg, remember, I mean that was such a unique environment where the economy basically shut down. People weren't traveling; they weren't going out to small businesses. They weren't going out to restaurants. They just weren't -- they were hunkered down. So I think that's 1 extreme. And the other extreme is just particularly with inflation, people are going to have to think about disposable income differently and activities that could impact a certain level of small business, Doug, but I wouldn't see anything like what we experienced during the pandemic. Doug Elliot : Chris, I'd only add that as we watch the indicators, new business starts the health of that, through the middle part of July, looks very strong still. Remind you, Greg, that the Fortune 1000, although an important segment, we are not out balance that direction. So, our portfolio runs across Middle, strong and middle, small, etcetera. And when I think about the labor market, there still seems to be high demand for top labor. So from a comp perspective, I'm still optimistic that as we go through the next several quarters, we will perform our products will be marketed. And I'm holding optimism as I kind of move into Q3. Greg Peters : Got it? Just a second question I had was just around, Doug you comment about your inflation factors and the assumptions you're using? One of the numbers that you cited was I think it was medical severity, you said 5% compared with what was a benign trend to me, that suggests that there's a degree of caution in your inflation factors that you're using relative to what you're seeing currently. But I don't want to put words in your mouth, and it's clearly an area of focus of the street. So maybe you can add some more color to that. That's my last question. Doug Elliot : Yes, so maybe just a few thoughts on last chat in general been a lot of discussion about it, and we're spending a lot of time here at the company. I mentioned a long term medical inflation ticker five. We've not moved off that for several years. Yes, we have seen some care of benign medical inflation over the last couple of years but our view is that through the longer period, it's prudent for us to hold those picks. And if you looked at our workers comp triangles, you've seen that we've been very steady, right? This quarter, we had some releases in comp, but really 2018, primarily and behind. So our 19 through 21 years are still holding them, we are watching to make sure that we've got all our calls in a row. I would also say to you that, the aggregate number by company, you've got to look at the mix of business, where we play where others mix by line of business. So we've got strong loss trend picks, and our excess casualty trends, trends that run from 9 to 13 property, commercial auto, so, our books does tend to mix a little smaller than some that we compete with. But I feel like we've got very solid loss trend picks in our across commercial and personal lines where we see something we address it like we did this quarter with personal lines. But, I think we have a prudent process that's been diligent and responsive to what we see in our last triangles. And we're pricing accordingly. Beth Costello : I would agree. And back to the specific question, again, Greg that you had a medical inflation index is that we just we haven't changed that long term view. So the fact that we're saying 5%, compared to what has been benign in the last several years that's not new, and not reflective of a change and how we think about that trend. Greg Peters : It's good detail. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from a line of Brian Meredith with UBS. You may proceed. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Just following up with a little bit, I'm wondering if you could tell us where that 6.1% written premium stands versus kind of what your current trend and expected trend assumptions are. And in that context, you believe that most your book kind of is rate adequate. But particularly when I look at the middle and global specialty business. Doug Elliot : Yes Brian, I think Chris commented in his earlier remarks that we think we're about 100 basis points on top of our call for loss trend in 2022. So that's where we sit relative to the 6.1. We consistently look at that. You can imagine this is an evolving item. But really, as I commented, our loss picks for the year our loss trends for the year, haven't moved a lot in commercial over the past two quarters. They've moved in personal but we're watchful that and we're particularly careful in terms of the potential recession that may be in front of us, but we'll wait and see and make those calls as conditions change. Brian Meredith : Yes, I'm sorry, maybe what I meant is that, the 100 basis points or her crew saying, is that better or worse than kind of what you're currently seeing right now. I understand this, what you're pricing for and what you're actually seeing in your book right now. Doug Elliot : I think that's basically what we're seeing right now. I would call that up a pretty dynamic view as of today. Brian. Chris Swift : That's the spot view as of June 30 Brian. Doug Elliot : Yes, it's the written view. So I'll give you a written current view of pricing and a view of the last run. Yes. Brian Meredith : Got you. Got you. Makes sense. And then just quickly on the personal auto severity. I wonder if you could drill in a little bit more into that, what's going on there. Another company talked about an issue with respect to late paying claims, meaning it's taking a lot longer to actually get claims paid out and that, that's created some issues with respect to inflationary factors affecting your PD part of your auto. Are you seeing similar type of stuff? Doug Elliot : Well, we certainly have been watchful of courts coming out of the recessionary period, 2020 and 2021. So I would say that it's a high watch area. But in terms of our triangles, I don't think we're seeing any data that is surprising to us. What we are dealing with at the moment is a is dam environment, used car, labor and other issues that has caused us to change our picks. And we've changed them obviously appreciably in the second quarter, and we'll watch what happens in the third quarter, which is why we moved our guidance, Brian. Chris Swift : But the time to repair, Doug, from a supply chain side is extended. So it means potentially rental cars being rented longer. I don't have the exact number of days in front of me that we've extended out the time to repair a car, Brian, but it is extending. Brian Meredith : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. You may proceed. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks good morning. Just a question on the specialty underlying combined ratio improvement in commercial lines. Could you just talk about how much the 7 point year-over-year improvement was coming from the expense ratio versus the underlying loss ratio? And then maybe just comment if this is a full underlying combined ratio to think about going forward. Doug Elliott : Yes, David, let me start. I think annually, the 7 point change is roughly 4-ish points of loss and 3 points expense. I thought you were going to ask about the quarter 1 versus 2. I think that in quarter 1, we had some risks relative to Russia-Ukraine that we booked losses for us. So that really does explain the 2022 roll between quarter 2 and quarter 1, but I shared with you the 4 and 3 components of the 7 from last year. Q - David Motemaden : Got it. And yes, it's definitely lower than where we've seen over the last 5 or 6 quarters. Is that a -- and obviously, there's been rate earning in excess of trend. Is that a level the 83% to kind of think about going forward? Is there anything one-off that's flattering that? Doug Elliott : I don't feel one-off at the moment. I do feel very pleased about the progress we've made. It's a result of not only aggressive and sustained pricing over the last couple of years, but also underwriting actions. We've been taking underwriting actions throughout our book internationally and domestically. So I'm very pleased about all of that. I do feel like that specialty business should sustain and have significant profit contributions to our company, and we expect that to continue, and we hope to grow that business and become a bigger part of our franchise over time. Chris Swift : David, I'd remind you that specialty book is almost approaching $3 billion, and it's a diversified book of D&L I would say some surety on London exposures, casualty. So yes, I'm really proud of what the teams worked hard at over the year since we acquired it. And it feels gratifying that from a strategic point of view, it's performing at this high level. Doug Elliott : David, I'd add just maybe 1 other thought over the last three years. We spent a lot of time on integration and feel good about that progress. We have pivoted over the last six months and are now working harder on data analytics. So the work relative to data science and analytics and how we evolve those pricing models and beat in the marketplace. Those are some of the reasons that I have optimism that we will continue to be an excellent top-tier player in specialty. And so I think our future is bright there, and I really believe we're just getting started. David Motemaden : Got it. I appreciate that color. And then for my follow-up, so you gave us the approximately 5% loss trend. That was excluding -- What is it -- if you include comp? Just out of curiosity, I know you said 5% for severity, but that doesn't include the frequency on comps. So yes, I guess just what was the -- what is the loss trend that you guys are picking to if I just include workers' comp within Commercial Lines? Doug Elliott : Yes, David, we don't share that number. But you're right, it would be down slightly. And then that comes to our frequency call on comp, which we don't share externally. But we talked about it, it's been very, very moderate. In fact, over the past couple of years, we've had extended periods of negative frequency. So that's too much data to share with a couple of our competitors, but our book continues to perform. We watch frequency carefully. I think our calls are appropriate, and it's a line that we know well and we'll continue to compete effectively over time. David Motemaden : Okay. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Michael Phillips : Thanks, good morning. Similar question on the other segment in commercial lines. The middle and large commercial was the only segment there that had a little bit of it arose in your core loss rate, our core combined ratio and a little bit of uptick sequentially the last few quarters. So I guess is there anything there in the rate or trend dynamics or anything else kind of one-off that would account for that? Doug Elliott : Yes. Mike, in the quarter, we did have a one-off and had a large property loss and some reinsurance reinstatement associated. So that was the cause a couple of points inside middle just from that one loss. I think those things are episodic. They happen over time in the property space, nothing at this point more than that. Michael Phillips : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I guess, back to comp you took favorable development. You guys feel you're very conservative in your current reserves. But I guess we can hone in on 2020, the 2020 accident year for a second. That year still has the highest loss pick of any surrounding years. And a large part of that is because of your IBNR piece. So I guess I'm curious, is there a severity issue you're worried about for those -- for that year, given what's happened during COVID? Or is there something else that makes you a little more concerned or maybe just cautious I don't know the level you've taken development in 2020 accident year, but claim counts are down significantly to 20%, 30% in that year, yet your reserves are still pretty strong. So maybe it's just extra conservatism, but is there anything else that maybe makes you a little cautious on that at there? Thanks. ChrisSwift: Well, Michael, it's Chris. I appreciate the question, and I'll ask Beth to add her color in a minute. But yes, I think that's been our consistent philosophy of trying to be prudent with reserves and picks and I think we've used the phrase over the years let it season and obviously release any benefits that occur. So I would just say it's a natural process. But particularly during the COVID years, we were very sensitive to any known unknowns or no unknowns depending on how you want to think about it. But yes, Beth, I feel good about the overall balance sheet and particularly the comp line. Don't you? Beth Costello : Yes, I would agree. And as we look again specifically at the 2020 year, obviously a lot of distortion because of COVID. And so our view is to be cautious. And as Chris said, let those years season a bit before we make any adjustments. Michael Phillips : Okay. So just to clarify, are you not seeing any higher severity kind of average severity claims that exist in that year? Or is it more of kind of waiting to see that maybe there could be late reported claims or just general cautious? Chris Swift : I think you characterized it right. It's just -- it is an app pattern year, and we're just being generally cautious until it fully seasons to our judgment. Michael Phillips : Okay, thank you. That holds. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Paul Newsome : Good morning. I was wondering to ask you a little bit on the personal lines side, you are obviously raising rates like most are. Any pushback you're seeing that's different than normal from the regulators in terms of getting rates. We've seen a lot of press suggesting that some states are pushing back. Doug Elliott : Well, I think that that's a fair comment. I also would say that we are very effective relationships with all of the states. So it's an active process. It's actually been an active process, as you know since the third quarter of last year. I'm encouraged by the momentum. I think as we move through the next two quarters, that momentum will continue to pick up and quite bullish about what we're going to see in the supplement in Q3 and Q4, so encouraged about that. But yes, there are lots of things that we manage our way through state by state, and I think it's just part of the process. Paul Newsome : And then maybe to beat a dead horse a little bit. Any further thoughts on kind of social inflation and some of the -- there are some movements in reserves and general liability, and we had some companies missed their financial for example, with excess casualty issues, large losses in casualty. And I was wondering if you're seeing anything of that nature and maybe how we should be more confident in the accident loss picks for liabilities not necessarily going up. Chris Swift : Paul, I'll start and then Doug and Beth can add their commentary. I think we've commented in the past on social inflation that it's not a new phenomenon. We've had many years of experience, particularly with mass torts and some of the claims that we had to deal with. We got a world class claims organization that has got a deep, deep expertise in handling casualty exposures of this sort. But yes, as the courts reopen, we do believe that there will be at least a clearing of the existing inventory and we'll have to see what trends emerge at a point in time. I don't think there's any new trends as we sit here today that we're really, really concerned about. We've talked about some of our reviver status issues or  issues that we think we've put behind us. But jury awards are going up. No doubt about it. It's clear in our data. That's why when Doug talks about casualty loss picks in the 9% to 13% range we're trying to be prudent and reflect what we think is continued activity of just larger awards. But Doug but, as we sit here today there's nothing new coming out of our book at this point in time. Beth Costello : Yes, I would agree with that comment. Overall, I mean, we did increase slightly from prior year reserves for general liability. But it was really just a handful of, I would call them, one-off losses that as we made our final judgments for the quarter, thought that it was prudent to book a bit more in those lines as a percentage of the overall carried reserves in those lines, very, very small. So again, not indicative of a trend that's different from what we've seen, just wanted to be cautious, as I said as we closed out the quarter. Paul Newsome : Great. Thank you and congratulations on the quarters result. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. You may proceed. Joshua Shanker : Yes, thank you for taking my question. The first is the first quarter since 1Q 2016 where you didn't lose any auto policies net, and that's a good accomplishment. Although it could also mean that your pricing is more attractive to a consumer right now than a lot of opportunities in the marketplace. To what extent have you secured the customer group you want in your personal lines business that they have a stickiness that you can raise prices on that that will stay? And to what extent do you think that even though you have to put more price than through, so you're not particularly disadvantaged on the pricing side at this moment? Doug Elliott : Josh, a very insightful question. And I can just share with you, given our new platform, the metrics and analytics that we're watching flow, where we're winning, quality of the book, had a whole series of diagnostics laid out in terms of expectations going in state by state. We're watching that match week by week. So I can tell you it's an exhaustive process. Everything we can see, we look like we expected and hoped to look. So again, I think it was a really good question and something that we take seriously and working our tails off out here. Joshua Shanker : Okay. And then in the prepared remarks, Chris spoke about some new technologies you have on the benefit enrollment platform to increase enrollment and whatnot. To what extent are these unique offerings in the market? And to what extent can you leverage them to gain share with employers? Chris Swift : Thanks, Josh. Yes, we have rolled out some new capabilities to have a better enrollment experience. Again I think a lot of the things that we do across the organization we think we're leading the way. But we know it's a competitive marketplace and a lot of fast followers that can replicate new things that come to the market, Josh. But as evidenced by our strong earned premium growth, I think the group benefit, the better days of group benefit are still ahead of it as far as a real need for the products that we offer and particularly some of the voluntary offerings we have of medical supplement, critical illness, accidental activities are really increasing and those carry strong profit margins for us. So I think that the whole equation is coming together and then our continued investment in our broad based digital capabilities and I feel really good about where we're positioned today, Josh. Joshua Shanker : Very well. Thank you for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. You may proceed. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. I also have some top line questions. You showed nice growth in small commercial. And as the economy is reopening, I'm wondering if these new businesses lack operating history and its risk that typically reside in the E&S market? Doug Elliott : Tracy, I would suggest to you that we're watching claim intake by segment for maturity of worker. We are expanding and have worked at expanding our appetite in small. We do have an excess and surplus offering. But I don't think our book is trending to E&S. I still think it is very high quality. We've got a series of metrics that help us score our book. And so from every angle that we can see and evaluate, I think we have an outstanding book of business. But yes, in general, we are now pushing ourselves outside of what I might say would be a historically conservative risk appetite, Chris, to a little more bold, and maybe bold is too aggressive a word. But certainly, we're looking at other cells where we've not competed aggressively in history, and I think you'll see us with product in that space. ChrisSwift: Doug, I would also observe, given our monthly reviews we do together, we're doing it thoughtfully. We're doing it with a primary product. We're also adding more global specialty product particularly, I would say, the E&O capabilities into a small. So yes, Tracy, we're trying to trying to be the most relevant player in the small business segment as we can be and maintaining our discipline and profitability focus. Tracy Benguigui : Excellent. That's great feedback. I also had a question on the auto pit flat sequentially. I'm wondering, are you looking at the policy life cycle where maybe right now, you're not earning an adequate return, but you feel good about the businesses three, four years from now, you could earn acceptable return. And to what extent it's prevail playing into that discount? Is it material yet? Doug Elliott : Yes, the life cycle component is a heart of our process for sure. So we're looking at current rate adequacy. We're also looking at our retentions and our profiles of customers. So I would agree with you that policy life cycle profitability is something that is an important part of that measure. Tracy Benguigui : And the Prevail piece is that maybe dampening the  decline? Doug Elliott : Yes. Consistent. Tracy Benguigui : Yes. Okay... Doug Elliott : Yes, I would say that Prevail would be adopting some of those best practices that we've used historically in our personal lines pricing. Chris Swift : Tracy, Prevail is -- platform, right? It's the platform, it's the products, it's the digital capabilities that we're bringing to the market. But remember our book of business in auto and home, we've enjoyed $3.5 billion of premium over the years so that lifetime cycle that you're talking about is deeply embedded into our capabilities and how product season, how customers green. Remember, we have more flexibility today with Prevail because we have no lifetime guarantees so that the funnel that we had open for new business in the old days when we have lifetime guarantees, needed to be very restrictive because you in essence, we're marrying that customer for potentially a long time. So the flexibility we have with Prevail is dramatically different, but the methodology in our thinking, Doug, is very consistent. Doug Elliott : And I would add Chris, six month policies, too right? We had much more flexibility to deal with changes in the event that we make adjustments to our strategy. Tracy Benguigui : Yes, I'm sorry I guess I was referring to the non-AARP as you're trying to market that demographic, right? ChrisSwift: No, not at this time. I mean, our core focus is ARP members. We do have some small agency business. It's very small, but it's still accretive to the organization. But the main focus, Doug, is been on serving a broader segment of AARP members, particularly 50 to 65 year olds that we're deeply partnered with the AARP organization in growing that membership base. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Alex Scott : Hey, thanks for taking me at the end of the call here. First one I had is on net investment income. I mean, certainly it was a good quarter. If I set aside the LPs, just noticing the yield was more or less flat year-over-year. And so I was just interested if you could provide any color around sort of where new money yields are and if there's anything we should be considering about how that may start to trend up. Beth Costello : Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. So as I said we do anticipate to see the yield ex-LPs to continue to increase. I may have you look at some of the details that we have in our investor financial supplement that show you some of the other lines besides just fixed maturities that contribute to that. So we do have some equity funds that had albeit small negative marks this quarter, but that also impacted the compare year-over-year. But when I look at just the fixed maturity yield, we are seeing the pickup as, again, new money yields are outpacing what we're seeing from a sales and maturity perspective. Alex Scott : Got it. And then on group benefits, is there still pressure at all that you were feeling this quarter on the expense side. I just -- that's been elevated with handling so many claims and so forth. Is that more or less wound down at this point? Or anything I should be considering around the expense base as we move forward, hopefully, with maybe less elevated claims? Chris Swift : Yes. I think that claim comment you made, Alex, is the key. We're probably -- we are carrying excess staff to remain cautious if there's another surge of COVID. Obviously, we're dealing with obviously very good mortality trends. But particularly in our STD book, we are carrying excess capacity just to see how things play out for the fall in the winter season. And then I would also say that -- so that's a temporal item you could characterize. But the increase in IT spend particularly in digital and some of the other things that we're investing in is also evident in there. That's probably for the next couple of years, there's a couple of big projects that we want to complete in that area. So the IT spend might remain elevated. But as we grow our top line, though, we do have expectation that expense ratios will start to moderate and improve as we grow. But where we're at for the first six months of the year, I think, is a pretty good full year run rate. Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to pass the conference on over to the management team for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes The Hartford second quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Alex, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Susan Spivak, with The Hartford Group. Susan, please go ahead. Susan Spivak : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on third quarter 2022 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our website.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for one year. I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The Hartford produced a strong third quarter with core earnings of $471 million or $1.44 per diluted share which includes the impact of Hurricane Ian and the ongoing effects of a dynamic macroeconomic environment. Before discussing our results in detail, I wanted to extend our thoughts and prayers to all those impacted by Hurricane Ian, a powerful and devastating storm. It is in moments like this that I am especially proud of our Hartford's claims team. To date, we have inspected approximately 95% of all claims submitted and had issued initial payments on 50% of those claims. Over the coming months, our team will continue to work tirelessly to help all our customers affected by the storm. Nearly a year ago at our Investor Day, we told you how confident I was in our portfolio, capabilities, expertise, talent, and our ability to deliver consistent and sustainable returns. As we look back, the clearest proof point that our strategy is working is our financial performance. In the first 9 months of 2022, we delivered core earnings growth of 18% and core EPS growth of 27%, top line growth in Commercial Lines of 12%. At Commercial, underlying combined ratio of 88.6, a group benefits core earnings margin of 5.9%. We returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders and yesterday announced a 10% dividend increase. And we also produced a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.3%. These are terrific results that reflect The Hartford's performance-based culture and demonstrate why despite the continued headwinds of inflation and economic uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute at a high level. In Commercial Lines, we remain disciplined and prudent in establishing loss picks. We continue to have approximately 100 basis points of spread between renewal written pricing and loss trends excluding workers' compensation. Our Small Commercial results continue to be exceptional. NextGen Spectrum, our market-leading business owners product, is fueling much of our new business success as we gain market share at very favorable margins. The digital customer experience we provide in Small Commercial is a significant competitive advantage for customers, agents and brokers as it provides a fast, intuitive and efficient platform for doing business. The most recent Small Commercial Keynova study ranks us number one in digital capabilities for the fourth consecutive year. Our score climbed 4 points and we are now 20 points higher than our closest competitor. Middle and large commercial is benefiting tremendously from the combination of deep industry specialization and product breadth, leading to new business growth and improving loss and retention ratios. We are confident that our data science, pricing segmentation and claims execution will continue to support underwriting discipline. In global specialty, results are outstanding. Underwriting margins have improved materially over the last three years. Execution has never been stronger and the enhanced underwriting expertise we bring to the market is strengthening our competitive position and driving market share gains. In personal lines, we continue to take pricing actions as higher inflation impacts results. As Doug will describe, we continue to file for increasing rate changes across our book to restore profitability. Overall, I am confident we have the right strategy and execution in personal lines. Turning to group benefits. In the quarter, core earnings were $117 million, with a margin of 7.2% reflecting lower excess mortality and strong disability results. Long-term disability trends are stable and within our expectations for incidence rates and recoveries. Modestly higher expenses reflect increased investments in capabilities, including digital, claims automation and administrative platforms. Fully insured ongoing premiums were up 6% compared with the third quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in exposure on existing accounts, as well as strong persistency in sales. Fully insured ongoing sales were $106 million in the quarter, up 29%, with increases in both group disability and group life. In many ways, the fundamentals of the group benefits business are stronger than prior to the pandemic. Product awareness is greater as both employers and employees are highly engaged on benefit offerings, with growing demand for supplemental products. This is an opportunity for us to deliver higher value and create a differentiated experience for our customers. And lastly, investment results were healthy in the quarter and are beginning to reflect the rising rate environment, which will earn in more meaningfully in 2023. Taking a step back, I want to touch upon some overarching themes. First, the impact of inflationary pressures and changing weather patterns on pricing and loss costs. Second, the positive impacts of the current interest rate environment. And third, the importance of a healthy and balanced insurance regulatory system that ensures stability and predictability for all. As we have discussed over the last several quarters across the industry, carriers are dealing with elevated inflation related to goods, services and most components used in manufacturing. These inflationary pressures are likely to remain as the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy and despite some early signs of reduced demand and economic output. At the same time, changing weather patterns continue to drive increased frequency of events and associated claims severity. While there is no silver bullet to fix this problem, ongoing efforts to build more resilient homes, communities and commercial properties needs to be an ongoing focus of policymakers, insurers, agents and carriers. Taken together, these trends point to the need to maintain underwriting discipline and ensure pricing keeps pace with loss trends and reserving assumptions. As long as these trends continue, rates will need to rise and in some cases, will reaccelerate pricing increases over the near to medium term. The Hartford is committed to maintaining price discipline, and we have clearly communicated to all our underwriters the need to expand or maintain margins ex workers' comp, while prudently growing our book of business. Because interest rates are expected to remain elevated, we anticipate our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, will increase by approximately 50 basis points to 60 basis points in 2023 compared to full year 2022, which will benefit earnings. Finally, on the regulatory front, our state-based system of insurance regulation has generally served customers and the industry well, although at times, has experienced instability in certain jurisdictions and across certain product lines. At its core, the mission of insurance regulation is to protect consumers while ensuring a stable market, one that fosters market competition and safeguard's carrier solvency. Balancing these two aspects of the regulatory mission is critical to ensuring widely available and affordable insurance. Recently, we have seen instances where regulation has become politicized creating instability in the market and upsetting the balance of the regulatory system is designed to achieve. Recall on policymakers to respect the insurance regulatory framework, take the necessary steps to address rising legal system abuse, rate inadequacy and persistent underinsured exposures while working with the industry to support a well-functioning marketplace where insurers get the coverage they need and carriers secure an appropriate return for the risk they undertake. As a company, whose purpose is to underwrite human achievement, The Hartford stands ready to engage on these issues actively and constructively. Before I close, last month, we announced the retirement of Doug Elliott as The Hartford's President at the end of the year. Beth and I have worked together with Doug and the entire Hartford team over the past decade to transform The Hartford and build the foundation for our company's future success. Doug was instrumental in expanding our product -- suite of products, developing industry-specific verticals within our Property & Casualty business, overseeing the integration of the Navigators Group and elevating our underwriting excellence. Thanks to Doug's strong leadership, The Hartford is well positioned for profitable growth in the years ahead as we build on the momentum created to best serve all of our agents and brokers and customers. I want to thank Doug for his many contributions to our company. Thank you, Doug. Doug leaves us many gifts, including a seasoned group of executives who are going to continue our high-level performance. I have tremendous confidence in the talents, skills and focus of this leadership team. In closing, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. These results demonstrate our strategy and the investments we have made in our businesses have established The Hartford as a proven and consistent performer. We have outstanding execution capabilities and exceptional talent that drives my confidence in our ability to continue to produce superior returns. We are managing the investment portfolio prudently and all holdings are well balanced across diversified asset classes. And we are proactively managing our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders. All these factors underpin my confidence that we will continue to meet or exceed our core earnings ROE objectives. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $471 million or $1.44 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.3%. Before reviewing the results by segment, I will cover the impacts in the quarter of catastrophes and specifically, Hurricane Ian. We recognized catastrophe losses of $293 million with Hurricane Ian losses of $214 million. In Commercial Lines, Ian losses were $133 million, including $35 million in Global Re. In Personal Lines, losses were $81 million, of which about 72% were auto losses, which reflects our market share in the regions impacted as well as a higher average loss per claim due in part to inflationary pressures. Moving on to segment results. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $363 million and written premium growth was 10%, reflecting written pricing increases and exposure growth along with an increase in new business in Small and Middle and Large Commercial as well as increased policy count retention in Small Commercial. The underlying combined ratio of 89.3 was up 2.1 points from the prior year third quarter, primarily due to several non-catastrophe property losses. In Personal Lines, core loss of $28 million and the underlying combined ratio was 95.9, reflecting continued increased severity in both auto and homeowners partially offset by earned pricing increases and a lower expense ratio in both lines. P&C prior accident year reserve development was a net favorable $53 million with workers' compensation being the largest contributor. Turning to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $117 million and a 7.2% core earnings margin reflects a lower level of excess mortality losses and growth in fully insured premiums. The disability loss ratio was flat to the prior year quarter, reflecting lower COVID-19-related short-term disability losses. And in long-term disability, higher estimates of claim recoveries were more than offset by less favorable incidence trends compared to the prior year quarter, but in line with our expectations. All cost excess mortality was $26 million before tax compared to $212 million in the prior year quarter. The $26 million included $14 million with days of loss in the third quarter and $12 million of losses related to prior quarters. Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings were $47 million, reflecting lower daily average AUM, which decreased primarily due to equity market declines and higher interest rates. Net investment income was $487 million. The annualized limited partnership return was 6.3% in the quarter. We have been very pleased with the performance of LPs in the first 9 months of the year and expect the full year return to be at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% range. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 3.3% before tax, a 30 basis point increase in the second quarter, and we expect another 10 basis points to 20 basis points improvement in the fourth quarter. Investment portfolio credit quality remain strong at average rating of 8 plus. During quarter we recognized minor losses on sales of fixed maturities as we\u2019ve reduced portfolio duration and modestly reduce risk and portfolio. So while interest rates and capital markets may remain volatile, we are confident that our high-quality and well-diversified portfolio will continue to support our financial goals and objectives. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares for $350 million. As of September 30, we have $3.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We were also pleased to announce a 10% increase in our common quarterly dividend payable on January 4. This is the 10th increase in the dividend in the last decade and another proof point of the consistent capital generation of the company. In summary, we had strong performance in the first 9 months of the year and believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns. I will now turn the call over to Doug. Doug Elliot : Thanks, Beth, and good morning, everyone. Across our Property & Casualty business, we continue to be well positioned to sustain industry-leading financial performance. The strength of our broad product portfolio and underwriting execution are evident in our excellent year-to-date top line growth of 9% and sub-90 underlying combined ratio. In addition, the relative size of our Ian loss is further proof of that underwriting discipline. In Commercial Lines, we achieved double-digit written premium growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, and underlying results remain strong even with some volatility in our non-CAT, non-weather property results. Diving deeper into third quarter growth, U.S. standard Commercial Lines written pricing, excluding workers' compensation, was up about 0.5 point to 6.7%. Pricing increases in auto and property correspond with comparable inflationary increases. And in the coming months, we may see further improved pricing in these lines. Workers' compensation pricing remained positive, benefiting from wage rate growth. Within Global Specialty, rate for the quarter of 3.2% was down about 2 points from the second quarter driven primarily by excess public D&O. For most of Global Specialty lines, pricing was in the mid to high single digits and in the aggregate ahead of loss trends with very strong accident year results. As Chris highlighted, in total for Commercial, excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing is still about 100 basis points above long-term loss trends. In addition to positive pricing, Commercial Lines top line growth benefited from strong new business in Small Commercial and Middle Market, up 15% and 8%, respectively. Our industry-leading products and digital capabalities when its Small Commercial continue to drive excellent growth. As evidence by a terrific $190 million new business quarter. Retention moments strong across markets and continue written premium momentum from customer payroll growth was another bright spot. Within Small Commercial at certain evidence of our broadened appetite, we're particularly proud the capabilities we're building in the excess and surplus line space. By the end of this year, written premiums will likely exceed $100 million. Going forward, we expect to become a leading destination for binding opportunities, a strong complement to our existing retail offering. In addition, we're leveraging Small Commercial's underwriting and digital expertise to capture a lower complexity business in both Middle Market and Global Specialty and expect to take advantage of the growing technological developments implemented by our top brokers. Turning to the loss ratio. Results were largely in line with our range of expectations. In property coming off a favorable third quarter of 2021, fire loss frequency was a bit elevated in the quarter. With respect to workers' compensation, indemnity severity remains in line with wage rate growth and actual medical severity trends are well within our long-term assumption of 5%. Our liability lines continue to perform consistent with our expectations, and we are dialed in on social and economic inflation trends. Closing out the commercial discussion, I'm really pleased with the results we posted this quarter. Small Commercial continues to deliver superior operating results. Global Specialties underwriting -- underlying margins improved 2.4 points from a year ago to a strong 84.5 and Middle/Large Commercial delivered a solid 93.7. We move into the fourth quarter from a position of financial strength, both in terms of accident year performance and balance sheet adequacy. Let's switch gears and move to Personal Lines. Our third quarter underlying combined ratio of 95.9 reflects continued auto physical damage severity pressure driven by elevated repair costs related to supply chain and higher labor rates. In response to those loss trends, we have been increasing pricing since the fourth quarter of last year to ensure rate adequacy and overall profitability. Auto rate filings have averaged mid-single digits through the first 9 months of this year with renewal pricing of 5% in the quarter, up 1 point from second quarter. Filed rates will move to double digits during the fourth quarter, and we expect mid-teens for the first half of 2023. In home, overall loss results were in line with our expectations. Non-CAT weather frequency continues to run favorable to long-term averages, mitigating material and labor costs, which remain at historically high levels. We continue taking written pricing actions with home at nearly 12% for the quarter. Turning to production. Written premium grew 5% for the quarter, largely reflecting pricing increases from both auto and home. Auto policies in force were flat to the third quarter of 2021 and up 1% from this year's 2Q. We will be prudent with growth, balancing rate adequacy, quality of new business and marketing productivity. Before I close, let me share with you a few thoughts about our recent participation in the Annual CIAB conference. Common feedback centered on the complementary strategies across our businesses, strong cross-sell execution and excellent risk collaboration. Our position and engagement with the top brokers has never been stronger, and there are many exciting initiatives underway as our teams pursue deeper penetration with these partners. In closing, I remain bullish about the future of our Property & Casualty business. As I shared with you last quarter, my confidence comes from our broadened and responsive product portfolio, the enhanced underwriting and data analytic capabilities we've built and our state-of-the-art technology and digital tools. As I leave the organization at the end of this year, I could not be prouder of the nearly 12 years I've spent here at The Hartford. I am confident my teammates are well prepared to successfully tackle the challenges ahead while delivering consistent, industry-leading profitable growth. I look forward to watching their success in the coming years. Let me now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Doug. Operator, we are ready to take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is open. Alex Scott : First one I had is on the Commercial underlying loss ratio. Just on the year-over-year comparison, I think even adjusting for some of the non-CAT items that you mentioned, it didn't improve all that much. I think it even deteriorated a touch. And I just wanted to see if you could unpack what some of the drivers are. I think there was some mention of workers' comp in the 10-Q is at least a partial driver. So I was just looking to see if you could add some color around how we should think through the year-over-year comparisons there. Beth Costello : Thanks, Alex. I'll start, and I'll let Doug provide some additional cover. So first, I just -- Doug said this in his comments, and I think it's always important when we start a conversation on Small Commercial is by any measure, I think their results are outstanding. As Doug discussed, we did see some impact from property losses, non-CAT, non-weather-related that obviously impacted the compare year-over-year. But when we look at year-to-date where we are compared to what we saw at the beginning of the year, we are right in line. As it relates specifically to the workers' compensation point, again, if you go back to what we were expecting from the beginning of the year, we're very much right in line. We did not make any changes in the quarter as it relates to workers' comp in our loss picks from where we've been from the beginning of this year. And we had said at the beginning of this year that in this line, we expected a small amount of compression in workers' comp, and that's exactly what we've been booking to. And when I say small, less than 0.5 point. Part of the compare to last third quarter and why that was called out was in the last year's third quarter, we had some true-ups in the quarter related to just some favorable frequency and rate coming in a bit higher than we had anticipated. So it's really more about last third quarter, this year and what we're producing overall completely in line with what our expectations were and no changes. Alex Scott : And maybe just a more broad question with my second. I think we've heard a couple of your peers discuss standard lines becoming a bit more competitive. And I think another was commenting on casualty pricing needing to reaccelerate and sort of highlighting the economic exposure potentially beginning to decline and being less of a tailwind. Could you frame for us the way you're thinking about the competitive environment and pricing and what you see needing to happen on the Casualty & Property side from here. Doug Elliot : Alex, I would start by saying that we look at overall performance, and we feel very positive about what we produce for 9 months and look at our position in the quarter and just very pleased about that performance level. Now given the challenges that we all face, as I commented in my script, we are very conscious of both social and economic pressure inside our loss trends and are watching them carefully across all our lines, across all our segments. The other thing I would say is we're coming off a significant natural peril disaster in the southeast part of this country. So we expect that the property market will go through some changes in the coming quarters starting very shortly. So we're in market with our CAT reinsurance program that renews 1/1. Our folks have been in Bermuda all week and expect over the next several weeks that we will talk about that structure. I do not expect anything material to change relative to our reinsurance structure. But I think between property and social and economic changes, it's a really critical time that you stay on top of your trends, and we're trying to do exactly that here at The Hartford. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : I wanted to go back to the Commercial discussion, right? So you guys just a bit above the full year guidance year-to-date. I know there's moving pieces. And when I say a bit, right, it's 10 basis points. Just given that Q4, I think, seasonally does tend to run better than some of the other quarters, would you expect them to be within that guided range for the full year? Doug Elliot : Elyse, we do. So we're expecting to hit guidance. You're right, there is seasonality in our book of business, and so we're mindful of that. But based on what we see today and the early start with October -- very early start of October, we expect to be in that range. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question is on the Group Benefits business. Chris, I think you mentioned some higher expenses there. But if I look at the core margin, excluding COVID, that was nearly 9% in the quarter versus the 6% to 7% target. And you mentioned long-term disability trends are stable. So if we think about the run rate of that group benefits business ex COVID, do you think you guys could exceed that 6% to 7% target margin? Chris Swift : Elyse, you're focused on forward guidance, and we've obviously talked about what we think we could do. But I would just share with you, yes, we feel good with the overall performance of all our businesses really through the first 9 months. And that's why I sort of called that out. Investment results have been very favorable across our portfolios, particularly with the strong LP contributions, but rates are rising. So we still like our long-term view of 6 to 7 on sort of a normalized basis if you're going to look at it that way. But we'll always continue to try to outperform and exceed expectations. But I still would have you anchor in that 6% to 7% range. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David, your line is now open. David Motemaden : Chris and Doug, you both mentioned that you have approximately 100 basis points of spread between renewal written pricing and loss trends, if we exclude workers' comp. Just wondering what that is if we include workers' comp given how big that is within the Commercial Lines business. Chris Swift : I'll just reinforce what Beth said, David, is that going into the year, our pricing plan compared to what we thought loss trend was, was going to have a modest negative effect, probably to 0.5 point on sort of combined ratios. I think through the first 9 months, we're outperforming that 0.5 point negative pressure. But that's the way I would frame it. And Doug, I don't know if you would add anything else. But I'd like to just have you think of -- comps in its own different sort of spear as far as historical performance, the regulatory oversight in that line, David, and that's why we just talk about an ex comp spread. Doug Elliot : David, I would just add that even inclusive of comp, our total commercial spread is still about the same. So the calculus is plus or minus 100 points. And yes, to Chris' point, comp continues to perform for us across our markets. David Motemaden : And then also follow-up for Beth. Beth, you had said that there were some true-ups in the third quarter of 2021 related to favorable frequency and rate coming in a bit better than you had anticipated. I was wondering if you could just size the favorable impact that, that had on the third quarter of 2021 in Commercial Lines? Beth Costello : Yes. So I guess the way I would characterize it is that when you look at the delta between last third quarter and this third quarter for Small Commercial, that delta and workers' comp was probably a bit over 1 point. And again, that really is coming from the favorability we saw last third quarter. And as I said, we were sort of anticipating when we set our loss picks for the year that we see, like I said, about 0.5 point deterioration. So I think that helps size a little bit of just kind of the delta and what we're seeing. Chris Swift : And the remainder then would be property. Beth Costello : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian, your line is open. Brian Meredith : A couple of questions here for you. First, I want to drill in a little bit on the Middle and Large Commercial Lines underlying combined ratios here. If we take a look at year-to-date, they're flat in the last couple of quarters has been up year-over-year. Just curious what's kind of surprised you relative to what you were kind of expecting coming into 2022? And what are you doing potentially to address some of those surprises you're seeing in that market or that line? Doug Elliot : Brian, this is Doug. The only real aberration through either 9 months and also in the quarter is our non-CAT, non-weather property volatility. So I look at the rest of the lines, I look at our performance, essentially right on target. So that little volatility in the quarter is the only thing we're looking at year-to-date against our expectations. Brian Meredith : Would inflation may be a little bit higher than you expected on some of the property stuff, is that potentially it? Doug Elliot : I mean there's a little inflation as -- we've talked about inflation, but our pricing has been at or right on expectations as well. So I think we're matching what we're seeing on the economic loss trend side with our performance on the pricing end. So I feel good about that. Brian Meredith : And then within your Global Specialty business, I'm just curious, do you all have the capacity or the, call it, the desire to potentially take advantage of what could be a much better pricing environment for CAT-exposed property business. And what's your appetite for that? Doug Elliot : I don't think you're going to see us in the next 6 months, become a major CAT writer, right? We don't have that as an ambition. But our growing ambition over the past decade has been to be a stronger, more thoughtful, deeper, bigger property writer, and that goal remains and we're doing it selectively. So in our Middle and Large Commercial business, we've got a large property segment. We've got a growing property book in our core middle book. And then we also have a really neat specialty business -- property business in our Global Specialty. So I look at property across the franchise. And I think that on the optimistic side, you will see that grow over time, but I don't think we're going to step right in and try to take advantage of a timing moment right now with CAT property. Chris Swift : Brian, that's been one of our strategic themes, it's Doug, and I've talked about for years is just to have a broader property skill set in all our business segments, whether it be Small, Middle, Large, E&S and Specialty. And then the only color I would add on our reinsurance operations is it's a global property and casualty focused reinsurer that has some specialty orientation also to it, writes about $500 million of total premiums. Doug, I would say its profitability and execution has been outstanding in the last couple of years. It did obviously suffer some Ian impacts this quarter that we called out. But generally, it's a nice specialty orientation in that Global Specialty area. Doug Elliot : Yes. Very disciplined, very thoughtful and maybe some selective opportunity here that in Global Re, Brian, they will take advantage of. I was more referring to the primary space, but it's been a strong complement to our property capabilities and our thought process. So I think it will be opportunistic. We'll be thoughtful about what we do relative to CAT peril. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Greg Peters : I guess for my first question, I'll focus in on the expense ratio. And obviously, there's a broader expense ratio across the entire enterprise. But I was looking at the Commercial Lines expense ratio, I think it's on Slide 7. And for -- it was 31.5 versus 31.8 a year ago. And I know you've been working on initiatives to improve it. So I guess with the growth that we're seeing, I guess I'm kind of surprised we're not getting a little bit more improvement. So maybe you can unpack what's going on with the expense ratio and where the improvements are coming from? And the good guys and bad guys, I guess, in the expense ratio. Chris Swift : Brian, let me leave context and then Doug and Beth can add their capabilities. As Beth said in our prepared remarks, and you can see in our deck, I'm really pleased with the execution of our Hartford next program over a multiyear. That program and the savings that it generated is allowing us to think differently about investing going forward. And we've maintained sort of our view that we still want to build the organization in certain capabilities areas, whether it be digital, whether it be APIs. So we still are investing in the organization at a healthy, healthy clip. That is sort of muting the underlying efficiencies that we're gaining. I would call out the investments we're going to continue to make sort of in our cloud journey as a big initiative over a multiyear period of time. We got the large initiatives in Global Specialty over the next couple of years from a data science side. And then lastly, from a Group Benefit side, we are going to develop a new administration system with an outside service provider to modernize that 40-year-old tech stack. So I think you know we're builders, we're growers and that's part of why you're seeing maybe less benefit on the expense ratios as you sit here today. But Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes. I would agree with those comments, I think specifically as it relates to third quarter I believe in the third quarter of last year, we had a little bit of a release in bad debt. So that made last year's number maybe 30 basis points better. So that obviously affects that compare a little bit. And then also, we also look at our commission ratio has ticked up just a small amount as well, which, again, some of that reflective of just the strong profitability in the book and how that comes through in some of the supplemental comps. So those, I think, help to explain why maybe you wouldn't see more of a benefit just quarter-over-quarter. Greg Peters : I'm going to pivot, and I know you spent time talking about this in your prepared remarks, but on the Personal Line side, you look at the rate increase trend, it's all moving up. I recall travelers comments on their call where they were talking about mid-teens type of rate increases for their book of business next year. And I know you have a specialty auto book, but maybe you could spend a little bit more time just telling us how you see the rate trend moving over the next several quarters in the context of all the inflationary pressures we're reading about? Doug Elliot : Sure, Greg. So maybe I'll build on what I shared in my script. Again, fourth quarter, as I said, we expect that change of five to move our rates move up into the 10 category and then move into mid-teens. Our expectations in the second half of the year that our phys dam loss trend would abate a bit did not come to pass. So the world we see today and the trends we're experiencing at this moment, we're expecting those to continue into 2023, which are driving our assumptions inside our rate plan activity. We described the first half of '23, an active rate process for us. And I think mid-teens will allow us to get on top of those trends. And I expect as we move through the first quarter into the second quarter, we'll be at very adequate terms for our book of business. Keeping in mind that as we introduce prevail into the marketplace, which is a 6-month policy, we still have lots of policies out there that are 12 months in our old Hartford auto and home product is a 12-month product. So there is a mix that will head towards 6 month the quicker we work our way through Prevail. But at the moment, we still have a lot of 12-month policies there. Chris Swift : Greg, it's Chris. You characterized your question as a specialty auto carrier. I would push back on that. I mean we consider it a preferred segment through our AARP relationship over 30-plus years. So maybe you're just -- you've confused the thoughts in your head, but it's not a specialty-orientated auto book. It is a preferred class of customers, at least in my mind. Greg Peters : Wrong -- poor word choice, but on congratulations on your retirement, Doug. Doug Elliot : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Reading through the press release, you talked about a decrease in new specialty business. Could you share a little color on what lines you were pulling back on and perhaps what lines you were seeing some strength in new business growth? Doug Elliot : Andrew, our comments relate to competition in the specialty space primarily in the Professional Lines area. So our lines area has -- as I commented, seen depressed pricing. In fact, our pricing went negative in the second quarter -- I'm sorry, the third quarter for D&O. But it's an area that has gone through significant profit opportunity. And now as the lines are very adequate for us and probably many others in the industry, a lot of competition has gathered. So we see that competition. We are not going to chase for pricing. We're going to keep our discipline. And I attribute the lack of growth compared to prior periods in that Global Specialty space really to competition and us keeping our discipline, which we intend to maintain as we move into 2023. Andrew Kligerman : So could you see a further decline in sales in new business? Doug Elliot : So hard to predict, and we always give you our best view of the future when we talk to you on the fourth quarter call. But I think the fourth quarter probably will not be a lot different in behavior than what we saw in the third quarter. It's a little early to talk about '23, I think, at the moment. Chris Swift : Hopeful, Andrew, maybe there's a little more rationality that comes back into the market in '23, but time will tell. Andrew Kligerman : And then shifting back to Personal Lines. It was interesting to me that you cited auto physical damage as a real pressure on the loss ratio. But no mention of the medical cost inflation and I think all state had highlighted some pretty severe movements in their reserving for medical on the auto line. So any thoughts on where medical is trending? Beth Costello : Yes. So included in our loss picks in auto, a component of that is medical. We have seen some uptick and that's reflected in our estimates and has been and we haven't called that out because it hasn't been a significant driver of the changes that we were anticipating for the year, which has really been on the physical damage side because as you recall, we had anticipated to see some relief and inflationary pressures in the second half that have not obviously materialized. Andrew Kligerman : And maybe if I could just sneak one quick one in there. You wrote some new business, as you cited in the release and the personal auto area. Are you given the rate increases that you need, are you comfortable with that new business that you're putting on the books? Or could that be a little weak in year one? Doug Elliot : Andrew, good question. We are spending a lot of time on the quality of the new business we're writing in Personal Lines. And I think our team to date still feels very solid about the quality, but we are moving on the pricing side, and we'll continue to move. And it's one of the reasons that we have slowed the prevail rollout. Still moving forward, but slow slightly to make sure that our rate adequacies as we introduce the new product into market are where they need to be, given our view of current trends. And as you know, and as we've discussed, that trend has been moving on us throughout the year. So yes, I'm very confident about where we are today and know that quality is something we've got in our front viewfinder day in, day out. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is now open. Michael Phillips : I guess I want to continue with auto for a second. I scratched my head with some auto results of some companies, and I got to put yours in that category. I'm a little confused on something. And then if I look at your auto core results, you've been north of 100% even in the back half of last year. Your pricing back then was low single digit, it's now 5. It's going to get better, that's good. It's going to get better. But I guess what I don't get is, you're averaging north of 100% last year. The question might be just kind of when did you start seeing -- maybe you saw it differently. When did you start seeing the high physical damage, maybe you saw it a little bit later. But despite north of 100% and low single-digit pricing even back then, today, you're taking favorable development. So I'm confused on that and how long that might last. Doug Elliot : Yes, Michael, we started seeing adverse phys dam pressure to our book and our expectations by late -- mid-to-late summer last year. So our filings ramped up in the September time frame, and they have continued to ramp throughout the year. Many of these states are now in the double-dip stage. So we're taking two bites at that apple inside the year. And our expectation for '22 was that we would see some of those physical damage trends contain themselves a bit in the back half of the year, which we have not seen over the third quarter. So as we project forward, our activities will deal with the climate we see today. And as such, our fourth quarter pricing activities are going to be in the 10% range. That is reflective of where we think those rates need to be filed at. And as we continue to '23, as I said, it will go north from there. Beth Costello : And then the only thing I add is you did mention the favorable prior year development that we saw in the auto line, that was primarily related to 2018 and prior. Just to put context on where we were seeing that benefit. Michael Phillips : So it was prior to 2021. But I -- is concerned maybe the numbers you were putting up in the back half of last year had some padding for it, despite the fact that as you just said, you even start to see the higher trends last year. But you must have put some in for 2021 accident year. Beth Costello : Yes, we had increased our views on physical damage in the second half of '21. And again, our expectation was that those were going to start to level off and we start to see some improvement in the back half of this year, which obviously we've not seen, and we've been responding accordingly each quarter as we book the current quarter activity. Doug Elliot : And Michael, I think it goes without saying, but obviously, that activity quarter-by-quarter now is rolling into our filings. So what we experienced in the fourth quarter became a big part of the first and second quarter filings in the first quarter. So as we think about the experience, we have tried to reflect it in our loss pick calls, but also in our filings as we move ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Josh, your line is now open. Josh Shanker : Looking at the healthy increase in the dividend, I'm just trying to understand the idea about a permanent 10% increase in the dividend versus extra gun powder for share repurchase for the lower increase in the dividend. How are you balancing those two things? Beth Costello : Yes. Well, I think we've been consistently balancing those things. We do think that it's important for us to maintain a competitive dividend. And I think the dividend really, in my mind, speaks to just the ongoing earnings power as we see of the organization. And as I said, we've been kind of a path of increasing that each year as our earnings continue to increase. I think we've got a very healthy repurchase authorization that allows us to execute on deploying our excess capital. So I feel very good about the balance that we create in both of those items. Josh Shanker : And then I didn't catch it in the prepared remarks, maybe I missed it, but did you give us a gross loss for Ian so we compare it to the net loss, how much of reinsurance picked up? Beth Costello : I did not, but I would say that from a reinsurance perspective, it's like $15 million to $16 million of recoverable that we booked within those estimates for Ian loss. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Yaron, your line is now open. Yaron Kinar : Congratulations to Doug on the retirement. I guess first question, just with your plan of really keeping the reinsurance structure unchanged next year. And I realize nothing's really set in stone yet, but assuming you're able to do that and with reinsurance costs probably going up, and I think you guys are mostly mid markets, so maybe you see the ability to offset that through price lag a little bit. I guess all this said, is it reasonable to think that all else equal, margins could see a little bit of a, a little bit of pressure, at least in the early half of next year? Doug Elliot : I think that's a little bit big step to take right now. Our property pricing moved up in Middle/Large Commercial toward the end of the third quarter. Our underwriters across the franchise on property know they've got to look hard at insured value numbers on all of our accounts. I think they're understanding and looking back at their CAT models given what happened over the last 30 days. So we're moving on the primary side. And our experience certainly from a CAT perspective, reinsurance has been generally very, very solid over the last decade. So it is too early to tell, but I'm not thinking about property compression right now. I'm thinking about it in terms of making sure we get needed rate on our book of business across every line that is writing the property. Chris Swift : Hi, I think you said it well. To me, Yaron, we'll always think about economics and what does it mean and sort of that risk return trade-off. But as Doug said, our historical performance, our deep partnerships with our reinsurers and the fact that we do have multiyear rate guarantees on different layers. I think immunizes is a little bit from any pressure on rates that we might face. So time will tell, and we'll report back to you early next year. Yaron Kinar : And then on the D&O competitive pressure commentary, can you maybe add a little more color on where this pressure is coming in more? Is it more in the primary layers? Is it more access? Are you seeing it more from new entrants or incumbents? Doug Elliot : Well, I would share. Our book is approximately 80% excess in the U.S. D&O space. So I can comment on what we're seeing there, which is where the pressure we're seeing -- we're also seeing it on the primary side, but our book is primarily excess. So I'd start with that. There have been a series of new entrants over the past 24 months. As we all have talked about, the IPO market has slowed and the SPAC market has slowed as well. So the new, new opportunities in the marketplace are not where they were one and two years ago. So lack of upside opportunity and very solid, strong rate adequacies has led to quite a bit of competition, which I think is fueling inside this book and on us, it's hitting primarily in our excess area. Yaron Kinar : I understand that you're mostly excess, but ultimately, if the primary layer is coming in at a lower price, it also reflects on the excess price, I think. So I guess, is more of the pressure coming from the primary layer coming in? Or is it more from the excess layer pricing diminishing? Doug Elliot : I think there's pricing pressure up the tower. There is some pressure in the primary, but I'm really speaking to primarily excess where we've seen quite a bit of new capacity come in. Easier to come in, in the excess area, and that's what we're experiencing that pressure today. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ward of Citi. Michael, your line is now open. Michael Ward : I was just wondering, you cited volume-related staffing costs for commercial. Just curious, is that related to workers' comp claims? Or I guess, what does that pertain to? I think we had heard about this in group in the past, but not necessarily for P&C. Beth Costello : Yes. I would call that more on the production side, not on the claims side. So again, as you can see from our very healthy top line from a dollars perspective, we also just see some more costs relative to that production, just which reflects that volume, but not claims related. Michael Ward : Okay. The rest of my questions were asked. Operator : Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jimmy, your line is now open. Jimmy Bhullar : So first, I just had a question on the development in the Commercial side. I think you mentioned adverse development in commercial auto. If you could just go into detail on what years are related to and what the driver was? Beth Costello : Yes. So in Commercial Lines, auto really relates to accident years 2017 to 2019. And specifically, we had one claim that had an adverse verdict during the quarter that we reacted to. Jimmy Bhullar : And then on personal auto, obviously, you're raising prices, it will take a while to flow through your results given your 12-month policies. Do you have any views on states that are not allowing price hikes right now like California and whether the companies are making some sort of headway in convincing regulators to approve price hikes? Chris Swift : Yes, Jimmy, I'm not going to comment on the regulatory environment because it's pretty dynamic in various parts of the country, and you mentioned one particular state. So we pride ourselves on working with all our regulators in a constructive fashion and hopefully, that can continue in some of these problematic areas. Operator : This concludes the Q&A for today. I will hand back to Susan Spivak for any further remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Chris Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Today, I will start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results and accomplishments. Then I will turn the call over to Beth to dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics, after which I will close our prepared remarks with a review of expectations for 2023. We will then be joined by our business leaders as we move into Q&A. So, let's get started. The Hartford is pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter, capping an outstanding year of financial performance in progress against our strategic objectives. Quarter-after-quarter, we are delivering strong financial results demonstrating the power of the franchise and the depth of our distribution relationships. Our commitment to superior customer experience, the benefits of significant investments made over the last few years, and superb execution by our 19,000 employees drive our success. These competitive advantages helped us deliver exceptional results in 2022, including core earnings growth of 14% with core EPS growth of 23%, top line growth in commercial lines of 11% with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 6% with a core earnings margin of 6.5%. Strong investment results with excellent limited partnership returns and increasing fixed income portfolio yields, and core earnings ROE of 14.4%, while returning 2.1 billion of excess capital to shareholders. Looking forward, with strong momentum across all lines, I am confident we can continue to deliver superior results. Now, let me share a few highlights from each of our businesses. In commercial lines, written premium growth for the year was driven by strong exposure growth, pricing increases, higher policy retention, and continued strong new business. Underlying margins improved by nearly a point driven by earned pricing, exceeding loss cost trends across most lines in growing expense leverage driven in large part by our Hartford Next program. Across commercial lines, our brand, depth of distribution and enhanced underwriting capabilities combined with excellent customer experience, have positioned us well to capture market share, while maintaining or improving already strong margins. Small commercial results continued to be exceptional, consistently producing sub-90 underlying combined ratios with industry leading products and digital capabilities, all of which drove record breaking written premium in new business levels in 2022. Going forward, small commercial will remain a growth engine for The Hartford. For example, beyond our traditional product lines, we will continue to expand our addressable market with capabilities in the excess and surplus binding lines. This portion of the E&S business is in about an $8 billion market serving small business owners, property, and liability exposures. With current written premiums exceeding the $100 million, and the evolving innovative capabilities within our broker quoting platform, we expect to become a leading destination for E&S binding opportunities and a strong complement to our existing admitted retail offering. In middle and large commercial, our team has done a tremendous job improving underlying margins by approximately 7 points since 2019 with a written premium compounded growth rate of 6% over the same period. In 2022, written premiums grew 10% for the year with improved quality retention and solid new business. Advancements in data science capabilities industry leading pricing segmentation analytics and exceptional talent had delivered healthy margin, which I believe positions us well to continue driving profitable growth in this business. In Global Specialty, I'm extremely pleased with the team's accomplishments since the strategic acquisition in 2019. Their tireless efforts have enabled us to meaningfully increase the size and scale of our specialty business to 3.6 billion of gross written premium, including over 800 million E&S premium. We are leveraging the global specialty franchise to further grow and expand our capabilities across commercial lines in this [$82 billion] [ph] E&S market. Global Specialty results in 2022 were outstanding with an underlying margin of 84.6 improving over 4 points from prior year and over 11 points from 2019, demonstrating our execution financity, enhanced underwriting tools, and the expertise of the team. Our competitive position, breadth of products, and solid renewal written pricing, drove a 9% increase in gross written premiums for the year, including 41% in our global reinsurance business, 19% in Ocean Marine, and 27% in international casualty. Turning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal written price increases for the quarter were 4.9%, flat compared to the third quarter. Underneath, U.S. Standard commercial lines renewal written pricing, excluding workers' compensation accelerated from the third quarter to 7.9%, up 1 point primarily driven by auto and property lines. Workers' compensation pricing remained positive benefiting from average wage growth. Within Global Specialty, excluding public company D&O renewal written pricing remained stable in the mid-single-digits and in aggregate in-line with loss cost trends. Wholesale property, auto, primary casualty, all saw higher pricing increases over the third quarter as did U.S. and international marine. Additionally, the public D&O market continues to be competitive with rate pressures, which requires new business discipline and a focus on retaining profitable current accounts. Moving to personal lines, pricing is accelerated across auto and home, resulting in written premium growth of 4% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full-year. Like others in the industry, auto underlying combined ratios remain elevated as we continue to experience inflationary pressure. We have been actively responding with rate filings throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, filed auto rates averaged 8.3% increase, up 3.4 points from the third quarter. In Homeowners, we have kept pace with loss cost trends through net rate and insured value increases reflected in renewal written pricing of 10.7% for the year and 13.3% for the fourth quarter. Turning to Group Benefits, the core earnings margin of 8.3% for the quarter and 6.5% for the full-year represents significant increases from last year as excess mortality has materially declined. Meanwhile, long-term disability trends are stable and within our expectations for incident rates and recoveries. Fully insured sales for 2022 were 801 million, up 5% and employer group persistency was approximately 92%, a strong result for the year. First quarter is off to an excellent start with persistency modestly higher and outstanding new sales results. We expect the Group Benefits marketplace to remain dynamic as digital transformation, product innovation, and customer demand accelerate. As a result, we are making significant investments today and have a clear roadmap for the future that I am confident will only strengthen our market leadership position going forward. Now, I will turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were 746 million or $2.31 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.4%. In commercial lines, core earnings were 562 million. Written premium was up 9%, reflecting written pricing increases and exposure growth along with an 18% increase in new business in small commercial and 6% in middle market. Policy account retention also increased in small and middle market. The underlying combined ratio of 87.4 improved from the prior year fourth quarter with both a lower loss ratio and expense ratio. Small commercial continues to deliver superior operating results with an underlying combined ratio of 87.5 and middle and large commercial delivered a solid 90.2. Global Specialty's underlying margin improved 5.8 points from a year ago to an outstanding 83 as it benefited from strong earned pricing increases. In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter were 42 million. The underlying combined ratio was 96.2, reflecting continued auto liability and physical damage severity pressure driven by elevated repair costs, as well as increased bodily injury trends and includes 2 points of losses related to prior quarters in 2022. Written premium grew 4% for the quarter, largely reflecting pricing increases in both auto and home. In home, overall loss results were in-line with our expectations. Non cat weather frequency continues to run favorable to long-term averages and together with the effect of earned pricing increases mitigates material and labor costs, which remain at historically high levels. The expense ratio decrease of 3.5 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spend.  Current accident year cat losses in the quarter were 135 million, which includes the benefit of a 68 million reduction in estimates from catastrophes that occurred during the first three quarters of 2022, including 31 million related to Hurricane Ian. Winter Storm Elliott losses were 167 million net of reinsurance, of which 150 million was in commercial lines. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was 46 million, primarily related to reserve reductions in worker compensation, catastrophes, and bond, partially offset by reserve increases in general liability and commercial auto. We completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 229 million increase in reserves comprised of 162 million for asbestos and 67 million for environmental. All of the 229 million was ceded to the adverse development cover, leaving 256 million of limit remaining. The increase in asbestos reserves was primarily due to an increase in the cost of resolving asbestos filings and a modest increase in the company's share of loss on a few specific individual accounts. The increase in environmental reserves was mainly due to an increase in the estimates for PFAS exposures, one large account settlement and higher estimated site remediation costs. Before turning to Group Benefits, I would like to review the January 1 reinsurance renewals. Overall, we are very pleased with the placements and terms and conditions for our program against the backdrop of a challenging renewal season. Our [indiscernible] current and aggregate property catastrophe protection were renewed at an approximate 20% increase in cost and 28% on a risk adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information, compared favorably with overall market increases and speaks to the quality of our book of business and favorable experience. Overall, the structure of our property cat program did not change significantly. We increased the attachment point on the 200 million aggregate cover to 750 million, up from 700 million. There were also some changes in the treaty that provides coverage for certain loss events under 350 million. We have summarized these changes in the slide deck. In addition to our property catastrophe program, we also successfully renewed several other reinsurance treaties, which also experienced rate increases with limited changes in terms and conditions. The rates we charge insured already have been incorporating these higher costs and therefore we do not expect any significant adverse combined ratio impact from these renewals. Turning to Group Benefits, core earnings in the fourth quarter of 141 million and the 8.3% core earnings margins reflect a lower level of excess mortality losses and growth in fully insured premiums. The disability loss ratio improved 6.1 points from the prior year quarter, which had elevated estimated long-term disability incidence trends. In addition, COVID-19 related short-term disability losses were lower this quarter. All cause excess mortality was 43 million before tax, compared to 161 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The group life loss ratio, excluding excess mortality increased 4.7 points, primarily due to higher accidental death losses as compared to very favorable experience in the fourth quarter of 2021. Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings were 390 million, reflecting lower daily average AUM, primarily due to equity market declines and higher interest rates over the past 12 months. And lastly, investment results were strong in the quarter with net investment income of 640 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from the higher interest straight environments. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships was 3.7% before tax, a 40 basis point increase in the third quarter. We anticipate our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership returns will increase by approximately 50 basis points to 60 basis points in 2023, compared to the full-year 2022 before tax yield of 3.2%. Our partnership returns of 16.8% in the fourth quarter and 14.4% for full-year 2022 were exceptional. Performance was primarily driven by income from opportunistic sales within our commercial real estate JV equity portfolio, which generated annualized returns of 31% in the fourth quarter. Our private equity holdings were also resilient, delivering a 7% annualized return in the quarter. For the full-year, real estate generated a 22% return and private equity generated a 14% return. As we enter 2023, we expect continued volatility in markets. Given outlook for a slowdown in consumer consumption, corporate investment and M&A activity, we expect our private equity returns to be below our long-term target. At the same time, the increase in financing costs and the reduced availability of real estate financing is expected to impact sales activity in our real estate JV equity. With this backdrop, we expect a 4% to 6% return for partnership and other alternative investments in 2023.  Turning to capital, as of December 31, holding company resources totaled 1 billion. For 2023, we expect dividends from the operating companies of 1.5 billion from P&C, 400 million from Group Benefits, and 125 million from Hartford Funds. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares for $350 million. As of the end of the year, we have 2.75 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. To wrap up, our businesses performed strongly in 2022 and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns and enhance value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn it back to Chris. Chris Swift : Thank you, Beth. Let's [take it forward] [ph] where I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2023. Underpinning the outlook is our commitment to disciplined underwriting and expanding or maintaining margins, while prudently growing our book of business. In 2023, we are expecting a commercial lines underlying combined ratio in the range of 87% to 89%. Total renewal written price increases in commercial lines, excluding workers' compensation are expected to be fairly stable, compared with 2022. Meaningful increases in standard commercial property, auto, and general liability pricing are somewhat offset with competitive pricing headwinds in parts of our financial lines business. In our global reinsurance book, we expect meaningful written price increases, including over 30% for U.S. and European property coverage. Commercial loss cost trends are expected to remain fairly stable with some moderation in property severity as inflation is expected to ease during the second half of the year. Before I get into specific trends for our market leading workers\u2019 compensation business, let me remind you of its current margin strength and stellar contribution to our overall commercial line results. Looking back over the last 25 years, our loss ratio results have outperformed the industry on average by approximately 5 points, reflecting our significant competitive advantages in pricing sophistication, underwriting analytics, [and claim] [ph] management. In addition, our scale and wealth of data allow us to anticipate, identify, and quickly react to emerging trends as we manage retention and growth in this line. Over the past 10 years, our standard commercial lines workers' compensation book that's produced combined ratios averaging near 90, while our premier small commercial book has performed even better with an average combined ratios in the mid-80. Also impressive, is a 6 point underlying loss ratio improvement since 2019 in middle market accomplished by equipping our underwriters with advanced risk segmentation tools. We expect workers' compensation to remain a highly profitable business and an important earnings contributor to The Hartford. Turning to a few specifics in our forecast. Workers' compensation renewal written pricing, which is comprised of net rate and average wage growth is projected to be flat to slightly negative. Loss costs are expected to be up slightly as long-term frequency and severity selections remain unchanged from 2022. We will continue to use our market leading tools in underwriting expertise in risk selection and book management to minimize any margin compression. In 2023, we expect workers' compensation returns to remain attractive with deterioration equating to roughly 0.5 point on the commercial lines underlying combined ratio. In summary, for commercial lines, we are extremely confident in our ability to manage our book through a variety of economic and market environment, an underlying combined ratio within a range of 87 to 89 will be an outstanding result and reflects our ability to execute consistently and deliver superior margins. Turning to Personal Lines, we expect a 2023 underlying combined ratio in the range of 93 to 95. In auto, renewal written price is expected to accelerate into the mid-teens by the second quarter and remain there for the balance of the year. By mid-year, we expect new business to be price adequate. Loss cost trends, primarily driven by severity, are expected to remain elevated during the first half of the year before returning to more normal level in the second half. In Homeowners, we expect earned pricing to generally keep pace with loss cost trends throughout 2023. As we navigate this inflationary period across Personal Lines, we are focused on balancing re-adequacy, quality of new business, and marketing productivity. Overall, I am confident we have the right execution plans to return this business to targeted profitability in 2024. In Group Benefits, we expect the 2023 core earnings margin to be between 6% and 7% consistent with our long-term margin outlook for this business. With COVID shifting from pandemic, to endemic state, excess mortality losses are expected to improve versus 2022.  However, we expect mortality trends will settle above pre-pandemic levels and we are pricing business accordingly. [All-in] [ph], group life loss ratios are expected to improve versus 2022 and in group disability, we expect some moderation of recent favorable incidents and recovery trends. Before closing, I'd like to share a few recent ESG achievements. This year, The Hartford will be honored as one of two global catalyst award winners for advances we have made in diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Catalyst Award is the premier recognition of organizational DE&I efforts, driving representation, and inclusion for women.  The Hartford was also named to The Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index into America's most just companies list for 2023 having earned both honors every year since their inception. The recognition we continue to receive is a testament to our long standing commitment to sustainability and the dedication and hard work of our teams. In closing, let me summarize why I'm so bullish about the future for our shareholders. One, our 2022 financial results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the benefits of continued investments in our businesses, resulting in strong growth in margins in commercial line, group benefits operating at targeted returns, and a personal lines business tracking back to target margins. Two, we have the capability to sustain superior returns as a result of our performance driven culture, outstanding underwriting, and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer centric technology. Three, investment income is increasing supported by a diversified portfolio of assets and credit quality remains healthy. And finally, we are proactively managing our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford. Our franchise has never been better positioned to deliver industry leading financial performance with a core earnings ROE range of 14% to 15%, while creating value for all our stakeholders. Let me now turn the call over to Susan for Q&A. Susan Spivak : Thank you. Operator, we have about 30 minutes for questions. Could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions here. First one, just curious if I look Hartford Next, it looks like you got another 65 million to recognize an expense saves coming through in 2023. It gets to about 0.5 point on the expense ratio. Are there some offsets we should think about in 2023 that will maybe make it so we don't see that half a point? Chris Swift : Brian, thanks for the question. Thanks for joining. You are right. I mean the Hartford Next program is contributing to our overall efficiency and effectiveness and it does have about a half a point benefit in \u2013 as we head into 2023. The second part of your question is, do you see any challenges to executing on that as we sit here today? No. I mean, I think that's a good assumption, if I understood your question correctly. Brian Meredith : Yes, yes. Exactly. That's it. So, I mean the 0.5 points should be beneficial. Okay, good. And then Chris, I'm just curious. Obviously, a really strong property market right now from a pricing perspective. It sounds like you took advantage of some of the property pricing in the reinsurance marketplace. I'm just curious, could you maybe talk a little bit about your capabilities, capacity, willingness to kind of lean into the property markets right now and see some good growth in that business? And perhaps margin accretive for your 2022 results? Chris Swift : I think Brian you picked up on one of our key strategic initiatives over really the last five years to be a bigger property writer. Maybe it's not known by you, sort of firsthand, but we have about $3 billion of property premium, including homeowners premium of about 1 billion. So, it is an area of focus. It's an area of growth for us. We do operate on the small end with a [bi-product] [ph] in middle and large, and we also have developed an E&S property capability. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have some assumed reinsurance property exposures around the world. So, it is on a primary basis an area we're leaning into. That will ultimately help continue to diversify our book of business so that we're a more balanced organization going forward. So, yes, it is a focus of ours going forward. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. If I could just squeeze one more in. Group Benefits, are you seeing any impact yet from some of the layoffs that we're seeing at large corporations? Chris Swift : I would share with you and then I\u2019ll ask Jonathan Bennett to comment. Generally, no. I mean, we have a book of business that range from obviously large global organizations to small and middle size organizations, but the trends in our book are fairly stable, Jonathan. What would you add? Jonathan Bennett : I definitely agree with what you said, Chris. Point out in the fourth quarter, we had growth of earned premium and fees of about a little over 8%, so strong fourth quarter. And as you pointed out in your comments, we're off to a great start in January with good new sales and strong persistency. So, we're on the watch. We are aware of all the announcements happening as well. But where we sit today, we're in pretty good shape and looking forward to 2023. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ward of Citi. Mike, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Ward : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I had a question on workers' comp. I'm just curious what you're assuming around underlying losses and how big might you say the headwind is to the year-over-year underlying combined ratio? Chris Swift : Yes, thank you for the question. Michael. I alluded to some of this in my prepared remarks, so I will try to connect the dots maybe a little bit better. But as we define, sort of renewal pricing combination of pure net rate and then exposure growth with additional workers, I mean that's likely to be flat at best to slightly negative. And if you overlay, sort of our consistent long-term medical cost inflation of five points and a frequency assumption that is generally consistent with our longer-term trends, I mean that will have a negative impact on our combined ratio. And I sized it about a half a point in relation to our overall commercial lines, new combined ratio. I think the other hand, though, you've got to connect the dots, again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are getting good net rate in auto property, particularly and the expense efficiencies that more than offsets that half a point of decline. And really at the point, if I really measure it more precisely, we see 0.5 point of commercial lines improvement year-over-year. Mike Ward : Okay, great. And thank you. Maybe on the cat loss guidance, curious how are you able to keep it relatively similar to last year? Just thinking about inflation and modestly higher retentions under the reinsurance treaties? Chris Swift : Yes, I would \u2013 again, good question. I think the gist of it as Beth said in her prepared remarks. Our reinsurance treaties have not changed dramatically from a risk side. We're very pleased with the overall renewal. And that's consistent, sort of with our modeling and expectation, particularly given the exposures that we enjoy today. So, would you add any other color, Beth? Beth Costello : Yes. The only other thing I would add, I mean, it is up just a tenth of a point, if you look at what our guidance was last year. And as a reminder, we've been talking about we've been taking rate in the property book. So that obviously is there to mitigate some of the cost pressures that you referred to. And then again, as Chris commented on, our structure of our cat program not changed significantly. Mike Ward : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Greg, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Greg Peters : Great. Good morning, everyone. For the first question, I would like to focus on the retention stats that you put in your supplement both for commercial and personal lines. In listening to the comments of others, it seems like the trends of retention might be moving up in commercial and down in personal. Yet when I look at your numbers, it looks pretty stable. Can you talk to us both in commercial and personal about what you're seeing on policy retention and how that factors into your outlook for next year or this year, I should say? Chris Swift : Sure, Greg. And then I might ask Stephanie and Mo to add their color in their respective businesses. I would say at the outset it's, sort of been our priority to really take care of our book of business, principally because we work so hard to improve it, so hard to acquire the right new customers. And I mean, you see the margins and the returns that we're generating.  So, the number one priority we have going into the year is, taking care of customers, trying to do everything you can to prevent a piece of business going out to bid and creating a shopper opportunity. And that's good to retain. It's obviously not so good when you're looking to see if there's new business opportunities. But generally, it's the most profitable strategy to just take care of your existing customers with the necessary rate increases that keeps pace with loss cost trends. So, Stephanie, what would you say in small and personal lines? Stephanie Bush : Sure. Good morning. So, in small commercial, what I would share is that it is very strong and stable, which I really believe is a testament to our entire business model. And I've shared these comments before in other forums. Everything that we do across the entire business model really lives into three key principles. Being easy to do business with, being accurate when we provide that pricing and that overall experience and then being consistent, particularly when you come from a renewal perspective. We have been consistently, particularly in the BOP and the auto lines been taking rate, measured rate over an extended period of time. And so, we continue to build confidence with our agents and our small business owner. So, I would expect that you would still continue to see healthy and strong retention in small commercial. When I go over to the personal lines space and I'll start with auto, you know, as we all know, the market is \u2013 there's a bit of disruption going on. And as you can see in our results, we've been very stable. We have been taking rate for 12 quarters straight and will continue to take rate. And so, it gives us confidence in terms of our overall offering. We're continuing to step up the rate changes that Chris and Beth referenced in their prepared comments. But overall, I would expect personal lines to be somewhat stable potentially a very modest decline in auto this year in 2023, but overall stable. Chris Swift : Mo, what would you add? Mo Tooker : Yes. I\u2019d echo many of Stephanie's small commercial [teams] [ph]. I think we feel really good about both the middle and large commercial and the global specialty books in terms of the quality of what we have. And as such, the retention will play an important role in our strategies. We are watching closely as Chris has talked about. We're watching closely the workers' comp and the public E&O. We feel really good about the quality of those books, but there's a little bit more pressure there. So, I think retention and rate is a little bit more tactical there. But again, we feel great about the quality of both books and we'll protect them. Greg Peters : Thanks for that detail. Just as a follow-up and I know you addressed it in your opening comments and Stephanie just mentioned it again, but and I'm looking at your guidance for personal lines for 2023 of 100.5 to 102.5. And then I'm looking at what happened in auto, particularly in the combined ratio really spiking up in the fourth quarter. I know there's rate coming, is it your sense that we're, sort of beginning to approach, sort of like the peak or trough profitability for auto in the next couple of quarters or do you expect it to remain at these elevated levels as we see in the fourth quarter? Mo Tooker : Yes. What I would say, Greg, is that at least the first half of the year, I think you're going to see an elevation, maybe a modest decline from where we are today. Remember, we have about [indiscernible] five points of seasonality and sort of the auto results this quarter. So \u2013 but if you leave a look at the full-year, auto results of 101, 102, yes, it's got some improvement to do. We're focused on it, but I think that improvement will accelerate in the second half of the year to the point where we could actually see margin improvement during the fourth quarter. But we're going to have to execute hard on rate plans, work with all our government relations and regulator friends to get those approved, which we know how to do, but it's a \u2013 there's a magnitude of volume of activity that does need to happen. Greg Peters : Right. Makes sense. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color on the call. My first question, Chris, it sounds like you upped the ROE guidance, right, 14 to 15 as it previously been 13 to 14. When going through the pieces of everything, it sounds like it's more a reflection right of just improved investment income and on the fixed income portfolio, but am I missing something in making those observations? Chris Swift : Thanks for joining us, Elyse. I would say, you're right. The NII is a big component, particularly coming off just \u2013 if the interest rate moves in our fixed income portfolio, but as Beth also said, we do expect lower alternative returns this year. But I do think that there is underlying margin improvement in our commercial book of business that maybe is underappreciated. And I would explain that the guidance that we set, I think is prudent as thoughtful, as reactive of the conditions that we have, but we have a high degree of confidence of achieving, particularly at the midpoint. So, from there then, we played to outperform. And I think we've got a good track record of outperforming over time. And that's the mission next year. So, the guidance says what it is and it does imply really when I really measured on a refined basis, about 50 basis points of improvement, but I don't think we're going to be done from there. And all that goes into our views of what our overall ROEs will be next year, including our buyback and programs. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question, you guys are the dividends to the holdco are going to be higher this coming year. [Group] [ph] did go up and I know you guys have, kind of targeted a balanced level of capital return, but given the extra dividends to the holdco, could we expect capital return to pick up in 2023 via share repurchase? Beth Costello : Yes. So Elyse, yes, you're right. The dividends from group benefits are increasing. I would characterize that as, sort of kind of getting back to normal. The last couple of years they've been lower because obviously the statutory results have been impacted by the higher mortality losses. So, we're kind of getting to more of our normal run rate, which we had contemplated when we evaluated the size of the update that we did to our share repurchase authorization. So, I would call the increases just totally in line and we're going to continue to execute on the plan that we have. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Jimmy, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar : Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on workers' comp following up on some of Chris' comments earlier. Obviously, margins have been pretty good and seems like you're expecting that to continue through 2023. Is it reasonable to assume that there's going to be a lot of pushback from regulators in allowing price hikes over even if you look beyond this year until margins get a lot worse from where they are or do you think that at some point over the next one to two years that the market could begin to show signs of an uptick in pricing? Chris Swift : Yes, thank you for joining us today, Jimmy. Again, as I said in my opening remarks, I mean, the trends there are some modest level of deterioration in our combined ratios, principally due to the pricing environment set by various regulators in the experience that the industry has had, I think you're really asking is, when do you see a turn and that's a hard question to ask. But I think the components of a turn in pricing are starting to emerge, particularly as we get through the pandemic period where frequencies were just down due to less economic activity, less work in general, and those usually, the look back period is three years on rate filing. So, if you think of experience in 2019, 2021 that starts to leave your rate filings in 2024. So, I'm optimistic that there can be some at least reversal of negative price trends coming out of NCCI or other rating bureaus to allow maybe modest price increases sometime in 2024 heading into 2025. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then on personal lines, obviously, the loss ratio picked up at the expense ratio declined considerably this quarter, should we assume a similar expense ratio given lower marketing until the loss ratio begins to improve or what are your thoughts on that over the next [year] [ph]? Chris Swift : Well, let me just start and then I'll ask Stephanie to add her planning. Again, this year, we really cut back on marketing, particularly in the fourth quarter to make sure that we had opportunities to add new customers that were really \u2013 could be profitable with us as we earn that in and we just really, sort of slowed down marketing at this point in time. And as we head into 2023 though, as I said, I think we've become rate adequate by the middle of the year and gives us an opportunity to think about marketing slightly differently, but Stephanie, what would you say from a strategy side and then really an expense perspective? Stephanie Bush : I think you captured it well, Chris. A couple other points I'd either underscore add is that, yes, our marketing and media change was intentional in the late third quarter into the fourth quarter. We moved really more to more targeted and very marketing sources. So, I want to confirm that we were still marketing. It's a very dynamic process, marketing source by marketing source, but as Chris mentioned, we believe that we will be new business rate adequate by mid-year in majority of the states and you should expect to see our media spend continue to build throughout the year. And then finally, with that new business rate adequacy, I would expect that we'd begin to start to see new business PIF count growth in the back half of the year. So, think about how all of those components work together. Chris Swift : But Jimmy, just to tie it all together, I would expect on a year to year over basis expenses to be relatively flat. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman of Credit Suisse. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Andrew Kligerman : Great. Good morning. Looking at Slide 16 of your presentation, I see that the annualized investment yield ex LPs has really picked up nicely just Q-over-Q from 3.3% to 3.7%, and we're seeing a little bit of pressure now on rates, but can you talk about where you see that annualized investment yield ex LPs going over the next few quarters? And any insight you could provide there? Beth Costello : Yes, I'll start with that. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, when you look at that number, and you think about for the full-year or on an annualized basis of 3.2, expecting that 50 basis point to 60 basis point increase. When you look at fourth quarter, just a couple of things I think to highlight on that. Is that included in the yield ex partnerships. It's not just fixed maturities, it's also some other items as well. Think about dividends on equities securities and things like that that can sometimes be a little bit lumpy. So, when I think about where we're ending the quarter at 3.7 and sort of going into Q1, probably not expecting to see a big increase quarter-over-quarter, kind of on a run rate basis and that kind of continues as we go through 2023. If you really look just at the fixed maturity yield, we're definitely seeing some increases there and we'd expect to see that as we go through 2023 on that line. And you can see the details in our investor financial supplement of fixed maturities versus some of these other asset classes like equity securities and mortgage loans. So, we see it as a nice trajectory. We obviously had a nice lift this quarter. Our average purchases that we did, the yield was around 6%, which was a bit elevated. I wouldn't expect that to be the norm as we, kind of go into Q1 was a little bit elevated just because we ended the quarter \u2013 ended the third quarter with some excess cash because we had divested of some treasury securities and pretty opportunistically invested at pretty high points from a yield perspective, which drove that up. And I'd expect like looking at January, that 6% is probably more like [5.1%] [ph]. Was that helpful? Andrew Kligerman : Got it. Yes, very helpful. And Chris, I'm just I'm trying to get my arms around this workers' comp issue and when it's going to temper. I know you've already gotten two questions on it. Maybe you could give us a sense of how much \u2013 you mentioned renewal written premium slight negative. What was the rate component for that? Was that a pretty heavy negative? Was that four points down, three points down and with the stellar ratios that Hartford \u2013 and I get that Hartford is probably best-in-class period in workers\u2019 comp. The second part of that question is, with ratios that have been around 90% small and mid, even better than that. Will the regulators allow you to raise rates or will they penalize you for being best-in-class? So, I'm just trying to get my arms around that. Two questions, the rate and then again maybe a little more color on that outlook for getting rate in the future? Chris Swift : Again, thanks for the question. Andrew, I would say it's always better to be best-in-class at anything. So, I'm going to disappoint you and say that look, there's a lot of detail we provided. There's a lot of metrics that you could try and get laid on to just focus on a sub line with really nuanced details from an operating side. All I said is, I really do think the rate, the net rate and the rate then that we get from increasing exposures. So, the exposure that acts like rate is going to be negative next year, slightly negative. And that's all I was saying. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. Maybe I'll just throw a quick one. I was hoping \u2013 I wasn't expecting a detailed answer, but fully insured group benefit sales up 52%, maybe a little color on the products that were quite strong in the quarter? Chris Swift : Yes. I'll let Jonathan add his color. Jonathan Bennett : Sure. In terms of our sales, good numbers in there, yes. Sometimes late in the year you get opportunistically a sale or two. A lot of our business trades in the first quarter. And then some other big numbers will happen oftentimes in at the beginning of the third or maybe the fourth quarter, but so some nice numbers for us in the quarter. Strong disability results for us, I would say, primarily and we continue to see really good response to our voluntary, our supplemental health product set. So, those would include critical illness, hospital indemnity, and accident. And that book has been building for us steadily now for a number of years and had our highest sales numbers in 2022 since inception of those programs. So, I think those are the ones that are really driving at disability and sub health. We continue to compete effectively on the life side, but definitely a stronger mix on the disability and self-help side. Andrew Kligerman : Okay, thanks a lot. Chris Swift : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer, your line is now open. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks. Good morning all. Broadly speaking, can you talk about your [appetite] [ph] for allocating more investments to LPs and alternatives over the next few years given the higher interest rate environment? Chris Swift : Meyer, I had a hard time hearing your question. I don't know if Beth, if you heard the question. Were you asking about the investment philosophy of alternatives or dollar amounts? Meyer Shields : So, really just the plans. I was thinking about it on a percentage basis, whether there is more or less appetite for current cash flows to go to alternatives in LPs? Chris Swift : I would say generally we have our targeted portfolio that we update every year. And I would say generally we had a slight increase to our targeted alternatives. Think of a percent. So, not a meaningful change, but it's something we have really deep skills in. And I think if you look at our performance over a longer period of time, Meyer, you'll see that I think we've outperformed consistently with just lower volatility. So, from a pure sharpen ratio side, I think it's a great trade and we got great partners in that area, particularly in the real estate area, Beth. But what would you add? Beth Costello : I think you captured it well. I mean, it's an asset class that we've been slowly increasing allocation to. And as Chris said, continue to look to do that, but really not in a meaningful change in the overall construct of our portfolio, but as you said, it's an asset class that we've been very pleased with. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful. And obviously, this is overwhelmed by positive news, but we've had a few quarters of adverse development for commercial auto liability, I was hoping you could talk us through that. Beth Costello : Yes. So, we have experienced some large losses that have come through in that book that as we've closed the last several quarters we've decided to increase our reserves there. It is a line also that we're looking very closely at from a rate perspective and continuing to re-underwrite and look at the risks that we're putting on. So, nothing specific that I'd point to, but we have had just a few large losses that we\u2019ve reacted to as we made our quarter-end judgments on reserves. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore. David, your line is now open. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just had a question on the workers' comp loss cost. Chris, I think you said that you expect loss cost to be slightly up, but that includes 5% medical cost severity. Could you just talk about what you're assuming on frequency? Are you assuming negative frequency there? And maybe how we should think about that in the current environment? And then maybe just talk about on the indemnity side as well. Chris Swift : Yes. Thank you for joining us, David. I will just be clarifying \u2013 the trends that I talked about on the loss cost side were relatively flat and stable year-over-year. Medical severity at 5, I didn't give you a frequency number or not, but those trends are fairly consistent. What changed though is, sort of net rate and exposure, that [excess rate] [ph], that is going to be down slightly year-over-year into a slight negative territory. On the wage indemnity side, it's sort of a self-balancing equation from my perspective. We charge more. We collect more as salaries go up and it's sort of a natural hedge for increasing indemnity payments that we get to collect upfront. And then there's a little bit of medical severity benefit because only 50% of loss content in workers' comp is wage. So, that's what I would share with you. Beth Costello : Yes, the only thing maybe I'll \u2013 just to clarify, one item as Chris said, it's a [pretax trend] [ph], right? When we think about the trend relative to loss, we're not making a change year-over-year, but again, as you said, medical severity with 5 points, some of the other items that he referenced wouldn't result in negative trend. So, from a pure loss cost perspective, you'd expect some increase, but all the other components that Chris talked about then also affect overall results. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on, I guess, Chris, you had said, you expect 50 basis points underlying combined ratio improvement in commercial lines and you gave a lot of detail. Just it sounds to me like you expect most of that come from the expense ratio as opposed to the loss ratio, just given the headwind from workers' comp obviously offset by expansion on other lines? Is that the right interpretation? Chris Swift : I would say half-and-half. So, the point of buying ratio improvement in commercial lines year-over-year at the point from expense, at the point from margin. That's what we're confident we're going to achieve. [In place for upside] [ph] in the quarter as we execute during the year. David Motemaden : Hello? Chris Swift : David, sorry, I was on mute. I was going to say no. I think you've misinterpreted a half a point of expense ratio improvement and a half a point of loss ratio improvement and feel highly confident on that. Half a point of, I'll call it loss ratio improvement. And we're going to play for upside from there. Again, highly confident of achieving, sort of those midpoints and we're going to aim to overachieve during the year. David Motemaden : Got it. So, half a point on the underlying loss ratio. So, I guess that would imply I guess you're assuming [1.5 to 2 points] [ph] of expansion on everything excluding comp, I guess. If I just take \u2013 if I just do a weighting, 33% of your book is comp and then the balance I would expect you to get 1.5 points of improvement. Is that the right way to think about it? Chris Swift : Yes. I don't remember having a tough time communicating. I think the overall expense ratio improvement is going to be driven by again expense and then pure loss ratio improvement over the years. But in total, David, I'm expecting a half a point of combined ratio improvement in commercial lines year-over-year, but we start with a negative 0.5 point because of comp. So that means you got to get a point elsewhere. And that point elsewhere, as I said to you, half of it comes from expense and half of it comes from pure loss. And we feel highly confident on achieving that. And we're going to play for upside meaning my language of communicating to you is, I think we're going to outperform that point estimate I just gave you. Is that clear? David Motemaden : That is clear. I appreciate your comments. Operator : Thank you. We will take no further questions for today. So, I'll hand back to Susan Spivak for any further remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Alex. I apologize to those we didn't get to your questions, but we are here all day and we'll reach out and follow-up with you. And thank you all for joining us. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Today, I will begin with a summary of the Hartford's first quarter results, then Beth will dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics. After which, we and our business leaders will be happy to take your questions. So let's get started. We are pleased to begin the year with exceptional results in our Commercial Lines businesses and continued strong results in Group Benefits. Well, industry-wide trends, such as elevated catastrophe losses and persistent inflationary pressure in personal auto, impacted our results. The first quarter also saw topline growth in Commercial Lines of 11%, including double-digit contributions from each business with an underlying combined ratio of 88.5%. Double-digit renewal written price increases across both Auto and Home in Personal Lines. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 8% combined with strong first quarter sales in a core earnings margin of 5.2%. Solid investment results with increasing fixed-income portfolio yields and strong reinvestment rates and a core earnings ROE of 14.3%, while returning $484 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Now let me share first quarter highlights from each of our businesses. We have strong momentum across Commercial Lines and I expect continued topline growth, at highly profitable margins. In addition, accelerating pricing in several lines combined with enhanced underwriting execution, bolsters my confidence and our ability to deliver margins consistent with the 2023 outlook I provided back in February. In Small Commercial, written premiums of $1.3 billion and new business of $242 million set new records for the Hartford. Three years ago, we completed the launch of our enhanced best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum. Over that three-year period, Spectrum written premium has grown significantly. For example, this quarter's written premium is nearly 40% higher than the same period three years ago and the new business premium is almost doubled over that same period. In addition, we've expanded wholesale broker relationships, our excess and surplus lines finding product continues to gain momentum, delivering robust growth. Written premium approximately doubled from a year ago, fueled by a substantial increase in new business. In short, Small Commercial continues to deliver exceptional results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities and is on track to exceed $5 billion of annual written premiums in the near term. In Middle & Large Commercial, written premiums grew 10%, driven by new business growth of 23%, sustained exposure growth in solid renewal written price increases. New business submissions and hit rates were both up and average premium unsold accounts continues to increase. We are particularly pleased by the growth in property lines. The key area of focus and we will continue to capitalize on favorable market conditions. We are committed to getting paid through the CAT in non-CAT risk we underwrite, setting appropriate terms and conditions, and ensuring proper valuations. Our investments in data science capabilities, industry-leading risk segmentation, and exceptional talent have contributed to healthy margins and position us well to continue driving profitable growth in this business. In Global Specialty results, we're outstanding with nearly $4 billion of annual gross written premium. Our competitive position, breadth of products, and solid renewal written pricing drove a 10% increase in net written premium with significant contributions from Global Reinsurance. We are excited about our position in the wholesale market in the ongoing benefits from our broadening product portfolio. Execution has never been stronger and our enhanced underwriting capabilities are driving market share gains. Turning to pricing. Commercial lines renewal written pricing was 4.5% compared to 5.2% in the fourth quarter. Excluding worker's compensation, U.S. Standard Commercial lines renewal written pricing rose to 8.1% with middle-market property pricing in excess of 10% and Standard Commercial Auto near 7%. Worker's compensation pricing remained positive, continuing to benefit from the stronger-than-expected average wage growth. Within Global Specialty, Property, Auto, Primary Casualty, and Marine, all generated strong pricing results well in excess of loss cost trends. In excess casualty, pricing is becoming more competitive, while public D&O pricing remains under pressure. Within financial lines, we have been shifting our focus to private companies, in management and professional liability, where market pricing and margins are more attractive while maintaining underwriting discipline in the public space. Across Commercial Lines, long-term loss cost trends in our book remained stable and excluding worker's compensation, the margin between renewal written pricing and aggregate loss cost trends has expanded modestly. As we continue to execute our strategy across Commercial Lines, I want to reiterate my confidence in our ability to manage the book through a variety of economic and market conditions, with superior underwriting margins and continued premium growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Moving to Personal Lines. The Auto loss cost environment is very dynamic, across market participants, the level of continued severity increases has had a meaningful impact on industry results. As a result, active management of rate filings in response to the changing landscape is paramount. We achieved renewal written price increases of 10% in the first quarter and expect it to accelerate into the high teens later this year. In the first quarter, approved rate filings averaged 18.3%, more than double, than the fourth quarter result of 8.3%. Given the vast majority of our book as 12-month policies, it will take time for the rate increases to fully earn in. With continued elevated loss trends reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, we have adjusted our rate execution plan and as a result, new business rate adequacy will build throughout the year as filings are approved. We expect new business rate adequacy in most states by year-end. Overall, I am confident we have the right strategy and with focused execution, expect to achieve Auto profitability target in 2024 across the book. In homeowners, results were quite strong with renewal written pricing of 13.9% in the quarter, comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpacing loss cost trends. Turning to Group Benefits. We are off to a strong start. Core earnings reflect a significant improvement. We have seen in mortality trends versus prior year, including decreasing impacts from pandemic-related losses. Lower pandemic-related mortality is a welcome and encouraging trend. While it is still too early to reach firm conclusions on long-term mortality trends, we expect they will settle above pre-pandemic levels in our pricing business accordingly. We continue to measure the effects of the pandemic and believe we are well prepared to adjust course, as necessary. In disability, our capabilities are market-leading and we remain positive on the performance and outlook of our book. Looking at new business, sales of $474 million were up $85 million over prior year. This was our second-highest sales quarter ever. Importantly, we're competing effectively across all market segments from small businesses to the largest U.S. enterprises. As a Group Benefits market leader, we are well-positioned to capitalize on rapidly evolving customer requirements for absence management, group life, and supplemental health products and services. We continue to strengthen our reputation for customer service with an extensive suite of tools for HR platform integration, member enrollment, process simplification, and analytics. Employers are more focused than ever on the needs of their employees, and our products and services are a key component of that value proposition. Moving now to investments. The portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic objectives, while performing well across a range of asset classes and economic cycles. That will provide further details, Beth would highlight, it was another quarter of solid net investment income with negligible impairments. Recognizing that commercial real estate is topical, let me take a minute to comment on our approach to that market. We have dedicated teams of experienced professionals with a long and successful track record of investing in the commercial real estate sector. We believe the market provides attractive yields and risk-adjusted returns, while providing a source of diversification to our investment portfolio. We have approximately $6 billion of commercial mortgage loans, primarily consisting of multifamily and industrial holdings with less than 10% invested in commercial offices. We regularly review our property valuation for the impact of lower occupancy levels, higher cap rates and the impact of rising interest rates. These assessments, give us confidence, the portfolio will continue to perform well through the economic cycle. Well, perhaps a bit distinct from other property and casualty appears, we believe these holdings are an attractive alternative to investment grade corporate credit, as they provide approximately 80 to 100 basis points of additional spread over rated corporates. In closing, as we look ahead, we anticipate continued growth in strong margins across our businesses. Our financial performance demonstrates the power of the franchise. The depth of our distribution relationships and our commitment to superior customer experience and excellent execution by our 19,000 employees. With these competitive advantages, I remain confident that we can continue to deliver superior results. The Hartford has never been better positioned to deliver industry-leading financial performance, highlighted by a core earnings ROE range of 14% to 15%, while creating value for all stakeholders. Now let me turn it over to Beth to provide more commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $536 million or $1.68 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.3%. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $436 million, with an underlying combined ratio of 88.5%, in line with our expectations for the first quarter, which was embedded in the full-year outlook provided in February. Small Commercial continued to deliver excellent results with an underlying combined ratio of 89.5%. The first quarter included higher non-CAT property losses compared to unusually low losses in the prior year quarter and in modestly higher loss ratio in worker's compensation as expected. This is the 11th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio of below 90%. Middle & Large Commercial delivered a record 89.9%, a 1.6 point improvement from the prior year due to favorable non-CAT property losses and expense improvement. Global Specialties underlying margin improved 3 points from a year ago to an outstanding 85.2%, which benefited from lower international losses and an improved expense ratio. In Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was 187,000 with an underlying combined ratio of 97%. Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 78.9% was in line with expectations. All results reflected continued liability and physical damage severity pressure driven by among other things, elevated repair costs, increased used car valuations, and a modest uptick in attorney representation rates. The auto underlying combined ratio was approximately 12 points higher than the prior-year quarter, which is about 5.5 points above our expectations. As we progressed through the first quarter, we began to see indications that there was a pronounced step change in loss activity. The first signal of this was in our February data and at that time, we did not view this as a sustained trend, but an area to watch. As we monitor loss activity in March, claim frequency remained in line with our expectations, but we observed additional pressure on claim severities for both the current accident quarter and accident year 2022. For example, with respect to our physical damage coverages, we observed a lengthening time to repair vehicles and an increase in the mix of total losses versus repairable. For bodily injury coverages, we continue to experience a mix-shift to more severe accidents. Taking all this data into consideration, we booked the current quarter at an underlying combined ratio of 105.1. We also recorded prior year development of $20 million related to accident year 2022, auto physical damage losses, which was primarily related to the fourth quarter activity. For auto liability, we recorded no net increase in prior year reserves as elevated activity in 2022 was offset by improvement in accident years 2021 and prior. As Chris indicated, the team continues to file for rate increases to offset the loss cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 6% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. The expense ratio decrease of 1.1 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spends. With respect to CAT, there were over 20 TCS designated events this quarter resulting in property and casualty current accident year CAT losses of $185 million, which includes the impacts from significant winter storms along the East and West Coasts and Tornado wind and hail events across several regions of the United States. Total net prior accident year development was essentially zero as reserve reductions in worker's compensation and package business were offset by reserve increases in auto physical damage and general liability. Workers' compensation reserves were reduced primarily in Small Commercial, driven by favorable claim severity experience and a $20 million reduction in COVID-related reserves from the 2020 accident year. Turning to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the first quarter of $90 million and the 5.2% core earnings margin reflect lower group life and disability loss ratios and growth in fully insured premiums. As a reminder, from a seasonality perspective, we tend to experience higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter. So we would expect the margin to be lower than our full-year estimate. Earnings for the quarter benefited from a 12 points reduction in the Group life loss ratio reflecting improvement in the mortality trend as the prior-year loss ratio was significantly impacted by the pandemic. Also positively impacting earnings for the quarter was 2.8 points improvement in the disability loss ratio, due to favorable long-term disability incidents. Fully insured ongoing premium growth was 8%, reflecting growth from existing customers as well as strong persistency and new business sales. Premium growth also benefited from continued strong employment trends as well as our focus on enhancing the enrollment experience of our customers. Our diversified investment portfolio produced solid results, amidst Financial Sector volatility. For the quarter, net investment income was $515 million. Our fixed-income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 3.8% before tax, modestly higher than the fourth quarter. Our annualized limited partnership returns were 2.5% in the quarter. These returns were slightly better than we had estimated as private equity annualized returns of 9%, partially offset negative returns in our real estate portfolio given fund valuations and the absence of underlying property sales as we expected. Looking forward, while it is still early in the quarter, we believe second quarter LP results will be similar to first quarter. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Given the interest in real estate holdings and baking exposure, we have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck. We have less than 600,000 in holdings in the three failed regional banks, primarily through index investing and we had no Credit Suisse AT1. As you can see in the disclosures provided, we own approximately $6 billion of commercial mortgage loans, which are concentrated in multifamily, industrial, and grocery-anchored centers with limited office exposure. Our portfolio is focused on high-growth geographic areas. Average LTV is 52%, and importantly, we have stressed our properties for lower valuations and are comfortable that the '23 and '24 maturities are manageable. We also own $3.3 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities. These holdings are secured by a diverse pool of properties with significant levels of subordination. We complete underlying loan level analysis for these holdings and also expect '23 and '24 maturities will be manageable. Turning to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares for $350 million. As of the end of the quarter, we have $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. We recognize the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, but we are well-positioned to deliver consistent sustained industry-leading results. Our success is a direct result of our steadfast operational excellence. I will now turn it back to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thank you. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, if you could repeat the process for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. First question on guidance, I'm just curious. Personal lines, obviously, running pretty elevated above kind of where your range and guidance is, what gives you confidence, you're going to be able to make your guidance number for the year in Personal Auto? And then also on Commercial Lines, you're running above kind of the midpoint of the range, should we see the underlying combined ratio to continue to improve here going forward in Commercial? Chris Swift : Brian, it's Chris. Thanks for joining us. I think you're asking questions about Personal Lines and Commercial and probably the implications overall. So what I would say, on Personal Lines its clearly, we're facing more headwinds than we anticipated a quarter ago. We've run various scenarios and I would share with you again Personal Auto. Is that -- if the elevated inflation severity pressures we feel in the first quarter continued in the second and third quarter. And then it begins to revert in the fourth quarter and that probably puts about four to six points of loss ratio pressure on the auto expectations we had for the full year. I think then on your Commercial Lines your question remained highly confident, highly. That we will achieve the objectives and targets set out for a couple of reasons; one, the earned premium impact is increasing and it will increase over the next three quarters based on what we've written, second half of last year, and then into this year. I think also if we've talked to you and others about the business mix that we're trying to shift. Obviously, more casualty, more property and that will have the opportunity to contribute to overall margin improvements. And then third is something we don't maybe talk enough about is just our underwriting initiatives to improve risk selection, improve our overall margins that is happening in all the businesses. Whether it'd be middle market and Global Specialty or small, so I think we have all the initiatives in place that will build throughout the year. Both on our loss ratio and our expense ratio, we didn't get additional leverage to that demonstrates and I see it in our numbers that we will achieve the goals that we set out for the year. Brian Meredith : Great, that's really helpful. And then Chris, I'm just curious, the reinsurance business, we talk about it much, but it's becoming a decent-sized business. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what's in that reinsurance book? Is it a property book? Is it a casualty book? How should we think about it, it will create some additional volatility you're going forward? Chris Swift : Yes, I would have Mo maybe add his color, but I would say it's a diversified book, it's a diversified book of property and casualty. We've been in it, it's obviously up since we've acquired Navigators, it's a very thoughtful team, a very thoughtful approach. But it does contribute to growing our property, which I think we shared with you is a key initiative and Global Re this quarter basically grew its premium base over last year about 21% with 30% pricing improvement in property. So it's a U.S. book, it does have a little bit of global exposure. But I think it's performing very well and it's going to contribute. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. My first question is with regards to Global Specialty pricing. Maybe you can talk about where you see that going over the course of the year. And also, is it still ahead of loss trends, because it just seemed like -- I think one of your competitors on the specialty side was talking about 8% loss trends in specialty, so I would just want to verify that. Chris Swift : Yes. I would say in Global Specialty, it's just got to take public company D&O out, because it's such an outlier and I don't than it give you a couple of data points, both in our international and domestic public company D&O public company books, which it's about $200 million of gross premium. I mean, rates are negative 20% or greater. So when I think, I've sort of our book and business mix in total. I'll give you another stat, it's in our investor slides that we put out there. But Commercial Lines ex-comp pricing is up 6.8%. But if I exclude the public company P&L that 6.8 goes to 7.7 and that's 7.7% is well in excess of our long-term. Cost of goods sold increases that we're expecting, so we still have a meaningful healthy margin, if you included. It's meaningful about 100 basis points and if you exclude public company D&O that probably goes up to 200 basis points of spread. So you put it all together and it is a pressure point, it's a small line of business. But that's why, you probably see that we're being very sensitive on how much we right, we're willing to let business go that doesn't meet our hurdle rates, which will impact the top line, but it will protect the bottom line. Yaron Kinar : Got it. Mo Tooker : Maybe just to add, this is Mo. I think we feel particularly good about the lines outside of public D&O. I think we're growing the marine book at nice rates for wholesale auto, wholesale property books. Those are all really additive to the margin expansion, that Chris is talking about. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. And then maybe a quick one on Florida Tort Reform, do you see that having any impact on your businesses whether on the personnel side or commercial? Mo Tooker : Well I mean, the Florida Tort Reform is obviously a welcome development to help contribute to making Florida more trouble and stable state, whether it'd be some of the statutes that we're provided, there are one-way attorney's fees being limited, contributory negligence, shortening sort of period that you could file suit. So all that is positive. I think if you're at -- if you're really asking the question, is there any short-term impacts on potential elevated litigation in suits being filed, we don't think so. And if it is controlled and contained within our loss picks, particularly in our BI bucket. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on Personal Auto. So Chris, you mentioned that you guys still expect to get back to your target margins in that business in '24. Obviously, you and everyone else in the industry is still seeing elevated trends to start this year or so why are you still convinced you can get there next year or is it just that in response to the trend you guys are pushing for more price than previously expected? Chris Swift : Yes. I would just add like high-level commentary and then ask Stephanie to add hers. But I think Elyse what you described and my words is simple math, right. We got loss trends that are remaining elevated, inflation is sticky, there are some severity pressure on totals versus repairable as Beth mentioned. But at the end of the day, even though it works on a lag effect, the data will support raising rates. And as we said, we've got 10 points of written rate in the book this quarter on a file basis, and approved basis in the states. We've 18.3%, so the cumulative effect of rate increases pruning the book, it gives us confidence that we can achieve our target margins in 2024. But Stephanie what would you add? Stephanie Bush : Chris. I think you framed it well. Elyse, our strategy remains unchanged at rate adequacy, focused towards achieving profitability in 2024 and our prevail launch. So the 10 points would you see sequentially over the prior quarters is a meaningful step-change. And again the rate, the 18 plus that we have approved those filings, it's truly a reflection of the rate that we're getting and how that will work its way through the book. And as Beth and Chris alluded to in their prepared remarks. What we observed in the first quarter has already been contemplated and put into our rate filings. So it's a dynamic process and one that we're working hard on every single day, but that gives us confidence. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question is on Commercial Lines. So you guys in response to a prior question pointed to earning in rate and there are some expenses that are going to flow through as well. Should we expect that the year-over-year improvement that you're looking for pickup, as we go through the next three quarters, meeting be the greatest in the fourth quarter as the rate continues to earn-in or is there any other seasonality we need to pay attention to when thinking about the back three quarters of the year? Beth Costello : Yes. I don't think there's any seasonality we need to pay attention to explicitly. But I do believe over the next three quarters, you'll see improvement in the loss ratio and the expense ratio. Given what we've talked about earned rate. Coming in business mix shifting for us. So all those will contribute to that improvement. Elyse, I think we've talked with you and others about our guidance. Remember, we guided to 87 to 89, we finished last year at 88.3. We believe based on the first quarter and the data that we're seeing for the next three that we will be able to improve from that 88.3 last year, whether it would be 3 times a point or 5 times a point, we don't have to debate that today, but it will improve and then, fundamentally driven by loss ratio improvement, expense ratio improvement offset by some of the headwinds that we feel in workers' comp. So those are the three main components of how we get to combined ratio improvement on an underlying basis from a -- from last year to this year. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Alex Scott : Hi, good morning. First one I had is little bit of a housekeeping item. When you guys mentioned higher non-CAT losses in commercial relative to the depressed level last year. How did those non-CAT losses this quarter compared to I guess a more normal expectation? I just wasn't sure whether to interpret that as higher than normal or not? Chris Swift : No. I'll add my color and I'll ask Beth to add hers. But I would say between small and middle right on expectation for the year. Small ran a little hot and Middle and large ran better than expected, but is there anything else there Beth that you would add? Beth Costello : No, I think you captured it well, as we again look at both small and middle little bit offsetting relative to little elevated in small Commercial and a benefit in middle market. Alex Scott : Got it and then my follow-up is on workers' comp. I guess, when you guys are thinking about loss trend there. It seems like you probably maintained a pretty high loss trend in line with sort of the 5% positive loss trend you've been booking. I just wanted to get some thoughts on the way that you're thinking through like frequency versus severity within that? And I mean, are you giving yourself credit for the lower frequency post-pandemic? The way that we've seen some of your larger peers there? Chris Swift : So, Alex. I think we've talked at year-end about frequency and severity trends. I would just reiterate. right in-line with our expectations. Maybe even slightly better on the severity side and I think we've talked about that. The trend on severity when we price for initially reserve for 5%. But last year and then continuing into this year, we're outperforming that. And we do have a frequency expectation that it will improve or a negative frequency, but we're not providing that data on a granular basis. Alex Scott : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : Thanks, good morning. So, Chris, you spoke about the components of improving the underlying combined ratio and commercial in 2023 versus 2022. Any how we can see the expense ratio. So wanted to look at the underlying loss ratio here in the first quarter in-line with expectations with what you guys have out. I'm wondering, if you could talk about the different dynamics there between comp and then excluding comp, what's the year-over-year deterioration just all workers' comp or was there anything else in there? And it sounds like you're expecting a non-comp to pick-up and improve over the rest of the year. But just wanted to get a little bit more color on that. Chris Swift : Yes, David, happy to talk through that. The best way we can. I would start by saying is year-over-year and compared to our expectations are generally right in-line, right. So if you want to quibble about a 10th of a point or two 10th of a point. Okay, but I'm not. And so again is always going to be put and takes, but from the year-over-year, we're offsetting the headwind in comp with other margin expansion in other lines of business. And it's sort of across the board and it's once in two 10ths here and there, but again that gives us confidence that, that we have the ability to continue that throughout the year, the rest of the year. And again I would just point out particularly in property. As we are really focused on growing our property book, and I think we've talked about it. We've got about $2 billion of commercial lines property book. We grew that first-quarter over first-quarter, as I said 18%. And if I look at pricing, particularly in our Standard Commercial Lines pricing is up 12%, wholesale is up 24%, Global Retail is up 30%. So we are getting a meaningful lift in property and that's going to mix in and will help the overall margins. I would say again, our general liability and casualty and specialty casualty lines, our industry verticals in certain areas are also running high-single digits to low-double digits with price increases, which will contribute. We are feeling a little pressure as I said in public company D&O and also a little pressure in our excess casualty book primarily construction. And I would say there's two primary reasons for that pressure both top line and then a little bit on pricing is, competition is moving in there and then there's fewer projects that's taking longer to get financing lined up for it. So it's a little bit of a perfect storm for some pressure there, but we're going to remain disciplined and try to protect our margins there. So those are the components, I put together, David. And I hope you were able to follow that. David Motemaden : Yes, that was great. I appreciate that color. And then maybe just a follow-up. It sounded like loss trend roughly stable in Commercial Lines and in the quarter. Obviously, a very dynamic environment especially on the liability lines side. Have you thought about any your expectations going forward? I think last quarter you had spoken about some expectation for property, severity, moderating towards the second half of the year. And then also just maybe talk about your sort of thoughts on liability loss costs, as we had through the rest of the year? Chris Swift : Yes. I don't think there's anything new to add, I don't actually -- I don't think I follow exactly what you're getting at. But all I would say is, our property book is $2 billion, I think it performs well, we're trying to grow it. As we grow it, we might have a little bit more volatility from quarter-to-quarter, just as fortuitous events happen, still feel good about our reinsurance protection in all our property, either per risk or aggregate basis. So it's nothing new to talk about in property Mo, unless you would add anything. Okay? Mo Tooker : No, I just say on liability we continue to and this is going back two or three years now, we've been working really hard on the segmentation and making sure we're looking at the right jurisdictions, thinking about attachment points, thinking about our limits management. So I think there's a pretty aggressive strategy that we use over the past couple of years to stay ahead of some of the trends that we're seeing now, which refers back to when Chris talks about underwriting initiatives, those are the types of things that he is talking about. David Motemaden : Got it, thanks so much. I appreciate it. Chris Swift : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Greg, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to your comments around D&O and the pricing being down 20%. Maybe Christian, while you can talk about, are there barriers to entry and D&O? I would have imagined for public companies, there is some component of switching costs if they go from one carrier to the next. And just as it relates to your position in the market, do you have the flexibility to come and go based on underwriting conditions, or does the business require you to stick with customers but perhaps at a reduced level of participation? Jonathan Bennett : Yes, Greg. I'll start. Yes, I think what we've seen and I know several of our competitors have talked about it is the number of new entrants into this space, especially on an excess basis. At the same time, exposures have dropped away, whether that be spacks or D-spacks or just IPOs in general. I think it's important to note also that we as Chris talked about earlier, it's a relatively small part of our financial lines booking is -- the D&O is the $200 million that Chris referenced. And I don't think there is anything holding us in that market, we have been really working hard on risk quality day-by day-on risk-by-risk to make decisions as we decide which ones we will stay with and which ones we won't. But at the same time, we are also pivoting resources towards other parts of the financial lines book, like management liability, like professional liability, Small Commercial, Middle Market types of customers. So I think we're trying to be fairly nimble in the face of what is a precipitous drop in the public D&O market, but we see opportunities throughout that portfolio in other ways. Chris Swift : Greg. I would add is, there are differences in relationships on the primary side versus the access side. We're primarily access players and towers, you do have a little bit more flexibility to come and go, which as most said, it creates the opportunity for new capital and new entrants to come in. Let's see a little bit more stability on the primary side, but that's just my point of view. Greg Peters : Makes sense. I'm going to switch gears, the Group Benefits business in your comments, you look at the results. I think you said second best quarter for new sales. Is this coming across the spectrum or are you gaining more share and a different component of smaller business, middle-sized businesses? And I guess, as I think about the outlook in the sort of step change in the market and your position in the market or is just -- or is there something going on with your distribution network that's giving you an advantage over your peers? Chris Swift : Yes, Greg. I'll ask Jonathan to comment, but I would say. As I said in my prepared remarks. I mean, we're growing in all segments. Clearly, we're still recognized as a market leader in national accounts, that's probably 60% of our book, but we do want to continue to focus and grow in the other segments and improve our offerings there. But I think it's just the cumulative impact of what our brand stands for in this space and it's totally important today we're investing, as I said before. You're right. I think we're recognized as one of the premium organizations in the benefit space both disability life, all our supplemental products. And we're trying to take advantage of it, while remaining disciplined to get appropriate rates and returns for this book. But Jonathan, what would you add? Jonathan Bennett : Chris. All the right points to start with on the conversation for sales, the national account business is fortuitous, every year is a bit of a different market, not every customer comes to market every year and so opportunities present in different ways at different times. We had a nice run on some national account business, which we're excited to add to our book. So that continues and we feel like we are a strong player in the large case market and we'll continue to compete there. But we are focused very much, as we work ourselves down into what we call regional accounts and then the smaller and mid-size enterprises. And I think we're seeing good success through our distribution channels there, number of our initiatives it's pretty well we've been focused on things like enrollment. I had a strong season last year, I think it's an intersection of benefits awareness and interest from employees and employers to add new lines, new coverages and to access those along with our improved enrollment capabilities coming online, really it's a great time to take advantage of that interest in helping us to drive more new sales in overall top line. So those things coming together along with a market cycle that worked well for us in National. I think it produced a great result here in the first quarter of '23. Greg Peters : Got it, all right, thanks for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from BMO. Mike, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Hi, Chris, good morning. I guess first question -- thank you for the additional commercial real estate disclosure. I mean, I'm sure you and most analysts have done a lot of questions on that asset class. I'm now just curious, is there a scenario and appreciative that it's been a very profitable and remains a very profitable asset class, but is there a scenario where it would make prudent sense to ever hold back on capital management a bit, if stress and pockets of that asset class were to persist or get worse or that just you guys have had the granularity as it just not -- does that does not make makes sense given maybe the headlines are worse than the reality. Thanks. Chris Swift : Yes, Mike. I'll would say, and I'll ask Beth to add her color is details matter, location matters, property type matters, experience with lenders or excuse me, borrowers and developer matters. So we're pretty confident in our ability to manage this through a cycle here that we're approaching and still have optimal flexibility with our balance sheet and capital, but Beth what would you add? Stephanie Bush : Yes, I would agree with that. I mean, we regularly stress all aspects of our business and evaluate our overall capital levels and take that into consideration when we execute on our share repurchases and so forth. And sitting here today, as you can see from our results, we're continuing on path that we've been on and feel very good with the overall strength of the balance sheet. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great. And my follow-up, you guys have touched on this in prior calls, but the Small Commercial New business momentum has continued and any changing dynamics there that allowed Hartford to win even more is just kind of the normal, Bob that you guys are known for doing so well and any changing dynamics there would be helpful. Thanks. Chris Swift : I'll let Stephanie add it, but I'll just repeat what I said in my prepared remarks. Consciously, I mean, we built a new product with new technology. Amazon-like features, easy to use intuitive, both for CSR's and then our direct customers. So it doesn't happen by mistake, it's very intentional. As for what we're trying to achieve investing in. Particularly some of the latest developments in the excess and surplus lines. That we're going to attack quite aggressively in the marketplace. But Stephani what would you say? Stephanie Bush : It's a terrific question. It's a phenomenal franchise. As Beth stated 11 quarters in a row with a sub 90 underlying combined ratio, record-breaking new business growth, all lines growing, stable retention, strong pricing, ex-work comp and we're incredibly skilled at the workers' compensation line, successfully navigate historically through multiple economic scenarios. We really are the standard for ease accuracy and consistency in this space. And our agents have come to expect a seamless digital experience that values their time and provides the right coverage for their clients. So we just really believe, we have the winning formula for this space. Our greatest competition is ourselves and we're off to a tremendous start. And as Chris mentioned, we're pacing towards another milestone of $5 billion. Mike Zaremski : If I could, just a direct follow-up on this. You've mentioned E&S and I think the last couple of calls in regards to Small Commercial. Is that a new initiative like there or is that just happened open up a new TAM that for small commercial E&S like the likes of Kyndryl are in? Or just any color there would be great? Thank you very much. Stephanie Bush : Sure E&S binding and small business, a terrific story, it's a wonderful and attractive addition to our overall franchise. And candidly, it's opened up another $7.5 billion of the addressable market for us and we're focused on growing the property and liability lines. We're very pleased with the results. It's a growing and accretive portion of our business and expect that to grow meaningfully over time. So it's a it's a terrific offering, we have tremendous wholesale relationships and it's just allowing us to be to create more capability and offering in the total small business universe. Thank you. Operator : Our next question for today comes from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you, good morning. What your competitors mentioned that California workers' comp is showing signs of firming, which is ahead of the rest of the market are you seeing that too? Chris Swift : Yes, I read that. I would say we're probably a little more. Sanguine and cautious. That's also. Tracy Benguigui : Or is there any other tougher states that are showing early signs of firming at this stage? Chris Swift : I would say. We're watching for green shoots. Very closely. We report if we see any green shoots. Tracy Benguigui : Chris, you mentioned that the auto headwinds should add four to six points of loss ratio pressure on your auto expectations that you had for the full year. So how should that influenced your personal Lines underlying combined ratio guide of 93%, 95% for 23, which is auto and homeowners? Chris Swift : Yes. I would have. Expected to be able to do the math on that, but that's all I'm prepared to say at this point in time. You can see the premium waiving you can see the history. I think you can make a reasonable estimate Tracy Benguigui :  Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : Yes, good morning, everyone. Maybe I am doing this wrong, but. I looked at the commercial segment. In last year in the first quarter, you had $1.2 billion of claims payments and in the first quarter of '23, $1.4 billion, but you paid the Boy Scouts settlement. This quarter, which is $787 million, which maybe -- I am doing wrong if substantially reduces your claim payments in Commercial and overall to a number that assumption was low. I mean, I don't have the full-time series in front of me, but I don't think it's been that loan a decade. Am I doing this wrong or is it going to be? Stephanie Bush : Yes, actually doing it wrong. Okay, yes, Josh, actually doing it wrong, we yes, we'll help you out. We paid the Boy Scouts settlement last week in April, so the Boy Scout settlement is not in the first quarter numbers that you're looking at and we have that disclosed in our 10-Q. Josh Shanker : All that said, March 28 in the queue. Maybe I read it wrong. Okay, that's it, that's my only question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Han from KBW. Derek, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Derek Han : Good morning, thanks a lot. Just going back Small Commercial new business premiums. I'm just curious, superior benefiting at all from the smaller regional mutual companies. I really can't stand. The increase in property-related volatility and whether you think that's going to have an impact on growth may be throughout 23 as well. Stephanie Bush : Our growth comes from a variety of sources both organic new business starts and various industries we track. Prior carrier and current carrier where we're getting the business problem and it's pretty widespread. So we are we find those opportunities and capitalize on them. Derek Han : Got it, thank you. And then just a quick numbers question. I think Chris, you said the margin between pricing and loss trend has improved modestly. I think previously it was about 100 bps, is that kind of growing 120 bps, if you can kind of quantify that there'll be helpful. Thank you. Chris Swift : So, Derek. I would say 10 to 20 bps area. G Derek Han : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time. I will hand the call-back over to Susan Spivak, for any further remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you all for joining us today and as always, please reach out with any additional questions if we didn't get to your questions on the call today, we are available this afternoon and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Last night, we reported strong financial and operational performance for the second quarter, completing a successful first half of the year. While we and the industry continue to navigate a dynamic market environment including elevated catastrophe losses and persistent inflationary pressure in personal auto, once again, we achieved exceptional results in Commercial Lines and outstanding performance in Group Benefits. Highlights of the second quarter include top line growth in Commercial Lines of 12%, including double-digit contributions from each business with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 7%, with a core earnings margin of 7.6%. Strong investment performance with increasing fixed income portfolio yields and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 13.6%, while returning $484 million of capital to shareholders. These results only strengthen my confidence in our ability to deliver a 2023 core earnings ROE in the range of 14% to 15%. Now let me dive deeper into our second quarter performance for each of our businesses. Momentum is strong in Commercial Lines. I expect continued top line growth at highly profitable margins during the second half of 2023, with full year underlying combined ratio targets unchanged. In Small Commercial, written premium of $1.3 billion and new business of $237 million continue near record high levels. Our best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum, continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace. Spectrum new business premium of over $100 million was up 23% over prior year. Our unmatched ease of doing business with agents and customers and our unrivaled pricing accuracy and consistency remain important drivers as demonstrated by strong sales and retention and a 6% year-over-year increase in policies in force. In addition, written premium for our excess and surplus lines binding product eclipsed $50 million in the quarter, up nearly 60% from a year ago, with new business growth of just over 85%. Our expanding wholesale broker relationships are expected to drive continued robust growth and profitability for this important line. In short, Small Commercial continues to deliver outstanding results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities and is on track to exceed $5 billion of annual written premium in the near-term. Middle and Large commercial had an exceptional quarter. Written premiums were at their highest levels ever, up 12% in the quarter, driven by strong momentum in new business with elevated submissions and hit rates along with increasing average account premium. Cross-sell activities remain in full force and are helping to drive new business results. Written premium grew across almost all lines with excellent growth in our construction, energy, and entertainment verticals. In addition, we are particularly pleased by the 24% top line growth in middle-market property lines, which remains a key area of focus and accretive part of this business. Looking across the enterprise, as discussed in prior quarters, we are taking thoughtful and disciplined steps using industry-leading tools to grow our property book within favorable market conditions. These efforts should put us in a position to expand commercial property written premium to approximately $2.5 billion or up 25% by year-end. Underlying margins in Middle and Large Commercial were also at record levels, reflecting advancements in data science capabilities, industry-leading pricing and underwriting tools and exceptional talent, all of which position us well to maintain profitable growth in this business. Global Specialty continues to deliver outstanding results with net written premium growth of 15% in the quarter. New business growth and improving renewal written pricing were important contributors. In addition, we remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and the ongoing benefits to the top line from our broadened product portfolio, U.S. Ocean Marine, Environmental, International, and Global Reinsurance all achieved double-digit top line increases. Our underwriting discipline, along with enhanced capabilities developed over the past few years are driving targeted market share gains with a stellar underlying combined ratio that has hovered in the mid-80s for the past five quarters. In short, our execution has never been stronger. Turning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal pricing of 5.2% compared to 4.5% in the first quarter. Excluding workers\u2019 compensation, renewal pricing rose to 7.5%, up eight-tenths sequentially with accelerating pricing in property and auto. Across commercial, property pricing is well into the double-digits with auto in the high single-digits, pricing in other liability and casualty lines also remained strong, while public D&O pricing remains challenged. In addition, workers\u2019 compensation pricing remained slightly positive. All-in, our strong written pricing performance in Commercial Lines, combined with stable loss cost trends, bolsters my confidence in our ability to maintain or slightly improve margins going forward. Moving to Personal Lines. Persistent severity loss increases in auto have had a meaningful influence on overall industry results. We continue to respond with significant pricing actions. During the quarter, we achieved renewal written price increases of 13.8% and expect acceleration to above 20% by the fourth quarter. As loss cost trends emerge, we will aggressively push for appropriate rate actions. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.4% in the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. We are very selective and actively manage our homeowners\u2019 book at a state and territory level, diligently managing risk and growth with sophisticated underwriting capabilities that allow us to effectively manage new business risk selection. A few examples of our risk management include the action we took many years ago to stop writing new homeowners business in Florida, a conservative stance on coastal CAT risk and wildfire mitigation efforts that have yielded strong outcomes. We are on the right path in personal lines, driving towards appropriate pricing and managing exposure and growth while continuing to serve our customers with award-winning service. In Group Benefits, I am pleased with both top line and bottom line performance, including an outstanding core earnings margin of 7.6%. Group disability continues to post strong results driven by favorable long-term disability incidence trends and claim recoveries. In Group Life, the loss ratio was up versus prior year. Mortality losses in the second quarter continued to run above pre-pandemic levels, but improved sequentially. Looking at the top line, growth was driven by book persistency above 90% plus strong year-to-date new sales. Overall, the strength of our diversified product portfolio as well as our commitment to outstanding customer experience through the use of data and technology resonates in this marketplace, giving us a leadership position. Moving now to investments. I want to highlight another quarter of strong performance as fixed income yields continue to trend higher with solid credit results. Beth will provide further details. Before concluding, I would like to comment on the advances we continue to make in technology and the competitive advantage it brings to our businesses and distribution partners, along with a superior customer experience. At our Investor Day in November of 2021, I highlighted the significant investments we had made in our core technology platforms which were allowing us to extend our digital and data capabilities. Back then, we were already focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance execution, and today, AI is mainstream at The Hartford. The breadth and depth of our data and analytics and AI has grown into all parts of our business, and is enabling greater agility and faster decision-making while improving and streamlining the experiences of our customers and distribution partners. While some organizations talk about what they expect to do in the future, we are already doing this at scale. With several hundred AI models in production and driving business results, we believe our capabilities are leading-edge. Let me give you just one example of how we are already using what we call our information advantage, fueled by advanced analytics and AI to drive results. We developed an award-winning medical record digestion and extraction tool that has transformed the way we conduct our workers\u2019 compensation business. This tool ingest and translates medical records into digital content, characterizes the data and highlights relevant information. In workers\u2019 compensation, we are streamlining the adjudication process by suppressing 30% of the extraneous information contained in medical records that otherwise results in significant distraction or lost time to our claim handlers. Since inception of this tool, we have processed more than 500 million pages of medical records, and perhaps more importantly established a foundation for next level AI use cases across our business. When it comes to generative AI, we are actively experimenting with this technology in a highly controlled environment. Now, Hartford understands the potential of this technology and we believe we\u2019re at the forefront in piloting use cases that will augment the capabilities of our employees. All the transformational work we have done over the past three years or four years has put us in a strong position to accelerate our market leading competitive advantage driven by technology, data science, in our experienced workforce. In closing, we have a unique portfolio of diverse yet complementary businesses that contribute to our industry-leading returns. As we have reached the mid-point of 2023, it\u2019s a good time to reiterate our strategic priorities that we believe will continue to drive our success. First, leveraging our product breadth and competitive advantage across the P&C and group benefits platforms will drive profitable organic growth. Second, underwriting discipline will guide a balanced risk profile supporting long-term book value growth. Third, we will continue to prioritize digital, analytics, and data science investments and enhance the customer and agent experience to improve underwriting and claims decision making. Finally, we believe ROE is the ultimate measure of quality underwriting, execution on priorities, and prudent capital deployment. As such, we\u2019ll continue to focus on exceptional ROE performance. We will continue to deploy excess capital in a thoughtful manner, prioritizing shareholder return and investments in future growth. Results over several successive quarters affirm that this strategy is working. With our strong track record, we are confident in our ability to deliver core earnings ROE in the 14% to 15% range. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $588 million or $1.88 per diluted share. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $493 million. Our commercial book posted a very strong quarter and first half of 2023 with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3 and 88.4, respectively. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 11% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.7. The quarter included higher non-CAT property losses within our package product as compared to the prior year quarter. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the entire book evidenced by the 12th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio of below 90. Middle & Large Commercial delivered both a record for written premium of $1 billion and an underlying combined ratio of 88.7. This was a 4.2 point improvement from the prior year, including favorable non-CAT property losses and expense ratio improvement. Global Specialty\u2019s underwriting margin was a strong 85, a 1.9 point increase from a year ago, primarily due to slightly elevated losses in a runoff line with our international book and a higher expense ratio due to a business mix in Global Re and higher underwriting and technology costs. In Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was $57 million with an underlying combined ratio of 101.7. Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 79.6 was in line with expectations. Auto results reflected continued liability and physical damage severity pressure. The auto underlying combined ratio was an 111.8 for the quarter, which is 11.8 points higher than the prior year quarter, and is 5 points above a revised expectations from April and includes 3 points related to losses in the first quarter. This increase to our expectations is attributable primarily to a higher than anticipated number of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims. For auto liability, we recorded no net increase in prior year reserves as increases of about $60 million for accident year 2022 was offset by improvement primarily in accident years 2019 to 2021. As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the lost cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 6% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 13.8% and earned pricing increases of 8.5%. In homeowners, we achieved our highest written and earned pricing increases in over a decade of 14.4% written and 12.7% earned with the second quarter. The expense ratio decrease of 2.7 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spend. With respect to CAT, the industry experienced another quarter of elevated losses resulting in our Property & Casualty current accident year CAT losses of $226 million, which includes the impact from tornado, wind, and hail events across several regions of the United States. And while catastrophe losses were significantly elevated for the industry, our results were only slightly higher than expectations. Our effective aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher risk dates, helped limit our losses from confected [ph] storms in the quarter. Total net favorable P&C prior acting or development was $39 million with $38 million in Commercial Lines as reserve reductions in workers\u2019 compensation and catastrophes were partially offset by modest reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance and bond. In Group Benefits, core earnings in the second quarter were $133 million with a core earnings margin of 7.6%, reflecting strong premium growth and long-term disability results. The year-to-date margin of 6.4% is at the mid-point of our full year range of 6% to 7%. The group life loss ratio of 84.1% increased 5.5 points versus prior year. Approximately 4 points of that increase is due to favorable prior period reserve development recorded in second quarter 2022. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher severity in the current quarter. Group disability continues to deliver strong results with a loss ratio of 67% for the quarter. The expense ratio improves 70 basis points and reflects strong top line performance and expense reductions related to the Hartford Next initiative somewhat offset by the continued investment in new capabilities to meet our customer\u2019s evolving needs and drive greater efficiency. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $151 million contributed to a year-to-date sales total of $625 million. This combined with the excellent persistency Chris noted in his comments resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 7% per second quarter. The economy remains quite resilient with solid employment levels and wage growth both of which continue to have positive effects on the business. Our diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter, net investment income was $540 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4% before tax modestly higher than the first quarter. Our annualized limited partnership returns were 2.9% in the quarter. Results within the first half of 2023 were stronger than expected given the resiliency of private equity returns and we remain on track to achieve our expected full year 2023 target of 4% to 6%. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Given the interest in the real estate sector, we wanted to provide an update regarding that portion of our investment portfolio, which remains consistent with what we discussed in our first quarter earnings report. As we mentioned, less than 10% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is in office exposures, all of which we view to be top tier properties. During the quarter, two loans were fully repaid for approximately $90 million and manageable maturities are expected in the second half of 2023 and 2024. All loans remain current with respect to principal and interest payments with no delinquencies. CMBS holdings and credit quality are also largely unchanged given lower new issuance and limited trading activity. Our high quality non-agency CMBS portfolio is primarily conduit focused and has limited exposure to office loans. Holdings are supported by diversified underlying pools of property and have significant credit support to absorb individual loan losses with manageable near-term maturities. Turning to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $350 million. At the end of the quarter, we have $2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. Our second quarter results demonstrate that our franchise is well-positioned to deliver consistent, sustained, industry-leading results. We believe that we have the strategies, talent, and technology in place to continue to succeed. I will now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you, Beth. Operator, we have about 30 minutes for questions and we will take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi, good morning. First one I had is just on the comments you made on property growth earlier in the commentary and I was just interested in, how your catastrophe budget and what you\u2019d expect from CAT loss as a shift over the next year. Certainly, the CAT performance this quarter is quite good, so I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how that\u2019s shifting, if at all. Chris Swift : Yes. Alex, thanks for joining us. As we talked about improving and growing our property book and capabilities was paramount and I\u2019m pleased to report on a quarter-over-quarter basis, our property totals are up about 23% on a written premium basis. Pricing for the portfolio is up 15%, a couple standout data points there, large property is up almost 70%, with 18 points a rate, wholesale properties up 25% with 29 points a rate, and then our global reinsurance business is up about 50% of \u2013 with its property component and 30 points of rate. So you can see, I think we\u2019re executing well in an attractive marketplace and we feel good about what we\u2019re producing. I would just share with you that, we\u2019re not taking on consciously sort of CAT exposed property. I mean, we want broad-based property coverages, primarily the fire peril, and if it comes along with some incremental or limited CAT exposure, what will take it and price the CAT risk appropriately. So you should not think that this is a CAT play for us, but rather a broad-based property approach. And every year, we provide our CAT loads to you, we feel good about our CAT loads for this year, even with some slight elevation in the first half of the year. But that\u2019s what I would share with you, Alex. Alex Scott : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then in commercial on underline, anything you\u2019d call out in terms of like normalizing items. I mean, I guess pretty squarely in your range that you guided to, but just trying to think through where our baseline is and how the acceleration in pricing can benefit underlying from here. Chris Swift : Yes, I will share with you and sort of reprise what we talked about in the first quarter, but at a high level summary, nothing\u2019s really changed from what we\u2019ve talked about in the first quarter. We still feel good about the guidance that we put out, we\u2019re executing well. And remember, the fundamental thesis of the improvement between years was loss ratio improvement, expense ratio improvement. And we were going to fight some headwinds in our workers\u2019 comp business. So all three of those components are playing out almost exactly as we\u2019ve foreseen. There\u2019s also \u2013 remember, we talked about an earned premium impact that it was slightly more leveraged on the second half of the year. So earned premiums will continue to increase through the compounding effect of rates. So I still see that and expect that in the second half of the year. The second point we talked about was a mix more towards property and other lines that have just lower loss ratios that would mix in \u2013 to help improvement. And the third thing that, again, we see every month when we review results with the team. Our underwriting initiatives and how we\u2019re looking at terms and conditions in a thoughtful way continue to produce a loss ratio benefit. So you put all that together, it is still what we believe will emerge on a full year basis. To your specific point, Alex, on any unusual items in the quarter, I would say, there\u2019s probably five-tenths \u2013 excuse me, five-tenths of a point or a half a point in total headwinds, primarily from the non-CAT property losses that Beth talked about. We had favorability in middle, had some offsets in small, and then we have a runoff line of business aviation war in our international book. That business has been runoff in the last three quarters, but we did have $5 million of losses there. So I put those two pieces together and I would normalize a full half a point off of what we printed right now. Alex Scott : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Great. A question on workers\u2019 comp, a couple \u2013 it\u2019s been interesting hearing a couple competitors that also broker talk about seeing a bit of an inflection in healthcare inflation on the medical side. I\u2019m very cognizant and we are that \u2013 Hartford has a extremely strong franchise in comp, highly profitable line of business. But we just heard your comments too about kind of your confidence in margins, but just curious, if you are seeing anything there on the margins in terms of an uptick in medical inflation impacting, I guess it could be group benefits too. Thanks. Chris Swift : Yes. I would say, it\u2019s easier on group benefits, because we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not exposed to medical inflation there. Remember, our group benefits business we replace wages, and don\u2019t have any exposure to sort of medical cost in total. And then what I would say, Michael, on comp, obviously we have a lot of data points, we operate in all 50 states. But generally our medical severity trends are consistent with what we talked about in the first quarter and lower than the 5% that we assume in our pricing and reserving. I\u2019d say they\u2019re probably 50% lower at this point in time. Obviously, we\u2019re well aware of what\u2019s happening with broad based medical CPI, but we\u2019re somewhat insulated from that. And we\u2019ve talked about the reasons before, whether it be contracts on a state by state basis, our ability to challenge appropriate medical bills that are established to us. And remember, we \u2013 our biggest component of medical is usually physician visits and we\u2019re not paying for a lot of hospital stays and really big medical procedures. So it\u2019s behaving very well. But we do keep an eye out for it for any changes or adjustments we need to make. Mike Zaremski : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up just on lost cost trends on the \u2013 more on the commercial side, not on the personal line side. It\u2019s good to see there\u2019s been a some pricing momentum for Hartford as well, but just curious if loss costs are also inching higher and cognizant there\u2019s still probably a good delta between pricing above loss trend, but curious, we\u2019re continue to see a bit of reserved deficiencies for many in commercial auto and GL and I don\u2019t think Hartford\u2019s been fully immune to that. So curious, if lost cost trends also kind of maybe inching higher too. Chris Swift : Well, you\u2019re right to say that generally lost cost trends have had or our pricing has had a healthy margin above trends and that trend continues here into the second quarter. So we\u2019re pleased with the margin. And I would say for us, again, given our book of business, which is geared towards small and middle market enterprises. Our lost cost trends have been fairly consistent. So I don\u2019t see anything in aggregate, that is putting too much pressure on our trends at this point in time. So I would just say they\u2019ve been consistent, Michael. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Ward from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Ward : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just on non-CAT property in small and middle, was it \u2013 would you characterize that as a net benefit or net headwind for commercial lines in the quarter? Chris Swift : Yes. I would say, it was a net headwind. That\u2019s what I said about that 50 basis points or half a point of higher than expected property, non-CAT property losses and then if you put the aviation war losses that we booked in there and that\u2019s in the international vision, not small or middle. That\u2019s the 50 basis points of pressure I would normalize out. Mike Ward : Got it. Got it. Thank you. Maybe on personal auto, just curious \u2013 do you feel like the pricing that you\u2019ve gotten in the quarter, was it what you expected? Is there \u2013 is it more difficult with the regulatory environments or is it just severity is just higher than expected? Chris Swift : Well, where do we begin? Again, if I look at how we thought about how the year was going to play out is totally different honestly. I think the level of inflation pressure, the stickiness of it particularly in physical damage is just overwhelmed many industry participants. So then the BI component, the severity ticked up a little bit for us. We had a little bit more uninsured motorist claims this quarter. So it is just really been a challenge. What I would say on the positive side though is we\u2019re getting rate, teams pushing really hard for rate that we could just file and use or use and file in those states that we need to get pre-approval. We\u2019re working the system as hard as we can. Both Beth and I talked about the rate increases that we got in this quarter, and we expect to have a written rate increase of 20% by the end of the year. And I suspect once we plan for 2024 will probably be in that range of written rate need in 2024 to get the book \u2013 back to target profitability. But when we put it all together, it\u2019s overwhelmed our judgments and estimates, our judgments turned out to be too light. As we\u2019re halfway through the year and if you look at really what we printed on a six month basis, we\u2019re probably eight points above our guidance for the full year. And that\u2019s probably a minimum of where the full year\u2019s going to come out at this point in time. But again, the positive news I want to leave you with and the optimist side is we\u2019re executing well on our rate plans. We\u2019re really proactive with making the needed adjustments in a timely fashion. And that will continue into 2024 aggressively to get our book to target profitability probably in early 2025 now. Mike Ward : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. Good morning. Chris, maybe building off of that last comment, because that was going to be one of my questions on personal auto recognizing, right, that\u2019s obviously been a hard business line for everyone in the industry. So when you say you\u2019re going to get back, potentially back to target profitability in early 2025. Do you envision needing double-digit rates between now and then? Or how are you seeing price and severity trend playing out over the next year plus? Chris Swift : Yes, with respect to sort of our prior views, I\u2019m going to sort of hesitate to forecast too much just given how just dynamic things are at least. But what I would share with you two important points. We do expect in the fourth quarter written rate increases in the book about 20%. And again, an early view into 2024 from a written price side is probably in that general range and vicinity. We still see the stickiness in inflationary pressure on physical damage. And we\u2019re still cautious on what the BILLION, particularly the BI trends will be and then now the uninsured motorist trends, given where rates are most likely. So it\u2019s hard to predict. But as we sit here today, we think we need back to back years about 20 points of rate increases in 2023 and 2024 into the book to get us to a place to be in a position to have targeted profitability in early 2025. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks, Chris. And then within commercial lines, in response to Alex\u2019s question, right, you confirmed right that the year\u2019s kind of trending as expected. You did highlight, right, some unearned rate in the book. So is the right way to think about it that there could be a tailwind on the loss ratio just from that rate earning in, in the back half the year, especially if loss trend is stable, like you said? Chris Swift : Yes. Yes, I do believe the compounding effect of rate increases will increase. That\u2019s what our math shows particularly in the second half. So, yes, I think you\u2019ve got that right. Plus then the mix change and then the underwriting initiatives, and then we\u2019re still forecasting improved expense ratio in the second half of the year. So those are all the pieces, Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks so much and good morning. Chris, I\u2019m just trying to clarify, is the 0.5 point of non-cat weather, is that the consolidated or commercial loss ratio? Chris Swift : On commercial. Meyer Shields : Okay. What about on the personal side? Chris Swift : That wouldn\u2019t be a fair comparison to talk about commercial losses, how that impacts the personal lines. But I think you could do the math and add both pieces together if you\u2019re looking for a total P&C impact of those higher non-cat losses that you\u2019re looking for Meyer? Meyer Shields : Yes. Or just the personal lines impact. Beth Costello : Yes. I guess, what I would say is on personal lines, especially if you look at homeowners, as I said, where we came in was pretty much in line with expectations. So I wouldn\u2019t point to any unusual non-cat activity in that line. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Second question is also in personal lines. So expense ratio is actually doing well, and I was hoping you could just help us understand how much of that is reduced marketing and how much of it is incentive related? Chris Swift : So Meyer, you were breaking up a little bit on me. I heard a question regarding expense ratio and what\u2019s driving the expense ratio improvement. Meyer Shields : Yes, in personal lines. Chris Swift : In personal lines, yes, marketing. Meyer Shields : Perfect. Okay. Chris Swift : Mostly marketing. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. Chris, Beth and team, maybe we can go back to the success you\u2019ve been able to register in your commercial business from a new business production perspective. And I was struck by your comments around small business spectrums growth. I think you called out E&S binding as another area of strong growth. And I\u2019m curious about the effect of large numbers where incremental growth becomes more challenging. So how do you think about market conditions as you look not today and what you\u2019ve just reported, but you look going out into 2024? Do you feel like the customer strength is substantial enough that you can continue to put up these type of numbers? Or is there the potential that they could slow down if the economy sort of adds? Chris Swift : Yes. No, I would say, and I\u2019m going to ask Mo and Stephanie just to talk about what they feel in the market, market conditions and their ability to execute. But clearly, I believe through the end of this year and into 2024, I think will be a market environment that is still robust from a rate in terms and conditions perspective. I think particularly in the property area, broadly defined commercial property, homeowners property. And then if you look at some of the casualty lines, particularly commercial auto and some of the longer tailed liability lines, I think it\u2019ll be a conducive environment to grow and maintain or slightly expand margins going forward. So I\u2019m pretty bullish on the next 18 months, but Stephanie first and then Mo, what would you say? Stephanie Bush : Sure. And small commercial from a macro-economic perspective, we continue to see signs of a healthy economy, unemployment\u2019s low, new business starts and the small commercial space continue to be strong and still better than pre-pandemic levels. We still see strength in overall exposures. So we do not see any meaningful change more of the same. We\u2019re really pleased with the quality of our submissions and our submission flow. So I feel very positive in the quarter. We grew policies in force in every single line. And as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, our agents, our distribution really respond to our overall business model. And then finally, I would add in the E&S small commercial binding space, very, very pleased with our results. We continue to see this to be a growing and profitable part of our business. And we apply the same rigor and analytics to that book that we do to our admitted line, and we\u2019re really writing the business on our terms and price. So I\u2019m very pleased with our execution and our position in the market. Chris Swift : Mo? Mo Tooker : Greg, maybe I\u2019ll take the two pieces. So for middle and large commercial, I think submission activities up, so we feel good about that and then that continuing throughout the course of the year. And then what\u2019s exciting, I think is a lot of the capabilities we\u2019ve been putting into market over the past couple years are, we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to grow scale there. And Chris highlighted three in his script, talked about construction, energy, entertainment. So these are the verticals in middle and large commercial that we think on the back of that submission activity, we hope that the growth can continue through year end. And then similarly for global specialty, the growth is broad based and that gives me great confidence for our ability to maintain it. Chris Swift : And Greg last point, I do think the E&S market will continue to be a market that\u2019s attractive from a risk return perspective and ultimately a pricing side. So, again, I see the E&S market remaining healthy over the next 18 months. Greg Peters : Fair enough. That\u2019s good detail. I wanted to pivot for my second follow-up question to your comments around technology. You spoke about Generative AI, you spoke about the initiatives ongoing at the company. And then I\u2019m looking at the Hartford Next slide too. So I guess what I\u2019m curious about is just the view on technology spend inside the organization seems like there\u2019s always a lot more projects that you could spend money on, but you have to exercise some discipline. So can you talk to us about how you expect the budget for technology spend to evolve over the next 18 months or so? Chris Swift : Yes. I\u2019m happy to just give you high level commentary. Obviously, we will plan appropriately over the next three year on time horizon. But I would say, the Hartford Next program actually helped fund a lot of the investments that we continue to make today. So Beth, I would say, it\u2019s been a successful program. It\u2019s nearing its end. We do have a continuous improvement mind set. So there will always be opportunities to reduce expense and create greater efficiency, while continuing to invest thoughtfully in the next-generation of technologies. Broadly defined, Greg, I mean, we run sort of a constrained model. Everyone needs to compete for capital with appropriate IRs on their projects over a multi-year period. And that\u2019s generally how we do it. I think we\u2019ve shared with you, we do expect a significant structural savings over a longer period of time, particularly as we take all our data and applications to the cloud. We\u2019ll move about 100 apps to the cloud this year. Our Global Specialty business is completely in the cloud right now with all its business and data and apps. And that will generate meaningful savings. I would say probably Beth more 2025 and beyond because there is a little bit of an upfront invest. So yes, I\u2019m really proud of the team and how thoughtful they are on creating the business strategies and then the linkage to technology to create that differentiation for us in the marketplace. Greg Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Thanks. Hey, Chris. So one quick numbers question clarification on the commercial line side. Chris, I believe you said you think that the underlying margins and course lines should be stable or improve on a year-over-year basis and look through six months at about 60 basis points deterioration year-over-year. Do you still think that\u2019s achievable? Chris Swift : Greg, or excuse me, Brian. I\u2019m looking at a underlying combined ratio on a six-month basis of 88.4 compared to 88.2 last year. So I don\u2019t know where your math is, but that\u2019s 20 basis points. Brian Meredith : Look, I\u2019m talking about loss ratio. I\u2019m talking about loss ratio. Chris Swift : Oh, excuse me. Brian Meredith : Underlying loss ratio. Chris Swift : Sorry, I\u2019m putting the two together because as we just talked about, we are focused on expenses. So to not give us credit for it Brian, I think is just not proper. So I\u2019m putting the two together and yes, as I said in my opening comments, when I put the two together, I \u2013 we are going to have year-over-year improvement from 88.3 last year to somewhere below that on a full year basis. So that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. Brian Meredith : Perfect. Perfect. No, that\u2019s perfect. I appreciate that. Second question, just moving over to personal lines. I\u2019m just curious from a claims perspective and personal auto, is there anything that you\u2019re doing or can do to maybe help mitigate some of these inflationary trends that you\u2019re seeing or catch it quicker in data and analytics? And also on that, are you seeing any difference? I know it\u2019s really new, but any difference in the prevail experience versus your legacy book? Chris Swift : I will \u2013 I\u2019ll add some commentary and then maybe I\u2019ll ask Stephanie to add commentary. Brian, I would say we feel good about our data and analytics that we have deployed. But again, the inflationary pressures here is time to repair is wages in these repair shops. There\u2019s just a lot of pressure on the \u2013 I\u2019ll call it the economic system. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a backlog. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise or anything that is sort of unusual that you could sort of detect with trend lines. It\u2019s just more expensive to repair cars these days because they have more technology in them and there\u2019s been more severe accidents. It\u2019s driven by higher speed, and then you put the labor constraint onto it. So that\u2019s what I see. I think our claims team does a fine job, a good job. We got a network of claim specialists that we use that helps out our economics that if to stay in the network. So our customers and our claim handlers are incented to stay within there, but there\u2019s freedom of choice of where a customer would want to get their car repaired too. So that\u2019s what I would say, Stephanie, but what would you add? Stephanie Bush : I agree with your point on the claim from a prevailed perspective. A couple of additional points I would make, one, we\u2019re live in 22 states and we\u2019re going to roll out, we\u2019ve been rolling out additional four in the month of July. It\u2019s a small portion of our total book because as you know, it\u2019s new business. We are very pleased with the attributes and the quality of that business that we\u2019re writing. It is meeting our expectations. And then the third piece that I would share is as we move forward, as you know, we\u2019ve built that on a six-month auto chassis. And so our ability to continue to get rate and get it in at a bit faster clip is also assisting not only now in this environment, but over the longer term. So overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the business that we\u2019re writing. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Good morning. This is follow up on Mike\u2019s question on loss cost trends. Even though you\u2019re seeing stability on loss trends, what kind of margin you\u2019re building for stuff you\u2019re not seeing now, but maybe on the horizon, like you already spoke about seeing medical severity below your pricing reserving assumption. Any color and stuff like social inflation arise in latent liabilities and claims frequency reverting back it feels like it\u2019s down post pandemic. Chris Swift : Yes. Tracy, I\u2019m appreciate the question. Obviously, we pick a loss trend that contemplates a lot of the stuff that you talked about. So I can\u2019t break it down by product line for you. But just know that. When we pick trend, particularly by line of business, particularly within GL, it does contemplate a lot of the social aspects that you talked about litigation financing is always top of our mind in some of these areas. And then you look at particularly terms and conditions and things that we\u2019re just not going to be exposed to. The classic example is what we\u2019ve done with pollution over the years with asbestos how you exclude that on an absolute basis even the PFAS chemical these days. There\u2019s exclusions in our policies for those types of exposures again going forward. So again, I think our team is thoughtful from a risk side in trying to manage those long tail either mass tort exposures that you, I think you\u2019re referring to. Tracy Benguigui : I\u2019m curious, when did you put that PFAS exclusion in your policies? What year? Chris Swift : I would say four or five years ago. It\u2019s for those \u2013 Tracy, it\u2019s for those industries where we think we have the exposure, there might be implicit exposure there. We started in the beginning part of 2022. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Would you think that pollution exclusion in GL is broad based enough that it could include PFAS? Chris Swift : What I would say in PFAS is obviously it\u2019s nothing new. We\u2019ve been monitoring the exposures for many, many years. All the known exposure we have and discussion with our clients is included in our evaluation quarterly for reserving, and we make adjustments as we deem necessary. And also part of our A&E cover that we\u2019ve done with national indemnity, the pollution portion of PFAS, not the bodily injury portion, but the pollution portion is available to be seated to that cover. Tracy Benguigui : Awesome. Just a really quick numbers question. It looks like personal auto your [indiscernible] decline year-over-year sequentially that makes sense given all the price increases. Why then is your retention going up? Is that a timing difference or something else? Chris Swift : Yes. The honest answer is it\u2019s \u2013 obviously it\u2019s a calculation. Some of it could be influenced by our six-month policy trend versus 12 months. But I\u2019ll have Susan follow-up with you on the details of the calculation. Tracy Benguigui : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our last question will come from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. Chris, in your opening comments, you reiterated confidence in the 14% to 15% ROE. Obviously, we talked about the pressure we\u2019re seeing in personal auto, so it sounds like you do have some offsets or areas where you\u2019re \u2013 you think you\u2019ll be better than original guidance. I realize you don\u2019t really like talking or updating guidance over the course of the year. But would be curious as to where you are seeing \u2013 where you\u2019re more optimistic relative to your original targets? Chris Swift : Well, Yaron, what I would say is, there\u2019s a lot of good things that are happening across the platform. Two of our biggest lines are performing well and probably better than we expected workers\u2019 comp and disability. If I look at our investment portfolio, as far as yield maybe slightly above where we planned. I think that\u2019ll contribute. I think there will be a normalization of our non-CAT property losses that we talked about. We\u2019re out of the aviation war business, so that tail should be less impactful. So I put those components to there. And even with the ongoing pressures which I admit are continuing longer than we thought in personal lines. Personal lines is still a relatively small business and its overall contribution to ROE will be muted by it\u2019s just by its size. So we continue to buy in shares, that we find attractive from a valuation side. So those are the component pieces I would share with you Yaron. Yaron Kinar : Okay. I appreciate it. And I would just note that I think the two larger businesses as of today, at least first half of the year, seem to be tracking in line with full year guidance. So I guess it would suggest further improvement or maybe in some cases even significant further improvement from here? Chris Swift : I\u2019m going to resist talking about the future much more than I typically would. Yaron Kinar : Fair enough. And then maybe a quick one for Beth. I think new money rates have actually been coming down the last two quarters if I look at Slide 13 of the presentation, can you maybe talk about that? Beth Costello : Sure. I think it\u2019s kind of mixed, as you said, it\u2019s been coming down from December. And one thing I would just point out is that when you think about our investment from portfolio. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve not made any significant changes in how we think about asset allocation and so forth. But in any given quarter what we\u2019re purchasing can change a bit. So if we look at where we are in second quarter versus first quarter and fourth quarter a little bit lower in duration, a little bit higher in credit quality. So that mix can sometimes have an impact on how you just look at the sequential. What we\u2019re really pleased about is the differential between our reinvestment rate and the sales and maturity yield still very healthy, and that contributing overall to the improvement that we\u2019ve seen in the fixed maturity yield. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. I appreciate the answers. Operator : We\u2019re out of time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Susan Spivak Bernstein for closing remarks. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Chris Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The Hartford's third quarter financial and operational performance builds upon the momentum achieved in the first half of the year. Once again, Commercial Lines and Group benefits, which in aggregate represent over 85% of earned premium delivered exceptional results. We continue to expand our strong competitive position, successfully executing on priorities and delivering superior returns for shareholders. Let me now call your attention to highlights from the third quarter. Top-line growth in Commercial Lines of 8% with an underlying combined ratio of 87.8. Strong pricing across P&C including double digit increases in Commercial Property, Personal Lines, Auto and Home. Group benefits fully insured premium growth of 8% with a core earnings margin of 9.8%. Strong investment performance with reinvestment rates, climbing to 6%, driving higher portfolio yield and the trailing 12-month core earnings are already of 14.9%. These results are outstanding and keep us on track to deliver a full year core earnings ROE in the range of 14% to 15%.  As I look across the markets, the U.S. economy has remained resilient in recent data points, including robust payroll, strong retail sales, in solid levels of industrial production point to an environment, which continues to be supportive of the Hartford's businesses.  Now let me dive deeper into the third quarter performance by business. In Small Commercial, written premiums were $1.2 billion with 16% growth in new business and another sub-90 underlying margin. Our best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace, contributing new business premium of approximately $100 million, up 20% over the prior year. In addition, written premium for excess and surplus lines grew 34% in the quarter with new business growth of over 50%. We expect E&S premium to approach $200 million for the full year.  I am incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial, which continues to deliver outstanding results with industry leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy. This business is poised to exceed $5 billion have written premium this year. Middle & Large Commercial had another great quarter Written premiums grew 5% reflecting strong rate execution and new business growth in our excess lines. Our general industries properties book grew 13% while large property grew 15%.  Looking across Commercial Lines, we are taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to grow property premium within favorable market conditions to the level of approaching $2.5 billion for the full year or a 25% increase. We are focused on managing our CAT exposure, as evidenced by our year to date CAT losses, which were lower than our market share.  Coming back to Middle & Large Commercial, underlying margins were exceptional, reflecting the advancements made in data science capabilities, pricing, and underwriting tools. Margin has also benefited from favorable property losses. Those advancements combined with our best-in-class talent position as well to sustain profitable growth in this business.  Global Specialty continues to deliver outstanding results with net written premiums up 11% driven by new business growth and strong renewal written pricing in a number of key lines. Submission flow in the U.S. was up 11% in the quarter, including 15% growth in wholesale and international saw strong new business growth in marine and Energy. Within renewal written pricing, momentum has been building in the wholesale access market. Property pricing has been above 20% all year, and international casualty is above 10%. In addition, we remain excited about the ongoing benefits to the top-line from our expansive product portfolio. Our underwriting discipline, along with enhanced capabilities, developed over the past few years in Global Specialty are driving targeted market share gains with a stellar underlying combined ratio that has hovered in the mid-80s for the past six quarters. In short, our execution has never been stronger. Turning to pricing, Commercial Lines' renewal written pricing was 5.4% flat with the second quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing rose to 8% up four tenths sequentially with strong pricing in Property, Auto and General Liability. Across Commercial property pricing is over 10% with Auto and General Liability nearing that level as well. Pricing and other liability and casualty lines also remained strong, while public D&O is still pressured. In workers' compensation, renewal written pricing continues to exceed expectations, remaining slightly positive in the quarter. All in ex-comp renewable written pricing and Commercial Lines remains on top of last cost trends, reinforcing my confidence and achieving our margin expectations for the year. In summary, momentum persist in commercial lines, where I expect top-line growth and highly profitable margins to continue.  Moving to Personal Lines, I am pleased with our continued response to elevated loss cost in both Auto and Home. In this challenging environment, our focus, objectives and execution are unwavering. During the quarter, we achieved auto renewal written price increases of nearly 20%, which we expect to continue at that rate into the fourth quarter. Current accident year lost trend expectations for the third quarter, as updated in June, held a promising development as we finished the year.  In Homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.1% comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit pricing increases in this book. Our focus on the preferred market within Personal Lines business is a competitive advantage with our modern, innovative and digitally enhanced offering prevail.  This product will be available in 39 states by the end of this month. And we are optimistic about future prospects for growth. In the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve Auto new business rate adequacy in over half the states representing two thirds of new business premium. I am confident in the pricing actions we are taking will return this business to targeted profitability in 2025.  In Group Benefits, premium growth of 8% and a quarter earnings margin of 9.8% were both outstanding. Core earnings of $170 million was a quarterly record, reflecting focused execution, improved mortality trends, and continued strong disability results. This quarter's disability loss ratio reflects historically low, long-term disability incidents, trends, and favorable claim recoveries.  In Group Life, mortality trends have improved both sequentially in year-over-year, but remain above pre-pandemic levels. Looking at the top-line, growth was driven by book persistency above 90%, plus strong year to date sales. Overall, the strength of our Group Benefits, diversified product portfolio, as well as our commitment to outstanding customer experience through the use of data and technology resonates in this marketplace, cementing our leadership position.  Before I turn the call over to Beth, let me share some takeaways from the recent Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers Annual Conference. Throughout the course of the 60-plus meetings in touchpoints at CIAB, we heard a consistent acknowledgement of the strength of our franchise. Partners called out our unique digital tools, broad product set, the strength of our innovation agenda, and the consistent execution of our strategy over a number of years. They also expressed their desire to grow their business with us, and they have come to view our team as best-in-class with relationships that have never been stronger. Confirmation from distribution partners that we are delivering on our strategy is strong validation of our leading position in the market.  Through those relationships combined with enhanced capabilities, state-of-the-art technology and digital tools we are taking market share while delivering industry-leading returns. With that track record, I am confident in our ability to consistently deliver core earnings ROEs in the 14% to 15% range.  Now, I'll turn the call over the best to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $708 million, or $2.29 per diluted share. Commercial Lines had a very strong quarter with core earnings of $542 million, and an underlying combined ratio of 87.8. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 9% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.7, which includes some elevated non-CAT property losses. This is the 13th consecutive quarter with an underlying combined ratio of below 90.  Middle & Large commercial delivered another quarter of written premium over $1 billion and an exceptional underlying combined ratio of 88.1. This was a 5.6 point improvement from the prior year, including favorable non-CAT property losses and expense ratio improvement.  Global Specialty's underlying margin with a strong at 4.3, a 20 basis point improvement from a year ago, primarily due to lower loss ratios in Global Reinsurance and International Lines partially offset by higher loss ratios in U.S. financial lines due to public D&O rate pressure, and marine driven by a couple of large losses, as well as higher policyholder dividends in bonds due to the strong profitability of the book.  In Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was $8 million with an underlying combined ratio of 99. Homeowners' underlying combined ratio of 78.1 was in line with expectations. The Auto underlying combined ratio was one 108.5 for the quarter, which is consistent with our expectation from second quarter. Importantly, we made no adjustments to loss picks from the first half of the year and prior accident years. As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the loss cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 8% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In Auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 19.7% and earned pricing increases of 11.7%. In Homeowners, pricing increases of 14.1% on a written basis and 13.7% unearned. The expense ratio improved by 2.9 points, primarily driven by lower marketing spend. With respect to CAT, P&C current accident year catastrophe were $184 million before tax, which compares to catastrophe losses of $293 million in the prior year quarter, which included Hurricane Ian losses of $214 million. Although CAT losses were elevated for the industry again this quarter, our results were in line with our expectations as we believe that our effective aggregation management and underwriting discipline has helped to limit our losses from the increased number of convective storms. Total net favorable prior accident year development was $43 million, with $46 million in Commercial Lines as reserve reductions in workers' compensation and package businesses were modestly offset by reserve increases in general liability. Moving to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the third quarter were $170 million with a core earnings margin of 9.8%, reflecting strong premium growth and long-term disability results. Group disability continues to deliver strong results with a loss ratio of 67.3% for the quarter down 1.1 points from prior year. The Group Life loss ratio of 80.2% improved 2.9 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. The expense ratio improved 1.4 points and reflects strong top-line performance and expense efficiencies, somewhat offset by continued investments to meet our customers' evolving needs and drive greater efficiency. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $143 million contributed to a year-to-date sales total of $768 million. This, combined with excellent persistency at above 90%, resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 8% for the third quarter. Our diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter, net investment income was $597 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates, and we continue to be pleased with the positive 150 basis point differential between our reinvestment rate and the yield on sales and maturities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.1% before tax, slightly higher than the second quarter. We expect the full yield excluding LPs will be about 80 basis points higher than the prior year. Looking forward to 2024, we anticipate another 25 basis points of improvement based on the current yield curve, which will contribute to about a $200 million before tax increase in investment income excluding LPs. Our annualized LP returns were 6.3% in the quarter. Results during the first nine months of 2023 reflect the resiliency of our private equity return and the absence of any real estate equity sales.  The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A plus. This maturity valuation decreased as a result of higher interest rates. Net credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments remain insignificant, along with an increase of $5 million in the allowance for credit losses on the mortgage loan portfolio. All of our mortgage loans continue to be current with respect to interest and principal payments. Turning to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the fourth quarter. We were also pleased to announce yesterday an 11% increase in our common quarterly dividend payable on January 3. This is the tenth increase in the dividend in the last decade and another proof point of the consistent capital generation of the company. Our third quarter results demonstrate that our franchise continues to deliver consistent, sustained industry-leading results. We believe that we have the strategies, talent and technology in place to continue to succeed.  I will now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, we will now take our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Hey, good morning. Chris and Beth, a couple of questions here. First one, I just want to dig in a little bit on the Commercial Lines premium growth. I was a little surprised at the slowdown that we saw in the Middle Market's premium growth considering which some other companies have been reporting this quarter.  And then the Small Commercial side, I know you had a difficult comp there but also a slowdown. Maybe we can unpack it a little bit, and anything unusual going on? Chris Swift : Brian, thanks for the question. I think just the context here, just if you look at sort of year-to-date results just on written premium in small, up 10.3%; middle, 8.8%. New sales in small, 21%; middle, 12%. So those are results we're really proud of and pleased with, particularly at the profitable margins that they're producing. I would say in the second quarter, there's two main themes that we discussed as a management team, and I'll let Mo add his color, is we're remaining disciplined on price and underwriting. And if we're not going to get the terms and conditions that we expect, we'll let the business go. And I think that happened more times than not in the -- particularly in the July time period.  And then I would say that the overall exposure growth is still positive, but it is moderating, evidenced by lower audit premiums on a sequential first half of the year basis. So again, still positive exposure growth, but not as robust as it was early in the year. But Mo, what would you add? Mo Tooker : Yeah, Brian, I would say that just to reiterate, we feel really good about the year-to-date growth of the 12% on new. But as you see in the quarters, can be lumpy. And maybe a little bit of context there. We equip our underwriters with tools by product, by specialty area and then they are in the market executing on those. And sometimes, in some quarters we do -- and especially periodically see months where the market is just going further than we would go.  So I feel like our underwriters made really good decisions in the quarter and you especially see those months at the beginning of the quarter when the market really heats up a little bit periodically. But broadly, I think the underwriting team did a nice job. And right now, these months are more of an exception, but we're watching that closely. Brian Meredith : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Chris, second question. I know we've chatted about this before on conference calls, but a fairly large TPA out there talked about medical cost inflation and workers' comp of 7% to 9% is what they're seeing in their business right now. Is that what you're seeing? I don't believe that was the case. And how would that kind of play into your comp results? Chris Swift : Yeah. Happy to sort of comment on that, but there's a -- not going to be anything new I'm going to share with you. I think again in the context that our workers' comp is a highly profitable line of business. We haven't made any changes in frequency or medical assumptions since we set them at the beginning of this year. So things are actually running almost exactly as we predicted.  Medical severity, as we've talked about it, what we price for and collect and put up on the balance sheet is 5%. Actually, what's emerging for the first nine months is slightly less than that in the 2% to 3% range. I would say though that if I look at trends last year, nine months, this year, nine months, medical severity is probably up a little bit, say, a point. But I don't think there's any trend to call out other than just sort of maybe normal volatility.  We watch all our components of price, whether it be hospital stays, whether it be physicians, whether it pharmaceuticals. And generally, things are behaving as we expect. So I don't know what to tell you other than it's steady as she goes from our perspective as we sit here today. I think the impact on the longer term is still to play out. But as we've talked about before, Brian, I mean, our claims team is world-class. We have fee schedules in place, networks in place that sort of provide a buffer. And if long-term, things continue to be elevated, the reaction function within our system, I think, will allow us to raise prices and deal with it appropriately.  So I don't think we're going to get surprised in any way, shape or form on medical severity running away from us. Brian Meredith : And I would expect your loss control probably helps you relative to the industry as well, right? Chris Swift : Yeah. Clearly, we've got a lot of capabilities embedded in claims, embedded in our Engineering Group, so yes. And again, being the second largest rider, you would expect us to have those capabilities. Brian Meredith : Yeah, thank you. Very helpful. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted first to start with the response to Brian's first question. You guys said that you just saw some competitive forces in July. And it sounds like that corrected over the rest of the quarter. I want to confirm that.  But then can you give us a sense of what lines, I guess, specifically within the middle market you were seeing folks become more competitive in July? Chris Swift : Elyse, I might have Mo comment on that. Mo Tooker : Yeah, Elyse, I would just say that July was the month we felt it the most. And then it was on the larger end. I won't get into specific areas. I'll just the larger account segment is really where we felt the most competition during the month. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then with the reserve development in the quarter, we saw total favorable development was driven by comp. There was a little bit of adverse development in GL. Anything you want to highlight there? Any specific years or anything you guys are seeing? I know it's a small number, but just looking for some color there. Beth Costello : Yeah, Elyse, it's Beth. Nothing in particular I'd call out. A couple of large losses that we saw on umbrella and one large national account that's spread over several years. So again, as you pointed out, relatively small impact in the quarter and nothing that's indicative of a new trend or anything like that. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open. Mike Ward : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering just with the growth in property, how should we think about your non-CAT property volatility going forward? And like has the range of outcomes on your underlying loss ratio, why didn't it change materially? Chris Swift : Mike, thanks for the question. As I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we're trending towards $2.5 billion of commercial property premium across our businesses, which would be about a 25% increase from prior year. And we feel very good about how we're executing both from a growth and pricing side.  I'll give you just a couple of numbers for the third quarter here. In our Spectrum property component. Our growth was 13%, and pricing 11.5%, up. In our general property in Middle Market, growth was 13% and pricing was up 12.9%. Large property grew 16% with pricing up 16% also. So I think, in total, we're executing very well. We grew property 12% this quarter with pricing up 14%. And as I said before, I mean, this isn't a CAT strategy. I mean, we'll obviously take on a little CAT, but we're looking at other perils, particularly the fire, to build a national book of more property exposure. And I think we're getting paid for that incremental volatility from quarter-to-quarter. I would say the story line this quarter, particularly with non-CAT commercial property losses were, in total, at expectations and about a point better than prior year with elevated losses in small commercial, offset by lower losses expected in Middle & Large. So I think our strategy as well. And Mo, I don't know if you would add anything as far as the execution or any color from the marketplace, please. Mo Tooker : Yeah. We just continue to build a talent base. We're attracting people just based on how we're going about going after property. The tool set continues to improve. And we're talking retail and wholesale here. We continue to see an opportunity, rates generally hanging in there. Terms and conditions are hanging in their deductibles are improving. So I think broadly, we feel really optimistic about our ability to continue to chase the market. Chris Swift : Stephanie, what would you add in Small Commercial property and any E&S color? Stephanie Bush : Yeah. I think you framed it well from the Spectrum perspective, is that we experienced some volatility. But as you referenced, we've taken rate not just recently, over many years, to stay at or ahead of loss trend for the property portion of our above [ph] product.  And as Chris stated, it's double digits in terms of what we accomplished in the third quarter, which is higher than our longer-term property trends. And I will remind everybody that we did have our 13th quarter in a row with an underlying combined in the under 90%. From an E&S perspective, E&S binding, which continues to be a growing and profitable portion of our book of business, strong risk selection, achievement of 30 points of property rate in the quarter and growing. So all in, really proud of how -- the team's execution. Mike Ward : Awesome. Maybe on Personal Lines real quick and the seasonality. Just wondering, should we expect the typical pressure in 4Q? Or do you think the rate that you're pushing can actually maybe mute that seasonality? Beth Costello : Yeah. So I'll take that, and this is Beth. In Personal Lines and if we break it out between auto and home, in auto we'd expect fourth quarter to be higher than what we've seen year-to-date and probably in that sort of 6 to 8 point range. Where it comes out will really be impacted by just where loss trend goes.  On the other hand, home, typically, fourth quarter is more favorable than the year-to-date usually by 5 to 6 points. And we'd be expecting that again this quarter. Mike Ward : Thanks, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi, good morning. First one I had is just a follow-up on the workers' comp. I hear you on how you feel about the profitability of the business, and certainly, the reserve development has been great. I guess just helping us think through the NCCI sort of indications are pointing down another mid-single digits. And you mentioned, I think, the 5% loss cost trend.  So how should we think about the margin drag that, that creates going into next year? I mean, can you help us think through -- like even just relative to the headwind that you got from that this year, does it get worse? I mean, there's also a sort of a moving target in terms of the baseline that you sort of start off with when you do that math. So I just -- any help would be great. Chris Swift : Alex, I hate to disappoint you but we're not going to talk about next year at this point. We'll talk about next year once we finish this year and what we see. But you're right, I mean, there is going to be continued pressure coming from pricing. But I think the setup is going to be very similar to this year.  As much as there's pricing pressure, frequencies will, I believe, continue to improve. We'll pick our same medical severity most likely in that 5% range but knowing that it's performing better. We've been able to out-execute on our rate plan this year, which is providing a modest benefit. So there's always the opportunities to outperform a rate plan in spite of what the NCC is putting out.  And again, you still put all the math and the mechanics together, it's still going to be a profitable line of business for us in the industry. And I think it's very manageable from our point of view, at least heading into 2024. Alex Scott : Got it. Second question I had for you is just on the ROE range you all talk about. I mean, you're sort of hitting the upper end of it right now. And Personal Lines isn't making money right now, and with the rate you're taking, it should start to again. And then investment income, you talked about being a bigger contributor next year. So when I think through all that, I hear the ROE guide and I'm sure -- look, you're not going to adjust your long-term targets. It's going to be periods that you're earning more or less than the target potentially. But is that the right way to think about it that, that is a longer-term ROE guide and that you're not suggesting that there's some offset to those things necessarily and that we may go through a period where you're over the top end of it? Chris Swift : I think you got it right. We've said about our franchise, we're becoming more consistent, more predictable in all our businesses, whether it be Property & Casualty, whether it be group benefits. Personal Lines is going through a tough slog, but we do see a return to profitability in 2025 there. So yeah, the range is the range. We've added the word consistently to that range. It's not a limit. We'll try to overachieve and outperform that. But I think that is -- that 15 is particularly a good anchor point, plus or minus. And we're going to always try hard to outperform and do our very best. We are sensitive just to a little bit of rate fatigue that may or may not be happening in the marketplace with customers and agents and brokers. I think we've educated people well enough over the years, Alex, at least from our perspective, on the components of loss cost trends and why we need to continue to be disciplined with rate, whether it be commercial auto, whether it be property, whether it be GL, with all the factors that have been discussed by many over a long period of time. So I think that still puts the industry in a conducive place, particularly as we head into 2024 with particularly a rising yield environment and investment returns coming through the portfolio.  So yeah, you put it all together, and I still think that's a good range, but it's not a limit for us to try to outperform. Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning. I'm going to pivot to the Group Benefits business. If I look at Page 21 of your supplement, a nice step-up in ROE over the last several quarters. Can you remind us of what kind of economic sensitivity that business has? Because there's obviously some noise in the marketplace about what the economy might look like next year. And then secondly, when I look at the results in -- particularly in the third quarter, wondering if there's anything you want to call out, unusual good guys that helped that boost the number higher. Thanks. Chris Swift : Greg, I'll start and then I'll ask Jonathan to add his commentary. Yeah, you're right to point out the 13.8% ROE. Very proud of that. Obviously, mortality is trending back to normal, which is providing a tailwind.  I would say, though, mortality on a year-to-date basis is still maybe slightly ahead of our expectations but again trending in the right way. And we've talked about it for a while that we're trying to put additional rate into that life insurance book. And the team, I think, is executing well in the marketplace. The other thing I just always like to convert is that 13.8 GAAP ROE probably translates into a 17% tangible ROE on a tangible basis just given some of the goodwill that we've added with acquisitions over the years. So on a tangible basis, it is a meaningful contributor. Earnings power is getting back to what I think would be somewhat normal. The investment performance will contribute. So I think it's a stellar business for us. It's one of the industry leaders. It's growing nicely in conjunction generally with economic conditions, whether it be employment, payroll gains. The disability claims function that we have is, I think, world class. We've added new capabilities with our voluntary product suite and the number of paid family leave components. I could go on and on because I think it's a valuable business that people should look at maybe a little differently than it's valued today. But Jonathan, what would you add from an overall performance side and a trend? Jonathan Bennett : That is a terrific overview, Chris. So a lot of agreement with all of that. I think, Greg, you asked a bit about some of the economic drivers, and that often gets ascribed to the LTD line linked with employment levels. Obviously, right now, unemployment at very low levels. Certainly, that is contributing, we think, to some of the performance of the business. The outlook right now around unemployment, not something that we see as being a real negative drag into the future. Even if levels were to increase, there's always a bit of a delay between when we see that and if there is going to be any effect on LTD. But even that effect, we would say, is pretty loose in terms of its linkage. It's not a hard connection. And we think that even if unemployment levels were to increase moderately, we're probably still operating at attractive levels. So things seem to be in good shape on the LTD side. Your other point about in the third quarter, as Chris outlined, solid net investment income, pleased with that result. The mortality is probably one of the more notable things for us. We've had sequential improvement over the last four quarters, that's been terrific on mortality. But this quarter, we got down to a level that we think of as being more in line with endemic state post pandemic. And so we're pleased to see that. We'll watch that one again in the fourth quarter, but that bodes well for the business moving forward. And then on the disability side LTD, again, incidence levels pretty attractive at this moment and our claims team is doing a phenomenal job around recovery. So we think our expertise there is really coming through. One of the things about The Hartford is we understand medical management whether that's comp or LTD, and we think that comes through in our execution on both sides of the organization. So really pleased with that outcome. Where that trends in the future, I think we'll continue to monitor and obviously adapt ourselves quickly as necessary, but we're pretty pleased with the performance of the business year-to-date. Greg Peters : That makes sense. Thanks for the detail on that. I guess as my follow-up, I'll pivot to the Personal Lines business. And what I was interested in is that if I look at your prior accident year development table, where we're seeing other companies report adverse development inside Personal Lines, we're not really seeing it at The Hartford. So maybe you could spend a minute and just talk to us about why your trends are maybe a little bit different from some of the others that are reporting problems in terms of reserve development, that is? Beth Costello : Yeah. So I'll start. So first of all, in Q3, as we said in our remarks, we did not make any adjustments to prior accident years for the auto line, for auto liability or auto physical damage. If you -- I'll remind you, if you go back to the first half of the year, in the first quarter, we did record about $20 million related to physical damage for the 2022 year. And also, in the first quarter and second quarter, we increased our estimates for auto liability for the 2022 year, but those were offset by releases for years '21 and prior. So that's why that development on a net basis is not showing up in that table.  So we were experiencing some of the same trends that others were seeing. We reacted to them. As I said, we are very pleased that in the third quarter, our loss picks for prior accident years as well as the first half of the year did remain unchanged.  And the last thing that I'll just point out on that, because I know some have looked at sort of our year-over-year results in auto. And I'll just remind you that because we have booked prior year development for the '22 year in '23, when you look at that third quarter reported underlying loss ratio for auto, it would probably be about 4 to 5 points higher reflecting some of that PYD we've seen. So hopefully, that helps some people who are looking at sort of that year-over-year comparison in the underlying auto ratio. Greg Peters : Thank you very much for that detail. Operator : And we will take our next question from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yeah, thank you very much. I'm looking at all this auto stuff. One thing that was a big change in your is the GEICO really improved a lot in their margins and, at the same time, they churned a significant portion of their book of business. One of the things that you're looking for to improve profitability long term in the AARP business was the opportunity to non-renew customers who shouldn't renew.  To what extent do you think there's a solution in your profitability, a combination of non-renewing customers as opposed to achieving through rate alone? Chris Swift : Josh, it's Chris. I'll start and then I'll ask Stephanie to add her color. Again, we're very proud of the AARP relationship for over the last 35 years. I think you will recall, we did renew a contract and extended it to 2033. Part of that then, we launched the Prevail product and platform. But the in-force business, both auto and home, it does have lifetime continuity agreements still on, on the policy that prohibits us from just canceling a customer unless their risk profile, particularly in the homeowners' line, really changed. That's different with Prevail, but that's going to take some time to sort of work its way all into the in-force business. Because 90% of the business that we still have on the books, it relates to lifetime continuity agreements. So we have to be sensitive there. That's why we're pushing for rate as aggressively as we've had. And I think Stephanie and the team, the numbers and the results speak for themselves, and that will begin to earn in.  But Stephanie, what would you add? Stephanie Bush : No, I think you framed it really well, Chris. When you think about really where our focus, Josh, is, it's responding to the loss trend environment. You see that materializing in our rate actions. We're also deploying our Prevail products, 39 states and market as of today. About 50% of our new written premium is on the Prevail product but that is a very small portion of our in force. So just to go back to underscore, Chris' comment on the overall in-force, and share of that does have the lifetime continuation endorsement and then the preponderance of our in-force book being 12-month policies takes time for that rate to earn in. But wholly focused on bringing this book back to profitability. Josh Shanker : And when we look at that new business, is the rate increase is similar between what's going through on the Prevail book and what's going on in the lifetime continuity book? Stephanie Bush : Yeah, absolutely. What I would share with you is that on the in-force book, you see the written rate. The rate has to earn in. But as we've shared in previous calls, we also look at new business rate adequacy. So when -- what is the rate level of new business? And we expect, based on all of our actions that more than half of our states by this year, by year-end, will be new business rate adequate. And that makes up about 65% of our new business volume. And so again, that gives us a degree of confidence in terms of continuing to market to drive in new.  So you have to think about new business being rate adequate given all of our rate actions. And then on the in-force, that book is going to earn in that rate overtime. Josh Shanker : Thank you for the details. Appreciate it. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Jack on for Mike. Just one question on the commercial insurance competitive environment. Excluding workers' comp, are you surprised at all that commercial pricing has continued to increase? Any thoughts on how we should think about pricing into 2024 once higher reinsurance costs are through the system? And we're seeing some declines in certain core CPI gauges. Chris Swift : Hey, Jack, thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll have Mo add. No, I don't think there's any surprise. I thought I tried to address it that just given the environment, I think the continuation of rate being disciplined reinsurance costs are probably increasing. All point need to be disciplined on rate and work with our distribution partners and customers to make sure they understand why, so that there can be an element of explanation back to the end customer. So I see more of the same as we head into '24 at this point in time. But Mo, what would you add on the commercial side? Mo Tooker : Yeah. No, I would say that the reinsurance market feels fairly stable, fairly predictable. So I think that's getting priced in ahead of renewal dates. I would say, second, the rate environment is still pretty conducive. We think it's constructive and we think that will continue.  And then third, again, I talked before about we have months periodically where we just think the market is competitive. It just is lumpy that way. And oddly right now, October is feeling really good. And so just things bounce around a little bit, and that's just -- we're going to be really disciplined about it, but we're looking to grow in a really responsible fashion. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. There is a big debate on what is the best definition of pricing. Is it pure rate or exposure to act like rate? Your 19.7% pricing increase for personal auto is a great achievement. I'm not really hearing that pricing level from your peers. So just to get grounded, are you including exposure in there? And if you are, how does auto exposure act like rate? Chris Swift : Tracy, I would add some commentary and then ask Stephanie. But my commentary is going to be more on commercial just so you have that. It's somewhat unique in Personal Lines auto, home. Home, we talk about the rate that we're achieving both includes pure rate and ITV, which we think works in tandem. But I think we disclosed -- I know I talked about it in my prepared remarks, ex comp, our renewal written pricing was 8% in the quarter, up four tenth.  And I would say the component of exposure that acts like rate there, yes, I think you could think of it as basically 2.5 points, 2.6 points to be precise for one third exposure and then two third sort of net rate.  That's on commercial. And I would ask Stephanie to explain to you the auto. Stephanie Bush : Hi, Tracy. I think about personal auto is largely the rate, and I appreciate your comments. Really, our results that we were able to realize, and from a rate perspective, is largely driven by the loss results are evident and they're fully supportable in our filings. We have strong relationships with the regulators and then it was just truly outstanding execution by the team. But if I take you over to homeowners, how Chris described it that is a combination of both rate and then what we're seeing in terms of the inflationary factors. And you bring those two together, and that gave us the 14.1. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Yeah, it was more on personal auto. I appreciate that. In Group Benefits, specifically to stability, could you see yourself being more competitive on pricing at one-one renewals, given what you said historically low long-term disability incidence trends and favorable claims recovery? Chris Swift : I'm going to have Jonathan add his commentary, but the market is pretty competitive and pretty efficient. So I don't think we have to make a conscious decision to be more competitive on price. We have our targets. Obviously, we'll reflect new disability trends, both incidents and terminations for that cohort. We do expect a reversion to the mean there, Tracy. So that will put some upward pressure on pricing just from where we are today.  But I wouldn't say there's a conscious mindset at 1/1/24 to do anything different than we've been doing in the past. But Jonathan, what would you say? Jonathan Bennett : I would agree with that, Chris. I think that's the outlook that we bring to the market. We can talk about when we look forward into 2024, we find the market to be competitive all the time. I don't feel as though there's any particular change in the nature of competition in the market. And for us, a fair portion of our book is upmarket, larger accounts, and there's credibility in the data often by account there. And so we're looking at those trends on an account-specific basis and have been doing that, continue to do that. That's the way we compete in the marketplace. And so I think that we factor all of this insight into those selections. So I don't think there's any particular change. And if the underlying question is, is this a moment of drop pricing and to grow aggressively? That's not the outlook The Hartford brings really in any of its lines of business. So the discipline is there. It remains there. And our efforts are to continue to grow the book profitably and to make sure that we take care of our clients in a world-class fashion. Tracy Benguigui : And you did mention reversion of the mean. If you had a crystal ball, when will you see that happening? Chris Swift : We'll tell you when we get there, Tracy. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Chris Swift : I mean, we price for a reversion. Obviously, we hope it's somewhat different given just the economic conditions. But I don't know when the realized reversion to the mean will actually happen, but we got to be prepared for it. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Jonathan Bennett : Yeah. I think that's a fair summary, Chris. And our pricing methodology includes a multiyear view of trend. And I think in that, Chris, as we're thinking about it, we see that incidence levels are likely to be increasing overtime. But I think that horizon is always something that we're working on and debating here ourselves and thinking about the right way to position ourselves in the market from a pricing standpoint. Operator : And we will take our final question from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. I want to go back to some of the reserve commentary earlier on the call. Can you maybe talk a little more about accident years '16 through '19? I think a lot of investors are honed in on those years specifically, and what you're seeing there for lines like GL and like maybe financial lines as well. Beth Costello : Yeah. I mean, as it relates to the quarter, as I said, with a very small amount of relative increases. I think if you go back and look at over the last several quarters, you've seen us take some increases in GL lines. And I'd say a lot of that has been in those years that you are indicating. And we take that experience into consideration as we think about our loss picks and pricing for those lines going forward. So I don't really have much more color to add to that, Yaron, unless there's something else specific you were looking at. Yaron Kinar : I guess, and maybe this is becoming a little too granular for a call, and I apologize if so. I'm just trying to hone in on specifically those years and understand maybe the net numbers that you're talking about are actually a larger gross loss from those years, offset by maybe some favorability from other years. Beth Costello : Yeah. I mean, there can be some back and forth. I wouldn't call out anything significant on that. I mean, on our more current years, especially on lines like GL, we do tend to hold our loss picks longer. We definitely through several quarters had seen some improvement that we recognized on the 2020 year. But again, nothing that significant that I would call out. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then the other question I had was on the Navigators book. So I think at the time of the acquisition, the U.S. casualty book was about 40% of the business. What does that come to as of today, either premium-wise or as a percentage of the overall specialty book? Chris Swift : I'm going to disappoint you. I don't have those numbers in front of me and I'm not going to try to guess. So we'll just work through Susan to get you that number if that's important to you. Yaron Kinar : Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back to Ms. Susan Spivak for closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Abby. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. And as always, please reach out with additional questions, if we didn't get to your question. I am available this afternoon and look forward to speaking with you then. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. And we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I will start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which are simply stellar. Then I'll turn the call over to Beth to dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics, after which I will close our prepared remarks with a review of expectations for 2024. We then will be joined by our business leaders as we move into Q&A. So let's get started. The Hartford is pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter, capping another outstanding year of financial performance and achievement of our strategic objectives. These results demonstrate the power of the franchise and in particular, our superior underwriting execution, depth of distribution relationships and unmatched customer experience. I am grateful for the commitment, dedication and hard work of our 19,000 employees who show up every day to deliver for our customers, partners and shareholders. Let me call your attention to some highlights for both the quarter and the year. Top line growth in Commercial Lines was 9% for the quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 86.6%, and growth was 10% for the year with an 87.8% underlying combined ratio. We achieved strong renewal written pricing increases across P&C during the quarter and for the year, including notable double-digit increases in commercial property, personal auto and homeowners in the quarter. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth was 6% for the quarter with a core earnings margin of 9.8%, and growth was 7% for the year with a core earnings margin of 8.1%. We delivered strong investment performance with an 80 basis points increase in the portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships for the full year. All these items contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading core earnings ROE of 15.8%. Now let me share a few details from each of our businesses. Our Commercial Lines business completed its third straight year of double-digit top line growth and underlying margin expansion. Written premium growth of 10% for the year was driven by meaningful exposure growth, pricing increases across most lines and strong new business growth in each of our three businesses. As expected, underlying margins improved 0.5 point as slight headwinds in workers' compensation were more than offset by earned pricing, exceeding loss cost trends across the rest of the portfolio and by improved expense leverage. Small Commercial remains a highly profitable growth engine for The Hartford. 2023 included record-breaking annual written premium of $5 billion and a decade-long trend of annual sub-90 underlying combined ratios. Spectrum, our best-in-class package product, continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace, contributing to annual new business premium growth up 20% over prior year. I\u2019m incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial, a business we expect will sustain outstanding results with industry-leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy. Moving to Middle & Large Commercial. The performance has also been truly exceptional. Our team has improved annual underlying margins by approximately 10 points since 2019, while adding over $900 million in written premium at a 7% compounded annual growth rate. In 2023, written premiums grew 9%, reflecting strong rate execution and new business growth. Submissions, quotes and the hit rate are all up over prior year as we leveraged advanced underwriting capabilities, particularly within the low end of Middle Market. The stellar results in this business are a direct result of data science advancements, pricing expertise and industry-leading tools. Combining these advantages with our best-in-class talent and the strength of our distribution relationships, we are well positioned to sustain profitable growth in this business. In Global Specialty, advanced underwriting capabilities and continued discipline are driving targeted market share gains with excellent underlying margin performance that has hovered in the low to mid-80s for the past seven quarters. Our competitive position, breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove an 11% increase in net written premium for the year, including 33% in our Global Reinsurance business and mid double-digit growth in U.S. professional liability and international marine and energy. New business growth of 7% for the year and 20% for the fourth quarter was driven by significant increases in both submissions and quotes and wholesale. Renewal written pricing continues to accelerate in wholesale excess casualty, and property pricing has been above 20% all year. We remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and across Global Specialty with execution that has never been stronger. Looking across Commercial Lines. We are particularly pleased by the growth in property lines, a key area of focus. We will continue to capitalize on favorable market conditions with a thoughtful and disciplined approach. Property written premium of $2.5 billion for the year was approximately 20% higher than 2022. Turning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal written pricing was 6%, an increase from 5.5% in the third quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing rose four-tenths to 8.5% with strong property pricing at 11%, auto closing in on double-digits and many liability lines in the high single-digits. Public D&O pricing remained pressured, although the fourth quarter result was the lowest pricing decrease since the second quarter of 2022. In workers' compensation, renewal written pricing continues to exceed expectations, remaining slightly positive in the quarter. All in, ex comp renewal, written pricing in Commercial Lines remains comfortably on top of loss costs trends in the fourth quarter. In summary, Commercial Lines produced an exceptional quarter, closing out a very successful 2023. Moving to Personal Lines. I\u2019m pleased with our continued progress to address elevated loss costs trends in both auto and home. During the quarter, we achieved auto renewal written price increases of nearly 22% and new business rate adequacy in over half the states, representing two-thirds of our new business premium. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.7% during the quarter, comprised of net rate and insured value increases, outpaced underlying loss cost trends. Our focus on the preferred market within the Personal Lines business is a competitive advantage with our modern, innovative and digitally enhanced offering, Prevail. This product and platform are currently available in 41 states with additional states coming online in 2024. Turning to Group Benefits. We had an exceptional year, delivering record core earnings of $567 million and an outstanding core earnings margin of 8.1% and strong fully insured ongoing premium growth of 7%, demonstrating focused execution, a resilient economy, improved mortality trends and continued strong disability results. 2023 disability loss ratio of 67.1% reflects low long-term disability incidence trends and favorable claim recoveries. In 2023, group life mortality trends have improved, though they remain above pre-pandemic levels. We expect the Group Benefits market to remain dynamic with digital transformation, product innovation and increasing customer demands. As a result, we are investing in this business and have a clear road map that I\u2019m confident will only strengthen our market leadership position. For example, building on our historically strong presence in national accounts with an enhanced approach for small to midsized employers, we view this as a key strategic initiative, leveraging our unique expertise in these markets. In addition, as we have discussed before, we struck a partnership with Beam, a dental and vision company to expand our product offerings for small to midsized employers. Overall, the strength of our Group Benefits diversified product portfolio, our commitment to outstanding customer experience using data and technology resonates in this marketplace, cementing our leadership position. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $935 million or $3.06 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 15.8%. Commercial Lines had a very strong quarter and year with core earnings of $723 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. And an underlying combined ratio of 86.6 for the quarter and 87.8 for the year. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 85.8 compared to 87.5 in the prior year fourth quarter. For the year, growth was 10% and the underlying combined ratio was 88.6. Middle & Large Commercial delivered its third straight quarter of written premium over $1 billion with 11% growth and an underlying combined ratio of 90.3. For 2023, growth was 9% with an underlying combined ratio of 89.3 compared to 92.1 in the prior year. Global Specialty\u2019s fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 82.9 and for the year improved 30 basis points to 84.3. In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter were $36 million with an underlying combined ratio of 99.5, including a strong homeowner\u2019s underlying combined ratio of 67.3. The fourth quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 113.5 was better than our expectations due to lower auto physical damage losses. This result is an improvement of 5.1 points from the fourth quarter of 2022 once that quarter is adjusted for the adverse development recorded in the first half of 2023 related to the fourth quarter of 2022. Also, I will point out that during the fourth quarter of this year, we made no adjustments to loss reserves for prior accident years. As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the lost cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium and personal lines increased 12% over the prior year driven by steady and successful rate actions. In Auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 21.9% and earned pricing increases of 15.5%. In addition, we received approval for an 18.7% rate increase in California that was effective in January. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 14.7% for the quarter and 14% on an earned basis. The total Personal Lines expense ratio improved by 10 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by higher direct marketing cost. With respect to CATs P&C current accident year catastrophes were $81 million before tax, which compares to catastrophe losses of $135 million in the prior year quarter. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $102 million, primarily concentrated in commercial lines as reserve reductions in workers\u2019 compensation, catastrophes and bond were partially offset by reserve increases in assumed reinsurance and commercial auto liability. We completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study in the fourth quarter, resulting in an increase in reserves of $194 million comprised of $156 million for asbestos and $38 million for environmental. All of the $194 million was ceded to the adverse development cover. The increase in asbestos reserves was primarily due to an increase in the cost of resolving asbestos filings and a modest increase in the company\u2019s share of loss on a few specific individual accounts. The increase in environmental reserves was mainly due to higher estimated site remediation costs, including an increase in the estimates for PFAS exposures. After taking into consideration this year\u2019s study, as of December 31, we have $62 million of coverage remaining on the A&E ADC and a deferred gain of $788 million. For our Navigators ADC, We have previously ceded the full limit of $300 million, of which $209 million has been recognized as a deferred gain within other liabilities. In 2024 we expect to start collecting recoveries on the ADC and as a result, amortization of the deferred gain is expected to begin in the first quarter. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect total amortization of the deferred gain in 2024 will be approximately $125 million pre-tax, with the remaining balance amortized in 2025. This will positively impact net income and have no impact to core earnings. Before turning to Group Benefits, I would like to review the January 1 reinsurance renewals. Overall, we were very pleased with the placements and terms and conditions for our program. Our expiring core per occurrence catastrophe protection was renewed at an approximate 5% decrease in cost on a risk adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information, compares favorably with the overall market and speaks to the quality of our book of business, strong reinsurer relationships and favorable experience. There were some minor changes in the treaty that provides coverage for certain loss events under $350 million, but overall the structure of our property CAT program did not change significantly. Additionally, we secured another $300 million layer on top of our program through a combination of traditional reinsurance and sponsorship of a catastrophe bond. The addition of CAT bond protection furthers our goal of securing diversified, strongly rated protection that affords durability in both cost and availability. The majority of our occurrence protection is secured on a multiyear basis. As of January 1, we have protection up to a gross loss event of $1.4 billion. We also renewed our aggregate treaty under the same structure and terms with favorable pricing from a risk adjusted perspective. You\u2019ve heard Chris reference our strategic growth in property writings. These changes ensure a consistent level of protection in keeping with that growth. We have summarized these changes in the slide deck and in addition to our property catastrophe program, we also successfully renewed several other reinsurance treaties that experienced limited changes in terms, conditions and rates. Moving to Group Benefits. We achieved record core earnings of $174 million for the quarter and $567 million for the full year. Core earnings margin of 9.8% in the quarter and 8.1% for the full year reflects strong premium growth, improved life results and continued strong disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 63.6 for the quarter improved 1.9 points over prior year, reflecting continued strong long-term disability claim recoveries. For the year the group disability loss ratio improved 1.2 points to 67.1. The group life loss ratio of 83 for the quarter improved 6.1 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. For the year the group life loss ratio improved 3.9 points to 83.5. The expense ratio improved 0.8 points for the quarter and 1 point for the year, reflecting strong top line performance and expense efficiencies somewhat offset by continued investments to meet our customers evolving needs. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $71 million contributed to a full year sales total of $839 million. This, combined with excellent persistency at above 90%, resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 6% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Our diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter net investment income was $653 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates and we continue to be pleased with a positive 150 basis point differential between our reinvestment rate and the yield on sales and maturities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships was 4.3% before tax, 20 basis points higher than the third quarter. Looking forward to 2024, we are expecting 15 to 20 basis points of improvement reflective of the current yield environment. This increase combined with portfolio asset growth is expected to contribute approximately $135 million to net investment income before tax, excluding LPs. Our annualized LP returns were 7% in the quarter. Full year 2023 LP returns were 4.8%, reflecting the resiliency of our private equity portfolio, which helped offset the slightly negative returns in the real estate equity portfolio. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Fixed maturity valuations increased in the quarter as a result of lower interest rates and tighter spreads. Net credit losses, including intent to sell impairments remain insignificant along with a modest increase of $5 million in the allowance for credit losses on the mortgage loan portfolio. All of our mortgage loans continue to be current with respect to interest and principal payments. Turning to capital. As of December 31 holding company resources totaled $1.1 billion. For 2024, we expect total dividends from the operating companies of approximately $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the first quarter. As of year-end, we had $1.35 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. To wrap up, 2023 business performance was strong and we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Chris. Chris Swift : Thank you, Beth. Let\u2019s now pivot forward. Strong fourth quarter results capped a year of outstanding financial performance, positioning us to sustain these results in 2024. In Commercial Lines with our diversified and expanding product portfolio and innovative mindset, we are primed to continue to build market share at highly attractive margins. We expect total renewal written price increases in Commercial Lines, excluding workers\u2019 compensation to be consistent with 2023. Workers\u2019 compensation and renewal written pricing, which is composed of net rate and average wage growth is projected to be flat to slightly negative. We expect underlying margins to be consistent with 2023, reflecting our steadfast commitment to disciplined underwriting while sustaining industry-leading results. While we anticipate slight headwinds in workers\u2019 compensation, earned pricing is projected to remain on top of loss costs trends across the remainder of the Commercial Lines book. Turning to Personal Lines. We expect annual renewal written pricing in both auto and home to be consistent with the fourth quarter results. In auto, as a result of the significant written pricing actions that will earn into the book combined with moderating severity trends, we expect meaningful underlying loss ratio improvement of five to six points during 2024. Earned pricing in home is expected to remain above loss costs trends. As we navigate this inflationary period across Personal Lines, we are focused on balancing rate adequacy, quality of new business and marketing productivity. Overall, I am confident we have the right execution plan to return this business to targeted profitability in 2025. In Group Benefits, we expect the 2024 core earnings margin to be between 6% and 7%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this business. In closing, let me summarize why I\u2019m so bullish about the future. First, 2023 financial results demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and the ongoing investments in our business. In particular, underlying margins in Commercial Lines were excellent with meaningful top line growth, and we produced record core earnings in Group Benefits with strong premium growth. Second, Personal Lines results have stabilized. We are achieving necessary rate increases and expect 2024 margins to improve towards our targeted profitability. Third, we expect our book of diversified, but complementary businesses will continue to sustain superior results. With our outstanding underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer-centric technology, we will continue to outperform. Fourth, investment income remains strong, supported by rising yields and a diversified and durable portfolio of assets. And finally, in the last three years, we have returned $6.2 billion of capital through repurchases and dividends, and we will continue to proactively manage our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford. Quarter-after-quarter, we are delivering industry-leading financial performance with a sustainable core earnings ROE anchored at 15% while creating value for all our stakeholders. Let me now turn the call back over to Susan for Q&A. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Chris. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Your line is up. Andrew Kligerman : Hey good morning. So, I\u2019m looking at the Commercial Lines expense ratio and with Hartford Next, you had significant improvement from 2021 to 2022. And then in the fourth quarter, you had 110 basis points of improvement. Now that Hartford Next is over, do you see that improvement continuing? And maybe to what degree? Chris Swift : Andrew, I\u2019ll start and then Beth can add her commentary. So yes, I appreciate you pointing out the numbers. I think also, too, on a year-to-date basis, 2022 to 2023, the 60 basis point improvement, which, on a full year basis, I think, is a good run rate. And all I would say is, philosophically, we do have a continuous improvement mindset in the organization to get after additional expense efficiencies. I wouldn\u2019t say we have a formal program that we called out. But clearly, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s goals to become more efficient, create that operating leverage that as we grow the franchise, we just \u2013 it\u2019s a good levered model that more earnings drops to the bottom line. But Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Thanks, Chris. I think you covered on the pieces very well. If we look at the full year expense ratio for Commercial Lines ending at 31%, I think that\u2019s a really great result. And as Chris said, we are going to continue to look for efficiencies. But we\u2019re also very mindful of making sure that we\u2019re putting in place the appropriate investments that allow us to continue to deliver the outstanding results that you see in our Commercial Lines franchise. Andrew Kligerman : And then shifting over to personal auto. You got a 21.9% rate increase. I want to make sure I understand that. That\u2019s \u2013 is that pure rate? Or is that exposure growth? And then secondly, Chris, if I understood you, did you say that you expected five to seven points of loss ratio improvement? Or could it be a lot more than that given the 21.9% rate increase? Chris Swift : Yes. Andrew, on your first point, and Stephanie can add in her commentary, the 21.9%, I think we achieved is vast, vast majority, all pure rate. There might be a little exposure in there but very, very little. And I did say five to six points of improvement in auto next year. So \u2013 no, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay with numbers, so I\u2019ll help you out, five to six. So, we ended the year at 110. We think we can get down to 104 next year on an underlying basis. And that\u2019s why, again, we\u2019re going to have to continue to execute and work hard in 2025 to get down then to targeted margins, which I would say, on an underlying basis on auto is generally in the 95% to 96% range. You put two points for catastrophes on there, and that\u2019s your overall combined ratio. So yes, that\u2019s our plan. As I said before, I think Stephanie and the team have a very executable plan. They\u2019re executing well in the marketplace today and balancing, balancing new business, balancing renewals and balancing our spend in marketing. Stephanie, would you add any additional color? Stephanie Bush : You covered it perfectly. Thank you. Andrew Kligerman : And would you drive any additional rate as we go through the year? Or you feel good about the... Chris Swift : Say it again. I didn\u2019t hear you clearly. Andrew Kligerman : Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Would you go for \u2013 would you seek additional rate increases as we move through the year? Or do you feel like the rates that you\u2019ve gotten so far should help drive you to the goals that you want to be at in 2025? Chris Swift : Yes. Clearly, the rate that we achieved this year is contributing. And as I said, we\u2019re anticipating 20 points of rate also next year, which is very important, because that then sets up getting back to our targeted margins in 2025. Andrew Kligerman : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Gregory Peters : Good morning everyone. I guess, I\u2019d like to go back to your comment in the outlook portion of your presentation, where you said the ROE is anchored at 15%. It sounds to me like there\u2019s been a step-up in your expectations on the ROE range. And I\u2019m not trying to put words in your mouth, but I\u2019m just trying to understand exactly what you meant by anchored at 15%. Chris Swift : Thank you for the question. I\u2019m happy to provide any clarity. I thought anchored was actually a pretty good word, because it really means sort of floor, in my mind. And Greg, we had a 14% to 15% ROE range as guidance last year. We\u2019re giving qualitative guidance this year as opposed to sort of the table. So, we really wanted to send a strong message that we\u2019re shifting and it\u2019s shifting higher. And the construct we came up with was let\u2019s just anchor 15% as far as the floor for everyone\u2019s expectations. We always, when we put out guidance, have a high probability of meeting that. And we play for upside. And you saw the way we ended 2023. And I\u2019d say I think we\u2019re off to a good start this year, and I think there will be upside in that floor number that we provide. But that was the mindset behind that. Gregory Peters : Excellent. That was my interpretation. Just wanted to make sure I had it right. So appreciate that. I want to pivot to the benefits side. I think \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry, I was writing down a bunch of numbers during the presentation. But I think you said the core earnings margin target for 2024 is going to be in the 6% to 7% range. It feels like there\u2019s been a step-up in the last couple of quarters in your core earnings margin. And then if I look at in Group Benefits for the full year, I think the core earnings margin for 2023 was 8.1% versus 6.5% in 2022. So is there something going on inside that business that\u2019s causing a step-down lower? Or maybe you can provide some color around the \u2013 your comments there? Chris Swift : Yes. Happy to, Greg. And I\u2019ll ask Jonathan Bennett who\u2019s with us to add his color. No, I think it\u2019s a great business. We\u2019ve always \u2013 I think it fits within The Hartford. It contributes mildly and it\u2019s improved, particularly coming out of COVID. So, I would just say that the 6% to 7%, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent. That\u2019s our long-term view. We\u2019re commenting on a long-term view for that business and particularly given some of the rate guarantees that are in that book of business. So \u2013 but I would also say that we had an excellent record year this year and that momentum, I think, will continue into 2024. And we like how it\u2019s positioned. We like our strategic initiatives. We like how we\u2019re investing for the future in this business. So yes, it\u2019s going to be and will remain a significant contributor going forward. Jonathan, what would you add? Jonathan Bennett : That's a great setup, Chris. And Greg, I would add to that, that we look at the trends in a range when we start to plan our future and think about the 2024. And in calendar year 2023, a lot of those trends turned in the right direction in our ranges, but certainly in the right direction within our ranges. We talked about life coming out of the pandemic that has pulled back into a pretty good spot. We have some continued pricing action that we will execute on in 2024 and a bit beyond. But when you think about where we are in LTD, incidence levels coming into the calendar year, terrific. Also, our claim team did a wonderful job around recoveries. These have been things going on for us in our disability book, our LTD book for a number of years. And we feel like we're in a really good place, and the market has also seen some improvement there, too. But when we think about when we're headed in 2024, we put a range around that. We're just reminding that there is a range around it. And we would expect these lines of business to continue to contribute and contribute very, very well, supplemental health included, which has also been a big part of our margin story here in the calendar year 2023. Chris Swift : Greg, one last point. Remember, that 6% to 7% we've commented upon before turns into a 14% to 15% tangible ROE. So again, it's another rising \u2013 reason why we like this business so much. Margins are generally steady predictable and our ROEs are very contributory to us, particularly on a tangible basis. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey great. Thanks. On the Commercial Lines guidance to kind of keep underlying margins consistent for 2024 versus 2023, that obviously would be a \u2013 margins are at a great absolute level and that would be a good outcome. But just kind of curious what your thoughts are? Any details on kind of social inflationary lines, a lot of your peers have been kind of embedding a slightly higher loss costs trend on the go-forward, getting some IBNR. Just curious kind of within that outlook, any context around kind of the puts and takes other than workers' comp, which you talked about during the prepared remarks? Chris Swift : Yes. Mike thanks for the question. Yes, those are a reality of our society today, right? Social inflation, legal system abuse, however you want to call it. So it's alive and well. It's nothing new for many, many industry participants, but it is still something you have to be aware of, particularly in the umbrella in the excess liability lines. I'll ask Mo to add his commentary. But I think we've been thoughtful about the trends over the last couple of years and the need to stay on top of those trends with rate. And that's why I say particularly, we're looking for an element of consistency with 2023. Because in a lot of those long-tail liability casualty lines we need high-single to low-double digit rate increases to stay on top of the trend assumptions that we have. So yes, it's all part of managing multiple product line approach. But again, in aggregate, I think the setup is very similar to last year's setup at the time when we talked about it is that there's going to be some slight pressure on comp. And we're going to try to maintain and expand margins where possible in other lines of business. But Mo, what would you say specifically in the casualty world? Mo Tooker : Yes. Mike, we're watching these trends closely, and we think the performance has been good. But that being said we continue to work hard on rate. Chris referenced wholesale casualty accelerated throughout the year. So we're trying to make sure we're keeping rate on top of or at least not ahead \u2013 if we can, ahead of trend. The same thing happened in our Middle Market GL book, rate accelerated throughout the course of the year. So we're working hard on rate. At the same time, we've talked to you about it a couple of times now. We're making sure that the underlying exposure we continue to adjust. So for the past three, four years we've been working hard in the jurisdictions we're in, our customers are in. We're working hard on the limits we're deploying. So there's some long-term strategies playing out here that give us some confidence in our ability to navigate, which is a difficult environment. Mike Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up is just on capital management. I see the guidance there. Just curious, top line growth has been fairly robust, which is obviously a good thing. If the top line growth kind of continues at similar-ish levels in 2024, which I assume as a capital user, I mean, should we be toggling maybe down the buyback levels a bit or am I splitting hairs here? Chris Swift : Yes. I'll let Beth add her color, but I think you're splitting hairs. So our opcos are well capitalized. You see what we have left in authorization through the end of 2024. Our intention is to complete that on a timely basis. But Beth, I don't want to take any more of your thunder. Beth Costello : Yes. No, I think you said it well, Chris. I mean we \u2013 I talked about our expectations for dividends from the operating companies in 2024, which is up slightly from 2023. In the past, I've talked about that we typically target about 70% to 80% of the earnings to dividend out of the subs, and that provides us with enough room to fund the growth that we're expecting, so really no change in how we're managing the balance sheet and balancing those items. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thanks. Chris, just curious, looking at the Small Commercial business, rate renewal pricing looks good. What do you think about exposure kind of the growth there as we look going forward? Is \u2013 what are you kind of seeing in that business? Do you think it's going to start to slow here in 2024 and could have an effect on top line? Chris Swift : Brian, I know what you're trying to triangulate to. So all I'd say qualitatively on any top line point because we're not going to give a precise number in aggregate or by line of business is, I think the macro sets up well. I think the economy is performing well. You saw the jobs report this morning, and unemployment remains low. You could see the Fed as being a little cautious on how quickly it cuts rates, which actually we support. So I think the macro sets up well. All I would tell you is that what we saw in January, early indications are much of the same coming out of 2023 and sort of that double-digit range in commercial. So one-month does not make a trend. But I think the environment will be fairly conducive to continuing going forward. So we perform very well when the economy is performing well, and I think that's the general view I have heading into 2024. Brian Meredith : Great. That's helpful. And then just another one here. There was another company that announced some reserving actions and specifically related to the construction liability business. I know Navigators used to write that. Maybe you can talk a little bit about your exposure to that business. Is that an area of concern? Just put maybe a little color around that? Chris Swift : Yes. There's always things to be concerned about and worry about. That's not one of the top ones and principally because bluntly we've been there done that. Part of our integration and activities with the acquisition we did years ago was to deal with sort of with those balance sheet reserving issues that we knew were there and saw. So I think we've tackled that appropriately. I think we've made the adjustments in those older years, adjusted our loss picks and trends going forward. So I feel very comfortable and confident we got our arms around that issue a couple of years back. Would you add anything, Mo? Mo Tooker : No. Brian, I'd just say there is an underwriting element here that, so when we made the changes and when we had the Navigators book come in, we shifted some of the underwriting in response to some of these trends. And that would have been two, three, four years ago. So we feel good about the go-forward book as well. Brian Meredith : Got you. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hey. Thanks. My first question is on capital, I guess, following up on the earlier discussion. So Beth, you said $350 million buyback in the Q1, which is in line with the Q4 level. But you did point out, right, like the dividends out of group are going to be a few hundred million dollars higher in 2024 relative to 2023. So I think that that would give you a tailwind to perhaps have a higher level of buybacks in 2024. Is it just timing of dividends? And should we think about buybacks picking up in the back three quarters? Beth Costello : Well, Elyse, I'll start with. I mean, we're executing on the share repurchase authorization that we have in place. And that is what we're executing to and as I said, we expect $350 million in the first quarter, and we'll continue to execute on that. As we think about dividends in total for 2024 operating company dividends versus 2023, they're up about $100 million in total. So that all obviously goes into how we think about the balance sheet strength going forward, but not making any changes on our current share repurchase plans. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks. And then my second question is on the Commercial Lines guidance. So I think you said underlying margins would be consistent but did point to a headwind in workers' comp. As Chris, I know you said pricing there would be flat-to-negative and we've gone through The Hartford Next program. So how do you think about the split between the loss and the expense ratio within commercial when you're coming to like an overall stable underlying margin in 2024? Chris Swift : Yes. Again, Elyse, what I tried to describe is that the setup is similar, right? So if there's pressure in comp, it needs to be offset by other components, non-comp in our product lines. You've seen what we've done with accelerating pricing, particularly in the fourth quarter. That mindset continues into 2024. So when I say hold or expand, that's what I mean. And look, I can't predict with great precision the top line, but I think there'll be some slight expense leverage. That will also contribute overall. So that's what I would say. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Question about adverse development covers. You have the NICO cover for the asbestos in 2017. You have the Navigators cover from a few years ago. Both are having or about to be exhausted. As a sort of operating principle, when you buy an adverse development cover, do you buy with the expectation that it's likely it's going to be exhausted? Is that how it's structured? Or do you \u2013 is it kind of a surprise that you get to the end of the cover? Chris Swift : So ADC utilization, all I would say is it really depends, obviously, right I mean on the obviously on the navigators acquisition. It was part of the purchase price and funding there and dealing with it. So that's different. The A&E deal that we did with NICO was just slightly different as far as long term. So if we would do anything again in the future, it would have to be economic for us first off, and a lot of those deals that we did prior were just in a lower interest rate environment, just a different part of our development as an organization. And our performance, so the guiding principle that Beth and I talk about all the time is just what makes sense from an economic side, because they're not cheap and they're actually expensive. So you give up things to do it, to have that economic cover. So I would just say, Josh, it depends, and we're going to always try to think in terms of what is the best economics for the shareholders and pursue then the right strategy from there. Josh Shanker : And back when you did the 2017 Governor, you were in a different capital position than you are today. I assume so. Even if there was a deal available to you today, perhaps it doesn\u2019t the urgency is different than it was seven, eight years ago. Chris Swift : Yes, I think you got it right. Totally. Six, seven, eight years ago, we were just in a different place. And I just think we're in a better place. We have prudence on the balance sheet. That feels good. And so, yes you're right. Totally different place. Josh Shanker : And the other question, also a philosophical one. I was talking to Aileen [ph] last night, and I think that these are the best commercial results you guys have had almost ever looked at. Going back to 2006, there was one quarter that might be better, and clearly it's the best group benefits results ever. What do you say to concerns that these might be peak margins? Chris Swift : Well, we never give up. We keep on pushing ourselves to reset the bar higher, perform better. We have a growth orientation now that I think we've earned the right to think differently and creatively about the marketplace and activities we could pursue that are profitable and accretive to our shareholders. Josh. So I would never, ever bet against us. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just had a question on the property book within Commercial Lines. It sounds like you guys had really good growth last year in line with what you guys are saying. How are you thinking about growth growing the property line in 2024 and if there's any sort of mix shift benefit that we should think about coming through incrementally to margins next year? Chris Swift : David, I would say, yes we're pleased with what we accomplished this year, but it's not the end of the mission or it's really just sort of the beginning. So growing that book about 20% to $2.5 billion, I'm looking at my pricing sheet, with overall pricing up on the full portfolio, about 16%. Our non-CAT property weather was essentially on plan for the year between our various business units. So feel really good about the underwriting, the tools. Obviously, our reinsurance programs that Beth talked about, we made adjustments to. So we have all the components. Obviously, it's still a constructive marketplace to really build that national diversified book of business that we want to have. So just because you asked, and I like you, I'm going to tell you that I think we could produce about $3 billion of premium next year. David Motemaden : Awesome. That's great. Thanks for that Chris. And then maybe just following up, good growth last year in Commercial Lines, up 10%. I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk about how much exposure maybe contributed to that in 2023. Chris Swift : Well, the exposure piece I can give you right now that I have in my mind is related to pricing, right? So if you look at our pricing expanding to 8.5% this quarter, about 2.5 points of it is exposure-related. So if you go back and look at \u2013 it's been generally consistent, sort of, I would say, one-third, two-third. So that's what I have there. But I'll look to Mo and Stephanie to see if they want to add any color on exposure and Personal Lines or Middle Market. Stephanie Bush : I'll start. It's Stephanie, David. From a Small Commercial perspective, I just want to continue on some of the comments that Chris and Beth made in the prepared remarks, but Small Commercial will continue to be a growth in earnings engine. You talked about exposure, but we look at many factors in small. We look at new business starts. Those remain healthy. Unemployment in our sector is healthy. We track small business owner sentiment and the likelihood of them to invest and hire, and that is at a high level. And again, audit premiums, again, still strong. So you take all that in combination with the results that we had, $913 million, all in just in new written premium. We grew every line. We grew policies in force in every line. And then as the team referenced that we delivered outstanding underlying in the fourth quarter and then our 14th consecutive quarter of 90 or below. So the business model is incredibly strong and powered by exceptional data analytics and an outstanding team. So Chris touched on it. We had an outstanding start to the year, but it's a long way to go. But I feel really confident in what we'll be able to continue to deliver. So I look at it broader than just exposure. It's all of those combinations. And then again, from a personal insurance perspective, I think Chris and Beth laid out our mission very well in the auto line as well as in the home line. Home results are very strong as well, and that contributes to our growth and our aspiration to be a stronger property market. So I'll turn it over to Mo. Mo Tooker : Yes. Many of the same messages. I think the exposure growth we are seeing, and again, across comp, property is holding in well and even into January is holding well. So I think we just \u2013 we and think the economy is very supportive there. So David, I don't have much more to add to Stephanie's summary there. David Motemaden : Got it. Understood. I appreciate the answer. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi, first one I had is on the Group Benefit dividends up to the Holdco took a nice step up. And just looking at the $600 million, I mean, that's more than the core earnings from 2023 by a bit. It seems to imply that you think some of this strength can continue in 2024. So I just wanted to understand that number a little bit. And we don't usually for these type of businesses see distributions in excess of earnings. So is there any excess capital drawdown there to consider, those kind of things? Beth Costello : Yes. I'll take that, Alex. No, I mean, again, we're looking at it on a statutory basis. And obviously, dividends out of Group Benefits have been lower over the last couple of years given those results. So as we looked at what the dividend capacity was there for 2024, we felt it was appropriate to increase those dividends. Alex Scott : Got it. All right. Helpful. Just on the \u2013 going back to the environmental and given we got to think about it a little harder with ADC closer to being used up. I know you mentioned the PFAS. Could you give us a sense of what kind of adjustments are made around PFAS? And is that related to any specific developments? Or do we need to think about that as something that could impact things going forward? Beth Costello : Yes. I mean, again, I think we've mentioned PFAS on environmental the last couple of years. And overall, we looked at what the increase was for environmental, not overly significant or a big change from where we've been. So I wouldn't point to anything unusual there. It's just as we went through our study this year and just looked at all components, saw some increases in some of the remediation costs. And as is our practice, I'm not going to talk about specific accounts and where that came from. Alex Scott : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Susan Spivak for some final closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you so much for all joining us today. And as always, please \u2013 oh, thank you for all joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Christopher Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford had a strong start to the year, sustaining outstanding financial results through the first quarter. Our strategy and ongoing investments, combined with disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, and innovative customer-centric technology, continue to drive outperformance.  Let me call your attention to some highlights we achieved in the quarter. Top line growth in Commercial Lines of 8% and with an underlying combined ratio of 88.4%, strong renewal written pricing increases in Commercial and Personal Lines, Group Benefits core earnings margin of 6.1% and solid performance in our investment portfolio, all these contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.6% reflecting consistency of our margins and a continued growth generated by our businesses.  Now let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines performance reflects strong top line growth at highly profitable margins. In the marketplace, we are prudently taking advantage of elevated submission flow, in part driven by the investments we have made to expand our product capabilities and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience.  From that flow, we are using our data science advancements, pricing expertise in industry-leading underwriting tools to drive profitable double-digit new business growth in each of our three businesses. In addition, retention is steady and exposure growth remains solid although moderating from the elevated levels seen in the past couple of years. In Small Commercial, we are shattering previous quarterly written premium records while sustaining underlying margins. New business growth was 11% in the quarter, driven by strong submission flow and growth in E&S binding. We are particularly pleased with E&S binding, a key area of focus, which is on track to grow annual written premiums by approximately 50% in 2024 to nearly $300 million. I remain incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial and bullish on its outlook. We expect to sustain outstanding financial results by reliably serving agents and customers with industry-leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy. Moving to Middle & Large Commercial. The financial performance continues to be exceptional. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution and new business growth of 18% with an especially good quarter in guaranteed cost construction and general industries. We are building a track record of delivering meaningful growth while consistently maintaining underlying margins.  The stellar performance in this business is a direct result of our underwriting discipline, enabled by the investments we have made to enhance our capabilities. Combining these advantages with our best-in-class talent and the strength of our distribution relationships, we remain well positioned to profitably grow this business.  In Global Specialty, results were excellent with underlying margins consistent with last year and solid top line growth reflecting our competitive position, breadth of products and strong renewal written pricing. Written premium growth was propelled by a 20% increase in our wholesale business with significant contributions from primary and excess casualty lines.  We are particularly pleased with wholesale construction activity found in the quarter as well as overall increased submission flow, both meaningful drivers of new business growth. We remain excited about the Global Specialty business, including our position in wholesale and reinsurance market and from a broadened product portfolio.  Looking across Commercial Lines, we continue to grow our property book, another key area of focus. We are capitalizing on favorable market conditions with a disciplined approach, including no change in our catastrophe risk appetite. Property written premium for the quarter was approximately 17% higher than in 2023. Turning to pricing. Excluding workers' compensation, Commercial Lines renewal written pricing rose [ 0.7% ] from the fourth quarter to 9% with strong low double-digit pricing in property and auto and high single digit in general liability.  Public D&O pricing is still pressured, though relatively stable with the fourth quarter. All in, ex comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remained comfortably above loss cost trends. In workers' compensation, renewal written pricing remained slightly positive in the quarter. In summary, Commercial Lines delivered an outstanding first quarter results with ongoing momentum in the market.  Moving to Personal Lines. Our first quarter financial performance demonstrate the progress towards restoring targeted profitability in auto, as we continue to address current loss trends. Auto renewal written price increases of nearly 26% have likely peaked given our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year. In addition, we have achieved new business rate adequacy in the vast majority of states and as a result have resumed national advertising this month. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends.  This year, we are celebrating our 40th anniversary with AARP. In 1984, we embarked on this journey with a shared vision and commitment to serve mature market customers. Our focus on this preferred segment, coupled with our modern innovative and digitally enhanced product and platform prevail is a competitive advantage. Our updated offering is currently available in 42 states and represents approximately 60% of our new business premium this quarter. With pricing gains, enhanced risk segmentation, and moderating loss trends, I expect Personal Lines to meaningfully contribute to core earnings as it returns to profitability in 2024 and reaches target margins in 2025.  Turning to Group Benefits. Our core earnings margin of 6.1% for the quarter included improved mortality trends from the prior year and continued strong long-term disability claim recoveries. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% reflects strong but slightly lower persistency and a 6% decline in sales primarily driven by group life, where we are being disciplined with pricing and underwriting in this competitive marketplace. We continue to strengthen our capabilities for customer service, with an extensive suite of tools for HR platform integration, member enrollment, process simplification and analytics. As part of our strategy to grow amongst small and midsized businesses, we are investing in our platform. This includes strengthening distribution relationships and actively seeking out new partnerships. Employers are more focused than ever on the needs of their employees and our products and services are a key part of that value proposition.  Moving to investments. The portfolio continues to support The Hartford's financial and strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions, and Beth will provide more details. In summary, The Hartford delivered another strong quarter with sustained momentum heading into the remainder of the year.  Let me reiterate why I am so bullish about the future. First, our financial results continue to prove the effectiveness of our strategy and the impact of ongoing investments in our business. Second, Personal Lines results are showing improvement. We are achieving necessary rate increases, and expect 2024 margins to progress towards targeted profitability. Third, with our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, an innovative customer-centric technology, we will continue to sustain superior results. Fourth, investment income remained solid, supported by elevated yields and a diversified and durable portfolio of assets. And finally, we remain dedicated to enhancing shareholder value through supporting organic growth, continued investment in our business and proactively managing our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford, and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Bombara : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $709 million or $2.34 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.6%. Commercial Lines had an outstanding quarter with core earnings of $546 million and an underlying combined ratio of 88.4%, in line with our expectations and slightly better than the prior year first quarter.  Small Commercial continued to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 8%, and an underlying combined ratio of 89.6, further building on its impressive track record of delivering an underlying combined ratio below 90. Middle & Large Commercial also delivered outstanding results with 9% growth over the prior year and this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of written premium exceeding $1 billion. The underlying combined ratio was excellent at 89.2, a 0.7 point improvement over first quarter 2023, primarily due to a lower expense ratio driven by the impact of strong earned premium growth.  Global Specialty's underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 85.3, relatively flat to the prior year. Written premium growth of 8% was driven by accelerating renewal written price increases and new business growth of 17%, excluding Global Re. In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter were $33 million with an underlying combined ratio of 96.1, including a strong homeowners underlying combined ratio of 77. The auto underlying combined ratio of 104.4 was in line with our expectations and is a year-over-year improvement of 3.7 points. Once the reported ratio for the first quarter of 2023 is increased for the 3 points of development that occurred in the second quarter of 2023.  This result is consistent with achieving the 5- to 6-point full year improvement we previously discussed. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 13% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 25.7% and earned pricing increases of 19.1%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 15.2% for the quarter and 14.4% on an earned basis. The total Personal Lines expense ratio improved by 1.2 points, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by higher direct marketing costs as we increase our marketing spend to drive new business growth in those states where rates are adequate.  With respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year cats were $161 million before tax or 4.2 combined ratio points which compares to $185 million in 2023 or 5.3 points on the combined ratio. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $32 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, which were partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance and ocean marine.  In addition, we had $7 million of favorable development in personal auto physical damage. We also recorded $24 million before tax in deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC. This positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect total amortization of the deferred gain in 2024 will be approximately $125 million before tax with the remaining balance amortized in 2025.  We have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck on both this ADC and the A&E ADC for your reference.  Turning to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the first quarter of $107 million and a 6.1% core earnings margin reflect improved life results, continued strong disability performance and fully insured premium growth. As a reminder, from a seasonality perspective, we tend to experience higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter.  The group disability loss ratio of 70.1 improved 0.3 points from 2023, driven by continued strong claim recoveries, partially offset by higher incidents in paid family leave and short-term disability products. The group life loss ratio of 82.6 improved 4.1 points versus prior year, reflecting improved mortality.  Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was driven by exposure growth, which remained positive, albeit at a lower rate than in the prior year. Book persistency in the first quarter of 2024 was strong at over 90%, but approximately 1.5 points below record high levels in 2023.  Turning to investments. Our diversified investment portfolio continues to produce solid results. For the quarter, net investment income was $593 million. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.3% before tax, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023. Our annualized LP returns were 1.3% and included positive returns from our private equity portfolio. Our real estate equity portfolio returns were impacted by lower valuations and the absence of real estate JV equity sales.  Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, limited partnership returns in the second quarter are likely to be similar to first quarter results, with private equity returns being offset by declines in real estate valuations and property depreciation with no sales activity.  We continue to believe our real estate holdings are durable, and we will be patient as it relates to any sales in order to maximize value. Although we anticipate LP returns for the full year could be below 2023 results, we continue to believe that over the long term, results will continue to add value and be consistent with historical returns. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Net credit losses remain insignificant. Turning to capital. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. To wrap up, our first quarter results reflect another quarter of delivering on our targeted returns to enhance value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Bernstein : Thank you. We will now take your questions. Operator, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Kligerman at TD Securities. Andrew Kligerman : Chris, I noticed in your opening remarks, you talked about some pressure on group life sales. Is that something that you foresee going forward? I mean overall sales were -- I think revenues were up about 2% in the quarter. So do you see that line being a bit pressured and maybe you could give us a little color on what's happening in the group life area? Christopher Swift : Happy to, Andrew. Welcome. Yes, we did call out a little lighter sales volume during the quarter. I'm looking at Jonathan Bennett, he could give you additional color also. But I think, Andrew, you might recall, we've talked about being fairly disciplined in our thinking about where mortality is trending, particularly coming out after the pandemic. And the trends are downward, but we probably -- we believe we're still operating in an endemic state of mortality, which means it's going to be higher than normal, which we think will continue for at least the next couple of years. And we've been pricing our product with that view, which obviously has an impact then on sales if market participants don't have a similar view.  So I think it's all good, it's all healthy. For us, again, key message I want you to know we're being discipline, but it might come at a cost of slightly lower group life sales than we maybe have enjoyed in the past.  But Jonathan, what would you add? Jonathan Bennett : Yes, Chris, I agree with everything you've said. And I think, Andrew, just reinforced the importance of us having our point of view and executing on that in the marketplace. If you think about where we are in the group life cycle, we're looking to the future, we're seeing improvements. When you look back at your trends, which is where you start and thinking about your pricing philosophy, a lot of that data is loaded with excess mortality and COVID losses. So the first step you have to do is figure out what to extract, how to normalize, if you will, for that data. And it might sound obvious to say, well, just take all the COVID claims out, but that's not how they always get reported. And so as a result, there is a fair amount of variation in judgment applied as you do that.  And then looking forward, you need to make a call on where you feel like mortality will be in the next 3 to 5 years. And as we sit here today, if you were to pull some CDC data, I think you would see that the reported deaths are still trending -- are still a bit higher than they were prior to the pandemic. So when we weave all that in, we have our conviction about where we think things are going. But I would say the range right now in the marketplace in pricing is about as wide as it's been ever based on all of those ambiguities and how pricing can be developed.  And that really is, I think, what's the cause for some uncertainty in the marketplaces. But as Chris said, we have a strong point of view on where we are. We're confident and comfortable with that and we'll continue to compete. Our capabilities are actually as strong as ever in that marketplace, and we feel quite good about our positioning. Andrew Kligerman : That's very helpful. And then my follow-up is, there's been a ton of talk now about long-tail reserving. I mean, for a while, it's been 16 to 19 underwriting years. Now people are talking about 20 to 22 or 23. And when we looked at your reserves this quarter, I mean, it looked pretty modest in general liability and assumed re, and marine, and those were 16 to 19 years per your releases.  Any concerns? I mean, you looked great, but some of your competitors didn't. And so anything to read into going forward? Any concerns on your part? Christopher Swift : Yes, Andrew, I'll start and I'll let Mo and Beth add their commentary. But yes, I'm not going to speak to competitors because everyone is just slightly different, but the confidence that we have particularly in our current loss picks are very, very high. And I think the context that I think Mo and Beth will explain to you is that we've been hard at work in sort of improving our underwriting our book, reunderwriting it, looking at different classes of business, changing terms and conditions, and Mo will give you more color. Beth can talk about the actuarial analysis that we do on a quarterly basis, which is very robust and gives us a high degree of confidence in our picks, particularly for the most recent years.  But we're also humble enough to admit we didn't get everything right over the last 5 years. And when we feel that adjustments are made, we're pretty clear and transparent about why we're making those adjustments, and that will continue going forward. But Andrew, as we sit here today, I think you got it right, we feel good, we're not immune, but on a relative basis, I think we'll be better than most.  But Mo, Beth, what would you add? Beth Bombara : So I'll start, and then I'll let Mo provide some color and just add on to what Chris indicated. But as you noted, Andrew, in the general liability reserves, the prior year development that we recorded this quarter was related to the 2016 to 2019 years since some large loss activity. And as Chris said, we do evaluate these reserves quarter-to-quarter and when we see activity, we do react to it.  As it relates to the more current years, those tend to trend very well. As you know, these are long-tail liabilities. So even if in the short term, they're looking strong. We don't react to that because, as I said, these are long tailed in nature. But overall, we've not seen things in the more recent years that would cause us to change our picks at this point. And when I look at a variety of measures, and I know you do as well, IBNR levels, paid activity, I think our more recent accident years stand out as being strong. But it's also really important to understand, as Chris was indicating, actions that we've taken over this period to improve the overall book, which even adds to how we feel about our overall reserves in the more current years.  But maybe, Mo, I'll turn it to you to talk about some of the things that you and your team have been doing over the last several years in this area. Adin Tooker : Yes, Andrew, maybe three themes just to build on Beth's point about actions we've taken over that time period. So first is, obviously, we've put significant rate in each of those years since 2019 in each of the three books, and that is well in excess of some healthy trend. Second theme I would put out there is just remember the SME nature of our book, I mean, we just have a lower underlying, for example, auto exposure. Just to give you 1 stat, 79% of our middle-market umbrella book attaches for clients with less than 10 vehicles. So it gives you a sense of the size of fleets, which is where a lot of the pressure is coming from is just auto. We don't have a transportation book of any real note. We don't really -- we've never deployed limits of greater than $25 million gross, and we have important reinsurance involved there. And then the third, Andrew, I just -- I think we've taken significant underwriting actions as both Chris and Beth referred to, since 2019, and that's industry related, it's related to litigation hotspots. We've managed limits. Just as one example in our global specialty book, we got out of all primary GL high-hazard in 2017. We just didn't think we could make money. And we haven't gone back in just because we still don't think that marketplace is there.  And so I just -- Andrew, I hope that gives you a sense of the book, and we continue to invest in tools that are allowing our underwriters to make choices based on litigation hotspots, based on industry, based on underlying auto. So we just -- we've worked really hard at this, and I think that contributes to some of the lack of news that you're seeing here. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Elyse Greenspan at Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question was on the Personal Lines side. Just kind of following up, I think, Chris, you said that you guys are kind of turning on new business growth or did turn on this quarter that you're at rate adequacy in the vast majority of states.  Can you just give us a sense, I guess, what are you seeing from a frequency and severity perspective right now? And what do you expect, I guess, looking out over the next 12 months, you said when you put the expectation out that you expect to get to profitability this year and then reach the target in 2025? Christopher Swift : Elyse, thank you for the question and joining us. We're pretty pleased with the start on Personal Lines in totality. You saw the metrics that we've talked about, 25.7% written rate increase for auto, 15-ish in home, and I think the team is executing very, very well. I would give you a couple of data points to have you consider. As we think about the full year in '24, we still see auto getting about 20 points of rate, plus or minus. So we still have that conviction, which then lays the foundation for the targeted profitability in 2025 that we've been talking about. I would say we're beginning to see moderation both in our auto loss cost trends on a BI and a PD basis, not going to give you precise numbers just because it could be bouncy any 1 quarter to 1 quarter.  But overall trends for '23, let's say, we're in the mid-single digits. And I expect -- excuse me, mid-double digits. And I expect that to come down into the low double-digit range here in '24. Maybe there could be more improvement from there, but that's our best call at this point in time.  And I think Beth importantly reiterated our point of view that we do see 5 to 6 points of underlying auto loss ratio improvement in 2024. And I think that, again, will put us on the right track to hitting targeted profitability in '25. So yes, we are rate adequate in 80% of our states. There's a couple of states that are going to be laggards for a while. They'll go nameless. But we feel good about what we're doing with auto.  And then likewise, with home, you saw the underlying combined ratios improved over years. I thought our cat performance in total for the quarter, although slightly elevated to expectations, was still in line or within a range of long-term trends. So pleased with the team and what they're doing both in auto and home in Personal Lines.  Beth, would you add anything? Beth Bombara : Yes. Just a couple of things. Also, I'd point out that we did see some favorable development on the '23 accident year primarily coming out of the fourth quarter for auto physical damage. So we see that as an important proof point, too. I just want to clarify on Chris' comment on the book loss trend, mid-teens.  So that is mid double-digit, but just to be clear, mid-teens, and we do expect that to decline over the period. But as Chris said, we're being cautious and looking at it very carefully and feel very good to be on track to get to the improvement that we laid out at the beginning of the year. Elyse Greenspan : And then my follow-up is on Commercial Lines. Looking at the price disclosure, stable on a reported basis, right, but that obviously reflects the comp concentration. How do you guys see just pricing across Commercial Lines playing out as we move through this year? Christopher Swift : Yes. I'll add my color, and then Mo will add his. But I hope you felt it in our tone, Elyse, we're really pleased. The team is working hard from an execution side, to have ex-comp. Our written renewal rate increased, increased to 70 basis points, I thought it was healthy. That does include an element of exposure to that excess rate, which we call out in the general 2.3 points range or 25% exposure, 75% rate base. So I think we see a lot of stability in the marketplace and still very optimistic as we play out 2024 here. So I think that, again, why we talked about early on of the year of the stability of our margins and generally having a consistent outcome compared to 2023, I think it's still alive and well in our thesis as we execute here through midyear.  But Mo, what would you add? Adin Tooker : Yes, Elyse, I would say it's competitive but generally supportive because we talked about properties moderating a little bit outside of our BOP, and the BOP is still accelerating just in terms of what we're able to get there in terms of rate. The excess in umbrella is accelerating again, and auto is accelerating again. So broadly, I just -- I think we feel like the market is being fairly disciplined, fairly disciplined, and supportive of what we're trying to get done for the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gregory Peters at Raymond James. Charles Peters : Great. So Chris, in your prepared comments, you talked about the no change in sort of the catastrophe profile of your property business. And yet you said that you're growing your property business, I think you -- the number you cited was 17% higher in the quarter. Maybe you can help reconcile how you grow your property business and not change your cat profile? Christopher Swift : Well, cat profile versus risk appetite, I'd see a little difference. I mean, we're not increasing our property cat appetite per se. We've always said that we're willing to write property if it comes with some incremental small elements of cat, in which I think we've been managing perfectly and Mo could give you more colors.  But I would say -- and let me just give you a couple of stats is that pricing in our property book, ex our Global Re business is about 14% up compared to 14.4% in the fourth quarter. As I said, we're growing at 17% and we're growing it in an important line : spectrum, E&S binding, our general industries properties.  Our large property capabilities are up almost 35%. And again, the pricing, I think, is still firmed and holding up pretty well. But Mo, what would you add? Adin Tooker : Yes, Greg, I would just say that there are a couple of cat metrics that the team were really focused on. And for example, a, also annual aggregate loss to premium ratios trying to keep those flat. So as premium goes up, obviously, we would like the AAL to stay relatively flat. And the same thing as we think about tail, we don't want to put on the risk without thinking about the tail risk. So we are closely looking at tail multiples like, for example, 100-year PMLs over premium. So those are the types of ratios that we're watching. So yes, the exposure itself is growing certainly from a cat perspective, but we're trying to keep it in balance as to the same rate as premium growth. Charles Peters : Okay. That makes sense. So then building on some of your previous answers, I'm looking at the stats on new business production policy counts inside your commercial business and things look like they're going really well.  I do remember a couple of quarters ago, you calling out some price competition in the middle market area. Just trying to get an update on, it seems pretty stable and the outlook seems pretty bullish. But when you look forward, what are the areas that you're concerned about for potential competitive challenges? Christopher Swift : Yes. It's a competitive market. And I would say, especially in the larger end of each of our segments, so the larger end of small, we are finding more competitive, the larger end of middle is more competitive, and the larger end of the specialty business. So anything with a lot of premium on the slip typically has a little more competition to it.  But the only area that we're dramatically pulling back on is, as we've talked about many times, is public D&O. We just haven't seen that market stabilize the way we would like to. So you will see that book continue to shrink. Outside of that, Greg, I think we feel pretty good about the rest of the portfolio. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Shanker at Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : Looking at the rate that you're pushing through on auto, in particular, obviously, it's sizable. Year-over-year, the policy count is down is around about 5%, which -- that might be a good outcome given how much rate you're pushing through. One of your probably the largest direct competitor in the market, they raised prices not as much as you over the last couple of years have lost 20% of their business.  What is the experience of retaining clients given that you are a direct carrier and you only can present them with Hartford product? Are they wanting to change and you're committing them to stay? Are they doing buy-downs? How is that experience coming with the retention? Christopher Swift : Josh, thank you for joining us. Yes, that's the trade-off we're making right now, lower retention for a more profitable cohort to get us back to that targeted profitability. So I don't think it's outside of the range of expectations that we've had as far as that trade-off. I think we've talked about sort of the PIF count decline compared to 2023 before. We still see that in that 4% range. So again, that speaks to our conviction to get the necessary rate in the book. And you're right, I mean it's a direct response business. I mean, it's Middle America from a customer side. So there's not a lot of, I'll call it, financial engineering we're doing vis-a-vis rate buydowns on auto or home, deductibles, things like that. It's pretty straightforward. We're sort of -- again, strictly in the admitted business.  But I think generally, people understand the need to keep up with trend, the inflationary pressures, the weather patterns are changing, all the social litigation and legal abuse systems that we've talked about is keeping pressure on our loss cost. And again, we've been able to work with our regulators to get rates approved either on a pre-approved basis or file and use. So I think we're executing well, and it's still a very dynamic and challenged environment. Joshua Shanker : I don't mean to belabor the point, but I'm just curious if the customers are giving you a chance to retain them, are they calling up and asking what can we do to help me? Or are you just getting a notification that they've left to a competitor? Christopher Swift : I think it's more of the latter. I don't think we're having very many negotiations over the phone as far as our product and our offer. And we're being empathetic when we talk to our customers, particularly the mature customers, but there's not a negotiation. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Ward at Citi. Michael Ward : I was wondering if you could maybe help us with some of the puts and takes driving the underlying loss ratio in commercial and I guess, across the commercial subsegments? Christopher Swift : Mike, when you say puts and takes, compared to prior year, what do you have in mind? What are you trying to get at? Michael Ward : Yes. Well, I think last year, you had mentioned, I think, commercial -- Small Commercial was hotter. Just trying to see how the underlying is doing year-over-year. Christopher Swift : Yes. I would just share with you. From an expectation side, everything is pretty much right on line. I mean if you -- obviously, you could see we improved slightly on a loss ratio basis. From prior year our non-cat property is pretty consistent with prior year and maybe even slightly ahead of our expectations. So I don't want to avoid -- I don't want you to feel like we're avoiding a question, but there's nothing to call out. Michael Ward : Okay. And then maybe just on the loss trend. I know you said pricing was still ahead of loss trend. Just curious how loss trend assumptions if they're steady in the first quarter relative to, I guess, '23? Christopher Swift : Yes, I would say generally, our views on loss trends from '23 have increased modestly and that's obviously reflected in what we're trying to execute from a written rate side and the discipline we have there. And again, that the guidance that we try to give our underwriters with appropriate discretion, but yes, I would say loss trend is up modestly in '24 compared to '23. Operator : We'll move next to Brian Meredith at UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes. I was hoping, could you give us what your kind of E&S growth was in the quarter in your Commercial Lines space? And just maybe your thoughts, is that a market that you continue to expect to grow at a pretty healthy rate here going forward? Christopher Swift : Yes, Brian, I'll look to Mo to add any of his color. But I would -- there's two E&S components I'd have you think about. One is in Small, right? Our E&S binding business, which we've called out and we'd like to try to get to that $300 million level. And then, obviously, all our E&S capabilities within Global Specialty, whether it be property or casualty, that is an important component of what we're trying to do in the marketplace. But Mo, what would you add from an overall growth rate perspective? Adin Tooker : Brian, I would say we're excited about the flow in both of the channels that Chris talks about, both in that binding, which is the Small Commercial and the flow into our brokerage that continues to grow nicely. We saw -- we continue to see the growth, as Chris called out in his prepared remarks on the binding side. And we're seeing really good growth in the brokerage side, which sits in our Global Specialty business in both primary casualty, excess casualty, that rate environment continues to accelerate, as I talked about earlier. We're undersized in property brokerage and in Global Specialty, we're undersized in inland marine, we're undersized in auto. So we just see that, especially on the global specialty side, there's plenty of opportunity and the flow is there to support it. Brian Meredith : Great. That's helpful. And then second question, Chris, bigger picture question here. Looking at your Personal Lines business and understanding that the last couple of years have been challenging from inflation stuff, but if I look at your homeowners business, it's been close to a decade since you've grown unit volume there. In auto it's probably 6, 7 years, maybe a blip here and there. I'm just curious, maybe what kind of was going on during that period? And is the Prevail product kind of the answer to that now, where maybe at some point here, we'll see [indiscernible] start to grow unit in the Personal Lines space? Christopher Swift : Brian, I appreciate the question. I'm going to spare the torture going back 7, 8 years for everyone on what didn't go right. But I think more importantly, and we've talked about it in the various settings that, the Prevail product and platform does give us a step-change in our abilities to effectively compete in our core market, which is a mature preferred segment through an AARP endorsement that will allow us to be more competitive in auto, in home, and as much as I said, we do continue to expect PIF count, particularly in auto to decline this year by 4%. We've also talked about that we feel like we can start to grow PIF count modestly in '25, and then maybe more meaningfully in '26. So I think that's where we're at. We've made the investment. We're in 42 states. We should be in 46 by the end of the year and couple of other states will lag a little bit.  But I think it gives us every opportunity to be growth-orientated. And then we'll see where we could take the Prevail platform. Right now, it's obviously geared towards a direct response platform and channel, but maybe there's others that we would explore getting into at the right time. Once we finish off the implementation of Prevail in the vast -- or all the states feasible, we'll start to think about the future a little bit differently. But we want to take care of the core right now. We want to get it back to overall profitability, particularly in auto, and then we'll build from there, Brian. Brian Meredith : Got you. And on the homeowners, the geographic constraints, just given where a lot of your customers maybe as far as growth? Christopher Swift : No. I mean, we're obviously in all 50 states on minute basis. You know we paused our new homeowners in California, which is a writing new homeowners business until the regulatory reforms get enacted to allow us to match price and risk appropriately. So that's the only self-imposed constraint we had. There's no other constraint besides our long-standing not writing any new homeowners business in Florida since 15, 16 years -- almost 20 years ago, I bet. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Zaremski at BMO. Michael Zaremski : Did you comment on what drove the pricing increases in Commercial? I think it came from Global Specialty. Any color there, if that's a trend or just maybe something this mix one-off? Christopher Swift : Ask the question again, Michael, I don't think I understood you. Michael Zaremski : Sorry, the Commercial pricing, renewal written pricing increased ex comp from 8.3 to 9, I think that was driven by the Global Specialty segment. Could you comment kind of if there's a trend there that's causing pricing to move north? Christopher Swift : Yes, I would say that the components that are driving that is primarily global. Global had a good quarter. I'm looking at through my sheets and all the casualty lines, property lines, international rebounded in a good way. So that's what I would call out.  But Mo, what would you add? Adin Tooker : No. I think we are continuing to see moderation in the negative rates on public D&O. We're certainly seeing a shift in our portfolio towards more of the management and professional liability. So there's a mix coming through there, that's a part of it. I don't want to get too nuanced on you, but just that's the only additional detail I would give to Chris' comments. Beth Bombara : The only other thing I would add to that is when you look at the Small Commercial side, ex comp, definitely saw rate increase there coming from the Spectrum product. So again, obviously, workers' comp is a large portion of Small Commercial. But if you ex that out, that contributed to the ex comp growth as well. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful color. And I guess lastly, just not trying to nitpick, but the -- you mentioned in the prepared -- or in your comments, Chris, that a larger end of, I think, Small, more competitive, yet you're successfully accelerating growth on the business in Small Commercial. So any kind of color you'd want to offer there on those dynamics? Christopher Swift : Well, the only thing I'll say before Mo jumps in is, our Small Commercial franchise is world-class. Adin Tooker : Hard to build on that, but I will try. I think the nuance we're trying to strike for you is that there are competitive spots in the marketplace, and we're just really proud of how well our underwriters are navigating what is increased flow, and that increased flow doesn't come as all business that we want to write, and that's the same in Small, Middle and Global. The flow is up significantly in all three businesses, and we're just trying to get underwriters to really pick our spots, and that's what we're trying to call out, Mike. Thanks. Michael Zaremski : And I guess just is the Small -- you brought up E&S many times and there's different levels or different types of E&S, but it's been in your prepared remarks for a number of quarters. Is part of the E&S growth off of your Small Commercial chassis, which is kind of the world-class product? Or is it just -- is it totally separate type of underwrite platform? Adin Tooker : No, that's the beauty of the model, Mike. We're taking all of the strengths that we've had in the retail channel and applying the same business model to the wholesale channel, and that's why we're so excited. Operator : Next, we'll move to Yaron Kinar at Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : I think in your prepared comments and also in response to an earlier question, you talked about some of the pressure that you're seeing in the group life sales, just given your mortality expectations. That said, I think we're also seeing some slowdown in disability and voluntary. Can you maybe talk about the drivers for that slowdown? Christopher Swift : Yes. I'll just give you my point of view, and then I'll ask Jonathan to add. I don't think -- I think disability is performing exceptionally well, whether it be claim recoveries and terminations and getting people back to work. I think growth has been solid.  I'd say, I'm just wondering levels are behaving... Yaron Kinar : I was referring specifically to the top line, to the [ NPE ]. Christopher Swift : Yes. I'm giving you all the good stuff, and then I'll get to that. So again, I want you to feel like the book is healthy. And the top line, as I tried to address in my commentary, is a little challenged. Some of that is exceptional 2023 we had, but some of it is challenged, as we mentioned, due to our views on life insurance and how we're going to be disciplined there. Jonathan, you can give you additional color. So JB, what would you say? Jonathan Bennett : So Yaron, just a couple of things on there. In terms of the top line, '23, of course, was pretty exceptional on all the key metrics, the drive result. But I think we are seeing really strong results here even in the first quarter of 2024 comparatively speaking. But from a persistency standpoint, we still have book persistency in the low 90s, which is historically quite good. We're very excited about that. It was even higher a year ago. And I think that does reflect a little bit the competitive nature of the market and the more likelihood that a customer may, in fact, take a case or take their business out to market. So we're addressing all of that. I think we're working through those renewal challenges and being quite successful with it and very much picking our spots. .  On the new sales, also a bit more competitive in that market. We're excited adding new lines of coverage to existing cases. That's always important. And I think one of the best opportunities we have to continued sales growth is rounding that out. There can be a little bit of a downside with that, of course, in some cases, around voluntary as an example. It's a smaller set of lines if the bigger lines like disability move, perhaps voluntary goes with it.  So those kinds of effects in the marketplace as we're working through and addressing them, but we continue to have really strong results on supplemental health. And we've had some very exciting growth. It's a little bit more tapered right now, but an area that we continue to expand in and see a lot of big opportunities that trend into the future in 2024 and beyond, I can already see, continues to accelerate. So a place that we will stay focused and continue to deliver results. Yaron Kinar : And my second question, I want to make sure I heard, Chris, your comment correctly with regards to loss trends in personal auto. Did you say that they're currently in the low-teens or you expect them to be in the low-teens for '24? Christopher Swift : I was trying to do, compared to '23 to '24. Mid-teens in '23, low double digits in '24, or for the full year whatever I was just trying to say is that it bounces around from quarter-to-quarter. So I'd rather have you see the bigger picture trend that going from mid-teens down to even high double-digits is a pretty meaningful move. Yaron Kinar : And I guess the reason I'm asking this is it does seem to be a little bit higher than what we're seeing industry-wide right now? Is there something unique to the AARP book or to the policies that you're writing that, that would keep the loss trend a bit above maybe mid- to high single digits? Christopher Swift : I would just say our judgment and prudence is leading us to call that number where we sit today. And if it changes during the year, we'll let you know. Operator : Moving next, we'll go to Meyer Shields at KBW. Meyer Shields : I just had one question. I was hoping you could give us some guidance on how to think about how much lower the current Personal Lines expense ratio is compared to when you're in normal growth mode? Christopher Swift : So I would say on the expense ratio, I would have you think of the full year '23 compared to the full year '24 about being the same. Beth, I don't know if you would add any? Beth Bombara : Yes, I would agree with that. As we go through '24, you might see a slight uptick in Q2 because as we said, we are turning on marketing. And again, as the rate continues to earn into the book, that will start to level off. But our overall expectation right now for Personal Lines expense ratio, as Chris said, full year this year to full year last year will be relatively flat. Meyer Shields : Okay. Is it fair to think of it as being a little bit depressed just because of, I guess, the states where growth is, it doesn't make sense at? Christopher Swift : I don't think I understood the question. It was just hard to hear you. Meyer Shields : I'm sorry. No, I was trying to get a sense as to whether we should expect, we look out to whenever personal auto is normalized, that the expense ratio should be a little bit higher than where it's been running for the past couple of years. Christopher Swift : Not necessarily, right? I mean there's a volume issue, dollars and then a rate. So again, with the amount of rate we're getting the book, I think it's helping keep the ratio the same. We might actually be increasing dollars, which we are sort of in a J-curve model this year. But from a ratio side, that's why I tried to give you that full year number to sort of manage your expectation. Operator : And we'll move next to David Motemaden at Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Just a question on the expense ratio in Commercial Lines. 20 basis points year-over-year improvement, obviously, following a strong year last year. I was wondering, is there anything one-off or anything that prevented us from seeing more expense ratio improvement year-over-year? Beth Bombara : So if you're looking at just quarter 1 to where we ended last year, I'll just remind you that in first quarter, we tend to see a higher expense ratio just because of some expense items that hit more heavily in Q1.  When I think about Commercial Lines sort of full year this year for '24 compared to '23 expecting it to be relatively flat as we go through the year. Again, any 1 quarter, you can have some movements relative to bad debt reserve adjustments and things like that. But overall, we see it relatively consistent. Operator : And we'll go next to Bob Huang at Morgan Stanley. Jian Huang : Just maybe a follow-up on reserving. I think this is for rather Beth or Mo. When we think about the favorable reserving in workers' comp, just curious if there's a dollar amount that you can give us in terms of how favorable it was and how adverse general liability was? Beth Bombara : Sure. I'll take that. We actually have very detailed disclosures in our 10-Q and our IFS on that. So for workers' compensation, releases were about $67 million, and then we always have the workers discount accretion that comes in for 12 that goes offset against that.  And then general liability was 17, and marine was 7, and assumed reinsurance was 9. But you could go to Page 38 in our 10-Q, and it lays it all out for you. Jian Huang : Yes, sorry for that. I must [indiscernible] so that's totally my fault. So maybe just a follow-up on that. Can you maybe talk about the current reserving environment for workers' comp in terms of as we now 3 years out from COVID, are there's still quite a bit of favorable uplift, so to speak, post-COVID or do you think the workers' comp book from a reserving perspective is likely to kind of normalize back down to more of a pre-2019 environment? Christopher Swift : Yes. It's a complicated question, but I would say I think it's normalized. Obviously, during COVID, there were a lot of assumptions made as far as where trends were that obviously turned out to be prudent, but sort of 2 years out from sort of the official end of workers' comp, I think trends are behaving as we would expect.  Frequency continues to be positive. Severity is still within our expectations, which we always talked about, Bob, being a 5% trend, which, again, severity is behaving within that expectation. So yes, as I think about '23 and '24, with a lot of continuity and consistency in workers' comp trends. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Susan Spivak for closing remarks. Susan Bernstein : Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Susan Spivak : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on second quarter 2024 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all the earnings-related materials on our website. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. To start, we have Chris Swift, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Beth Costello, our Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will begin taking your questions.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for one year. I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Chris Swift : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford's second quarter results were outstanding, contributing to excellent financial performance in the first-half of the year. These results reflect the effectiveness of our strategy and ongoing investments to differentiate The Hartford in the marketplace. We remain focused on disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, expanding product and distribution breadth, developing exceptional talent and delivering a superior customer experience. Highlights from the second quarter include top line growth in Commercial Lines of 11% with strong renewal written pricing increases, and an underlying combined ratio of 87.4. Personal Lines' top line growth of 14%, with improving margins, an exceptional Group Benefits core earnings margin of 10%, and solid performance in our investment portfolio, all of these items contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. I'm also pleased to announce that with continued strong capital generation from our businesses, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3.3 billon. We will continue to balance growth, investing in our businesses, and returning excess capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Now, let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines produced exceptional results with double-digit top line growth in an underlying combined ratio below 90 for the 13th straight quarter. We are using our industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise, and data science advancements to drive profitable double-digit new business growth. Retention was steady, and the broader economic environment remains conducive for growth. In Small Commercial, with our unique and superior market position, industry-leading products, unmatched customer experience, and unrivaled pricing accuracy, we continue to deliver exceptional results, including strong top line growth and outstanding margins. New business premium was a record of 23% in the quarter, in part driven by a 36% increase in quotes, and nearly 90% growth in E&S binding, where we continue to see tremendous opportunity. With another quarter of exceptional results and relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our Small Commercial business. Moving to Middle & Large Commercial, second quarter performance was excellent, including double-digit top line growth, paired with a strong underlying margin. We continue to take advantage of elevated submission flow, driven in part by investments made to expand our product capabilities, and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution, along with double-digit new business growth, primarily in property and liability coverages. We have built a track record of delivering meaningful growth, while consistently maintaining underlying margins, a result we expect to sustain going forward. In Global Specialty, for the first time, we achieved over a $1 billion in quarterly written premium and maintained underlying margins in the mid-80s. Our double-digit top line growth reflects our competitive position, diverse product offerings and solid renewal pricing. Written premium growth was propelled by a 38% increase in global reinsurance, a 14% increase in our wholesale business with significant contributions from primary and excess casualty lines and double-digit growth in commercial and construction surety. We are particularly pleased with wholesale construction projects bound in the quarter, as well as overall increased submission flow, both meaningful drivers of new business growth. The Global Specialty business with our expanding position in the wholesale and reinsurance market, our broadened product portfolio and enhanced risk selection tools has developed into a meaningful profitable growth engine for The Hartford. As I've highlighted in the past, we continue to focus on property across Commercial Lines with written premium growth of approximately 20% in the quarter. We are capitalizing on favorable market conditions with a disciplined approach, including a stable and consistent catastrophe risk appetite. Turning to pricing, Commercial Lines renewal written pricing accelerated to 6.6% in the quarter, 9.5% excluding workers' compensation. Low teens pricing in auto and high-single-digits in general liability, including 14% in excess and umbrella is responding to societal trends. Overall, commercial property pricing has begun to moderate, but was strong in the low-double-digits. All in ex-comp renewal, written pricing and Commercial Lines remain comfortably above loss cost trends. Workers' compensation pricing remains slightly positive in the quarter. Before moving to Personal Lines, let me share a few comments we received at our recent annual agent summit. Our broadened product portfolio, increased cross selling opportunities and exceptional talent are resonating with the agent community opening up new business opportunities. Feedback confirms that the marketplace and our top agents recognize our evolution and strength. They appreciate our strong culture and capability to solve customer problems as a unified Commercial Lines team, particularly with small business customers where we are taking advantage of disruption and engaging more than ever with our largest partners to drive efficiency. Our investments in pace and technology were described as compelling and industry leading, and our talent strategy and succession planning was also complemented. Our exceptional Commercial Lines' first-half results and feedback from our partners makes it clear that we have the team, tools, and momentum to capitalize on market opportunities. Turning to Personal Lines, our second quarter financial performance demonstrates continued progress toward target margin improvement. Auto renewal written price increases remain very strong at nearly 24%. While below peak levels from last quarter, they remain consistent with our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year. As I have mentioned, we expect auto renewal written price increases for the year to be approximately 20%. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter, comprised of net rate and insured value increases, outpaced underlying loss cost trends. Investments in Personal Lines continued with the launch of dynamic pricing inside our TrueLane telematics offering earlier this month, an enhanced price to risk matching capability aligned with our Prevail product offering. As we return personal auto to profitability in 2024, capabilities like this, along with enhanced risk segmentation, near-term pricing gains, and moderating loss trend, position Personal Lines to reach target margins in 2025. Turning to Group Benefits, our core earnings margin was 10% for the quarter and 8.1% for the first-half of the year. These stellar results included a lower life loss ratio versus the prior year, and continued strong long-term disability execution. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2%, consistent with the first quarter, reflects strong book persistency, still above 90%, and sales of 546 million in the first-half of the year. Moving to investments, the portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic goals, performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details. From a macroeconomic standpoint, the U.S. environment continues to be supportive of the Hartford's businesses. The labor market has been resilient and with continued relatively low unemployment and wage rate growth, still in the 4% range, both of which positively affect our two largest and strongest performing lines, workers' compensation and disability. In summary, the Hartford delivered an outstanding quarter with sustained momentum heading into the second-half of the year, a testament to our execution, strategy, talent, and the impact of ongoing investments in our business. As I said before, we continue to build on our market differentiating capabilities in broad product offering, all while becoming more efficient. Our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, and innovative customer-centric technology are expected to sustain superior results. And we continue to proactively manage our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of the Hartford and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $750 million or $2.50 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. Commercial Lines had an exceptional quarter with core earnings of $551 million, written premium growth of 11%, and an underlying combined ratio of 87.4. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 86.8, further building on its impressive track record of delivering an underlying combined ratio below 90. Favorable non-cap property losses contributed to the strong results. Middle & Large Commercial also delivered outstanding results with 13% written premium growth. The strong underlying combined ratio of 89.6 reflects the positive impact of premium leverage, industry-leading pricing and segmentation analytics, and exceptional talent that continue driving profitable growth. Global Specialties written premium growth of 14% was driven by accelerating renewal written price increases and strong new business growth, including quarterly net written premium growth of 14% in our wholesale channel. The underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 85.2, relatively flat to the prior year. Written premium and Personal Lines increased 14% over the prior year, driven by rate execution. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 23.5% and earned pricing increases of 22.1%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 14.9% for the quarter and 14.6% on an earned basis. In Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 96.7 improved by five points from the prior year. Homeowners had another strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 77.8. We are very pleased with the improvement we are seeing in our auto results. Through June 30th, our underlying combined ratio of 104.7 was in line with our expectations and is 3.8 points lower than the prior year period, almost entirely due to improvement in the loss ratio. We remain on track to achieve the five to six-point full-year improvement in the auto underlying loss ratio as we have previously discussed. The total Personal Lines expense ratio increased by 0.7 points driven by higher direct marketing costs as anticipated. We have achieved new business rate adequacy in states representing approximately 80% of new business and our contemporary business model enables us to efficiently allocate marketing resources for growth in those states. With respect to catastrophes, TNC current accident year caps were 280 million before tax or 7.1 combined ratio points, which compares to 226 million or 6.2 points on the combined ratio in 2023. While catastrophe losses were significantly elevated for the industry, our results were only slightly higher than expectations. We continue to actively manage our CAD exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher risk states. Total net favorable prior accident year development within court earnings was $78 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, Personal Lines, and bond, which were partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance, and commercial auto liability. The increase to general liability reserves of $32 million was primarily related to accident years 2015 to 2019, with some modest increases in more recent years. We recorded $37 million before tax in deferred gain amortization related to the Navigator's ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. We have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck on both this ADC and the A&E ADC for your reference. Turning to Group Benefits, core earnings margin of 10% was exceptional. Results reflect strong Group life and disability performance as well as fully insured premium growth. The Group life loss ratio of 74.9 was 9.2 points lower than prior year due to lower claim severity. The Group disability loss ratio of 67.1 was essentially flat with 2023, driven by lower long-term disability claim incidents and a higher New York paid family leave risk adjustment benefit, offset primarily by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products. Fully-insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was consistent with first quarter and reflects positive exposure growth, albeit at a lower rate than in 2023 and strong book persistency at over 90%. Turning to investments, our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A plus and net credit losses remain insignificant. For the quarter, net investment income was $602 million. The total annualized portfolio yield, exclude limited partnerships was 4.4% before tax, slightly above first quarter. We continue to benefit from higher rates as evidenced by the second quarter reinvestment yield of 6.4%, up 30 basis points from our reinvestment rate in the first quarter and up 110 basis points from the year ago period. As expected, our annualized LP returns of 1.3% were consistent with the first quarter. Although we anticipate LP returns to be somewhat stronger in the second-half of 2024, the full-year is likely to be below 2023 results. However, we remain confident that over the long-term, LPs will generate returns consistent with historical levels. Turning to capital, yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of 3.3 billion which is 10% higher than the 2022 authorization reflecting the strong capital generation of our businesses. This authorization effective August 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026 is in addition to the existing authorization, which as of June 30 had approximately 650 million remaining. Over the last several quarters, our share repurchase activity has been very consistent at 350 million per quarter. With our new authorization in place, we would expect quarterly share repurchase activity to be closer to 400 million beginning with the third quarter. In summary, we are very pleased with our excellent financial performance through the first six months and these results demonstrate consistent execution in delivering profitable growth contributing to industry leading returns, thereby enhancing value for all stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak : Thank you, Beth. We now will take your questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the commercial pricing environment. Chris, you said, rates improve sequentially, and I think you attribute it to GL as well as excess and umbrella responding to societal issues. Given right, that we've seen, right, reserving issues emerge across the industry, would you expect that your soft pricing trends would just continue on an upward trend from here? Chris Swift : Thank you for the question, Elyse. I would say in general, we're very pleased with our pricing as we quoted 6.6%, up 30 basis points, 9.5%, up to about 20 basis points, even with some moderating property pricing, which you could talk about, but property still remains double-digit, but it's moderating. So, that leaves obviously the liability lines, which again, I'm very proud of our team and their ability to execute and get the needed rate to keep up with, and in most cases, stay ahead of our loss cost trends. So, that's a very important mission guidance that we talk to the team about monthly and quarterly. And I'm looking at Mo, I don't know if you would add anything special, Mo, but your team is doing a great job getting the needed rate, given the environment. Morris Tooker : No, I would echo that, Chris. The only additional data point I would give you Elyse is that our excess and umbrella rates were up 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter, so second quarter over the first quarter. So, we continue to work really hard at getting enough rate into the book to respond to the trends that we're seeing. So, Elyse, I don't think the environment is going to let up. So, you should expect us to continue to be disciplined in risk selection and disciplined in pushing for rate in the book. And whether that's at an increasing or a consistent pace, I'm not going to quibble with you, but we're going to be disciplined. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then, my second question is on the new authorization. Beth, and appreciate you gave us, right, the new quarterly kind of run rate on buybacks. Is the incremental uplift, is that all being driven by dividends, out of your property casualty entities? Or, I guess how should we think about the incremental cash flow over the next couple of years? Beth Costello : Yes, I would say it's really across our businesses. As we said, the fact that the authorization was increased from the previous authorization really is reflective of just the strong earnings generation. As you know dividends quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year can fluctuate a bit as we manage the various legal entities that we have. But we feel very good about the capital generation that we're seeing and we would expect to see our dividends reflect that. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, good morning. First question is around specialty, terrific, 85.2 underlying combined and 14% growth. Wondering if you could share with us, where you're growing, and particularly, I'm interested in the reinsurance area too. What lines of business you're looking at there too? Chris Swift : Andrew, thank you for joining us today. I would say our specialty business is quite diversified, but if I look at its biggest component, it's wholesale, E&S wholesale, which again uses the full range of our liability and property products. So, feel good about what we're doing there. Rates are strong. We've been increasing the rate that we're seeking on various aspects of that book particularly the liability books. So, again, new distribution relationships, we're expanding the wholesale distribution relationships. And as I said, it culminated in the first time ever going above $1 billion in rent premium. So, we feel really good about that. I'll make a comment on reinsurance and then ask Mo, if he wants to add anything. But our reinsurance business, I would say on a global basis is growing about 18%. I would say 45% of that global reinsurance business is about is property, which is growing at 24%. And then, our non-property casualty lines is growing at 12%. I think I've characterized this before, Andrew, this is going to be a run rate business for us of about $850 million this year. So, it's something that we're proud of. It's a niche. It's being very disciplined and taking advantage of dislocation in the marketplace and producing outstanding superior risk adjusted returns. Morris Tooker : Andrew, maybe I'll just add a little bit more on the wholesale in Global Specialty. I mean, I think overall, flow continues to be really strong in every product line. We continue to invest in the teams. The teams are executing really well. We are known for our construction casualty prowess. We are underweight in the other parts of wholesale and we're pushing into certainly property on a wider spread, marine. So, just know that we said there's more upside there. Andrew Kligerman : Yes, that's pretty impressive for a business that had a lot of doubters five years ago when you acquired it. So, my next question actually, you know what? Let me just sneak something in unless I get bounced out. That rate that you're talking, the pricing of 9.5% ex-workers' comp, is that pure rate, or is that also inclusive of exposure in terms of conditions and conditions? Morris Tooker : Yes. What we typically comment upon if there's a question is, we call it the exposure that access rate. I would say, of the 9.5 is about 2.2% this quarter, fairly consistent with prior quarters. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. I just want to make sure on that. And then, my other question is, I guess, reading about the reserves focusing on the more difficult adverse, 32 million in GL. That was off 16 to 19, and I think it said in the Q modest 21 to 23. So, that doesn't seem like an impact. Commercial auto was 10 million adverse in the quarter, but that was 2022. Anything we should read into that, Chris, or you feel pretty good about your reserving on the casualty lines and the commercial auto? Chris Swift : Yes, I'll let Beth add some detailed commentary, Andrew. But from my chair, knowing our management mechanisms quarterly, what we've debated, how we've picked, I think very, very appropriate loss trends over a five, six year period of time. The resulting balance sheet, I think is very healthy, high confidence. So, yes, these are the things that you work on every quarter and every planning cycle. And we pride ourselves on trying to be realistic and get it right, because if you don't, it has a cumulative effect of you're going to be chasing your tail as they would say. But Beth, would you add any further detailed commentary? Beth Costello : Yes. Well, I agree overall with your comments, Chris, as it relates specifically to the reserve increases that we took in commercial auto really related to a couple of accounts and feel really good that we've already taken action on those accounts. So, as you know, we look at our reserves in detail by sub line and where we think we see the need to make an adjustment, we will. But again, I'll echo Chris' comments. When we step back and look at it in total, we do feel very good about where we are. Andrew Kligerman : Awesome. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS Financial. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Thanks. First question just quickly. So, Chris, and Mo, there was some legislature placed in, I think recently passed in Florida talking about increasing Medicare reimbursements for doctors. And I know that, a lot of kind of workers' comp reimbursement schedules is kind of predicated on that. Can you talk a little bit about what the potential impact is on workers' comp, call it, severity trends are going forward? Are there offsetting factors? Maybe give us a little bit of explanation on that. Chris Swift : Yes, Brian, it's Chris. I would say, first, what did they pass? They passed the law that sort of effective January 1 of 2025. So, it does have some applicability for the back book. So, we think that's relatively modest for us. But as you said, it's really physician services across a broad range of services that they're getting basically a pay increase and a pay rate. So, I don't think it really moves the needle on anything materially in Florida. What we then need to do is obviously work with the rating bureaus to make sure that these loss estimates are getting into their guidance and obviously then making the appropriate rate filings and getting paid for that. So, it's a little bit of a lag, but I wouldn't say it's going to change anything from an underwriting appetite or execution. We just need to sort of make sure it gets into filings that the bureaus approve into our pricing, and we'll be off to the races. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks for the answer. And then, I guess my second question, Chris, you made this comment in response to one of Elyse's questions that property is still seeing double-digit rate. It'd be helpful maybe if you talk about, what it looks like from property rate, large account all the way down to small account because we've heard a lot more that large account is flat to getting more competitive right now. So, it was a little surprising when I heard, you say double-digit rate. Chris Swift : Yes, I would, I'm going to resist giving you competitive Intel, but I still want to address your question, Brian. So, I would say again last quarter, first quarter in aggregate, ex our Global Reinsurance Property business, we had rates going up 14.1% this quarter on a same basis like-to-like to 12.4%. And I would say that the highest rate increase that we're seeing across our portfolio is in our product for Small Commercial, our E&S binding division within Small Commercial. And then, I would say everything else is sort of in the high-single-digits. So, again, I think quite disciplined, quite appropriate in those lines of business, so I think again as I said the team is executing well. But Mo what would you add? Morris Tooker : Probably, I would just say we don't have a lot that we do in the shared and layered space. But in -- we have a little bit in our Middle and Large Commercial book of shared and layered and a little bit in our Wholesale Property and in Global Specialty. And that's the place we are seeing the most competition, where we rate a 100% in kind of middle market ratings, it's hanging in really well. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Gregory Peters : Well, good morning, everyone. So, for the first question, I think I am going to focus on the Personal Lines business. Chris, in your comments you said that you expect to hit the target margins in Personal Lines by 2025. Is that like end of the year 2025? Or, is the beginning of the year, or for the full-year? And I guess the reason why I am thinking about this is on slide 17 of your Investor deck, we are looking at the sequential trends in the auto underlying and the homeowners underlying combined ratio. And it looks like it ticked up a little bit sequentially from the March quarters. So, any color there on how you see that cadence developing over the next 18 months would you helpful. Chris Swift : Yes, happy to comment there. I would say just a couple of things, just context. Your sequential trend is primarily impacted by expense. I think we were pretty clear in our statements that particularly now that we are on a countrywide basis new business rate, and we turned back on marketing in a holistic way whether that would be T.V., whether it would be print, whether it would be paid, and whether it would be advertising and ARP, so data I would say is reverting back to normal. I would say again context, we ended 2023 with a loss cost trends in sort of the mid-teens, and we do expect and we said loss cost trends are moderating. But in essence on a full-year basis, we still think they are going to be low double digits. And that's what we are recording in our financial statements. And then, all I would say is from a target margin perspective, we still see '25 and I would say mid '25 we could get back to our target margins. And the five to six point improvement that we talked about this year, I think, we are on track for it. Particularly as we continue to earn and as loss cost trend continue to moderate in the second-half of the year, but Beth, what would you say? Beth Costello : Yes, I agree with everything that you said, Chris. One thing that I would point out when you look at the sequential underlying combined ratio in auto is just keep in mind that first quarter is typically our lowest loss ratio quarter. And we typically see a couple of points every quarter as we go through the year. So, when you put that into the mix combined with what Chris said about the little maybe less than 1 point of expense increase because turning marketing on, I think that shows you that we are making progress relative to that trend. You just have to take in the seasonality into consideration. Gregory Peters : That makes sense. Okay, for my follow-up question, I am in a pivot to the Benefits business. And I know you called out the 10% core margin results for the second quarter. Is that how we should think about what your objective is in that business over the course of the year? And then related to that, I was looking at some of the sales stats and your supplement, it looks like at least for the June quarter sales were a little bit down on a year-over-year basis. So, some color on the Benefits business would be helpful? Chris Swift : Sure. I would just start by saying we are very, very pleased with the 10% core margin and sort of 8.1% through the six months range which is above our 6% to 7% guide on a long-term basis. But I have always reminded people, Brian -- excuse me, Greg, that that guide is based on making rate guarantees over the next three - four years in certain cases for our products. So, you want to be thoughtful about what can happen over that period of time. But that said, we did call out mortality really improved this quarter. And that's great to see, particularly coming out of the pandemic. But we still believe we're sort of in an endemic state, that mortality would be a little higher over the next couple of years. But I would say we had an outsized benefit this time in the mortality. But everything else is performing well, disability continues to be very steady and a consistent performer. So, I would expect for the remainder of the year for us to continue to outperform our long-term guidance and obviously end the year above the six to seven. But I'm not going to comment on any specifics or any numbers at that point in time. And we'll see then what holds for '25. On the top line in sales, I'd like Jonathan to comment particularly on market conditions, which I generally describe and when he and I talk on a monthly and quarterly basis. I mean, the market is competitive. And I think that there's some impacts on our sales and top line there that we could talk about. But Jonathan, what would you add on premium and top line? Jonathan Bennett : I think those are the right comments, Chris. When we're thinking about competition right now, I would say it is heightened. We got in our marketplace a number of capable competitors, some of them relatively new entrants. And any one of them can have different business objectives based on their strategy. I can't speculate on that. And there's always room for reasonable people to have differing views on future loss trend. But our customers are quite sophisticated. Their needs are vast and differentiated. We compete on far more than price. We have absence management capabilities, digital tools, and deep customer focus are all things that distinguish the Hartford. So, when we put it all together, we think we're navigating the market quite well. We're adapting to competitive situations, competing for the business that we believe we want to obtain. We're maintaining underwriting and pricing discipline, which is crucial. We'd always like to be growing faster, but we're focused on the fundamentals of the business. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you very much. So, maybe not so surprising, or maybe it is for some, workers' comp continues to be favorable. Does that mean that when you think about the going forward margins, you are making changes to your current view of margins in workers' comp, and the loss picks are coming down in current years? Or maybe you're just skeptical that this favorability can last forever. How do you think about that actuarially, and how does that play into the stability or actually improvement in your commercial loss picks overall compared to a year ago? Chris Swift : Yes. Josh, Beth and I are a tag team here. I would generally say, again, when we entered this year to where we are today, we're virtually right on where we thought. And remember, we did make some commentary that we thought we would experience some modest margin contraction heading into 2024, and I would say that continues to be maybe less modest or more modest, depending on how you want to say it. But it's obviously a line that we know well and know the components. So, I think it's all working as expected. I'm sure between Beth and I, we could tell you that our frequency and severity assumptions are holding. Our wage inflation assumptions were probably a little light, and we're outperforming there. So, you put it all together, and it works. It's working. It's still a highly profitable line of business for us that contributes meaningfully. And yes, we're watching all the drivers of loss cost trends very, very closely, as you would expect a company of our expertise and skills in this area. But Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes, again, Chris, I agree with how you characterized it. And what I would say, Josh, is we take into consideration this is a long-tailed line. So, when we make our picks relative to loss trend, we take that into consideration. We obviously look at what's happening in the near term. But one of the areas I know we've talked about in the past is medical inflation. We still are holding that 5% trend in our reserves and our pricing. We've seen some, continue to see some frequency benefit, and we build some of that in as well. But we, our philosophy is we just need to be steady as we think about those loss trends. And then, obviously, we've been talking about what we're seeing on the rate side. So, that's why we're feeling a little bit of that compression. But we, again, understand this is a long-tailed line, and we want to be very thoughtful with our loss picks. Josh Shanker : Just to synthesize the two things you said. So, the pick is slightly higher, but that's pricing driven. Is that right? Chris Swift : No, I would say it's loss cost driven, impacted by the rate environment. So, when we said we're expecting some margin compression, our loss trends, which are generally consistent, are impacting, have the rate effect of pricing. So, when pricing continues to be sort of less than positive, and is not covering your cost of goods sold on an assumption basis, you're going to have some slight margin compression, and that's what we're feeling. Josh Shanker : Okay. So, that's actually where I want to go. But obviously, the numbers are getting better. So, in general liability, and I guess attritional property, are the initial picks improving at the backdrop of a little bit more caution on the workers' comp picks? I'm still trying to look at the moving pieces on where the trend is. Are things getting better right now? I ask this because arguably some of your competitors might have said things before you reported the quarter that give people the impression that things are getting worse. And yes, I'm trying to figure out if that's right or wrong. Chris Swift : Well, you're smart. You'll figure it out. But again, from the pure comp line, I would say it's steady. Josh Shanker : And then, the non-comp longer tail lines? Chris Swift : Now, again, those are very detailed conversations by product line. But I would characterize at least our views of where we're at and how we're executing. My view is I think we have appropriate and compelling loss trends baked into our picks going back five years. And our ability to execute on a rate side consistently and in those strong double digits, particularly in the liability lines, over an extended period of time puts us in a good place because I always comment every quarter that I think we're staying ahead of trend, loss trend, with our pricing. So, I'll look at Beth and/or Mo if they want to add anything additional. Beth Costello : Yes, I'll add a couple points. So, again, on the liability lines, as Chris has said, we feel very good about the loss trend that we've been building into our picks. And pricing has been above that, as well as the fact that we've been taking underwriting actions for a number of years, which also has the effect of sort of stabilizing those loss picks, so, all that feels very good. And then, the one area that we called out relative to performing slightly better than our expectations this quarter was in the non-cap property line, primarily in Small Commercial. And that line quarter-to-quarter, you can see some just normal volatility in that. But overall, I would say when you look at all of our loss picks and what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, things are in line with that. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much. I appreciate the detail in the face of my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe staying on workers' comp for a second, I don't know if you'd be willing to share maybe one level deeper here in a public forum. But I was curious to hear more about maybe each of the severity and frequency trends that you're seeing there and expectations there. I know that overall loss trends maybe moved up a little bit, but are still remaining below the long-term expectation. But we'd love to peel the onion a little bit if we could. Chris Swift : Yes, I think we said it pretty clearly, Yaron. I don't know what to say other than our 5% long-term medical inflation trend, or below that. We've said in the past that maybe medical trend is ticked up just a little bit from two-ish to maybe three-ish, which I think still applies. We never talked about frequency trends just because we don't. So, sorry to disappoint you, but I think we've given you enough. Yaron Kinar : Okay. No, I figure it would be worth a try. And then, maybe moving to Group Benefits, and I know I asked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it sounds like I'm harping on this. I don't mean to. I do think that as underwriters obviously the art is balancing between margin and growth. And considering just what seems to be like sustainable outperformance on the margin side, I would be curious to hear more about maybe why not give a little bit more on the pricing in order to achieve more growth. And I know that last quarter you talked about taking the life pricing up a bit because of the endemic expectations. But are you overshooting there? Chris Swift : No. Yaron Kinar : No? Chris Swift : Well and again, I'm looking at Jonathan too. Again, I understand, and we do art and science. But remember, particularly in this life area, generally these contracts are four to five to six year with rate guarantees. So, the margin for error there is really, really tight. And we don't want to have any errors. So, we don't want to have any whoopsies. So, that discipline is there. The disabilities generally, three year rate guarantees. So, a little different than sort of short, pale P&C businesses, which you get to reprice every six or 12 months. So, that's where the additional caution and mechanisms come into play when you're making those medium term commitments. But Jonathan, what would you add? Jonathan Bennett : Chris, only that I'd like it to be more like a dial. And I could turn it two clicks and I could trigger something to that effect. But Yaron, it doesn't really work that way. So, we get into, in particular, when you're in some of the larger market. The cases do have data credibility. We get a lot of information. We pour through that and we position ourselves to compete hard. So, there is no shortage of work on our part to be digging into that environment and to win those cases. And we'll keep at it. If we find ourselves off by more than we feel comfortable with, then we feel like the discipline of walking away is the right answer. And we'll continue to exercise that prudence. But make no mistake about it. We're interested in competing hard for the growth. And we will continue to work at that, staying true to our outlook on trend and our expectations and requirements for profitability as well. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. And here's no whoopsies. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Peter Knudsen from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Peter Knudsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just following up on comments and the prepared remarks about the Hartford's continued mix shift to property and maybe versus a prior comment about some pressure from workers' comp on commercial margins, could you talk a little bit about how that mix shift might help those margins and if that's potentially enough to offset any of that pressure? Chris Swift : Yes, I would share with you, Peter. Obviously, it depends on your view of loss picks. But generally, property is going to have a lower loss ratio, combined ratio than comp given its long tail duration. So, that's just the obvious. If you mix more of that in the overall portfolio of underlying combined ratio particularly will go down. I think we've talked about it in the past that we are willing to grow in property principally because we've made so many investments that allow us to compete thoughtfully and earn good returns with good risk management tools, with a diversified portfolio that doesn't have outsized CAT to it. So, again, it's just not just because we want to grow. I mean, we have to have the capabilities to. And we have worked really, really hard and invested a lot of time and energy over the last five years to put ourselves in a position to compete today to earn good risk adjusted returns. So, I think that's an important component. I think the other component I'll just give you is, I think we're on track to come close to $3 billion of written premium this year, which would be up from $2 billion couple of years back and growing nicely in sort of that 20% range, I think I said in my prepared remarks. So, you put it all together, and we're competing well in an environment where there's a lot of disruption and a lot of complexity, but we're able to navigate it because of the investments and skills and talented people we have in the building today. Peter Knudsen : Okay, great. Thank you. And just following up on a prior question, I know we talked about national account pricing, so I won't get into that. But national accounts did see large growth this quarter, a decent acceleration from the first quarter. So, I'm wondering if maybe you guys could just talk a little bit about the opportunity you're seeing there and what was driving that? Morris Tooker : Yes, Peter, it's Mo. The national accounts business, which is really our large casualty business with deductibles, I think the quarter-over-quarter compares to the sequential quarter is a hard compare because the renewal date is really different. That business has chunky renewal dates. So, I would think the year-over-year quarter compares a better one. But overall, we feel incredibly good about the national accounts book. That is a disciplined underwriting process. The teams are doing well. We want to grow it. We did win some new business in the second quarter, but I think the best compare is the second quarter of last year. Operator : And we have now reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Susan Spivak for closing remarks. Susan Spivak : Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions. Have a great day.

I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on third quarter 2024 earnings.

Chris Swift : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we discuss our results, I want to extend our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by Hurricanes Milton and Helene. These storms have been wide-ranging and devastating. In times like these, I'm especially proud of the Hartford's claims handlers, adjusters and leaders. Our team is working tirelessly to support every customer impacted by these storms. Turning to our results. The Hartford's third quarter performance is a powerful example of sustained financial excellence, even in the face of industry-wide elevated catastrophe losses, and liability severity trends. Our excellent performance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy and ongoing investments to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We remain focused on disciplined underwriting, pricing execution, expanding product and distribution breadth, developing exceptional talent and delivering a superior customer experience. Highlights from the third quarter include top-line growth in Commercial Lines of 9% with double-digit new business growth, strong renewal written pricing increases and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 88.6. Personal Lines top-line growth of 12%, with over 5 points of underlying margin improvement, an impressive Group Benefits core earnings margin of 8.7% and continued solid performance in our investment portfolio. All these items contributed to an outstanding trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. In addition, yesterday, we were pleased to announce an 11% increase in our common quarterly dividend payable on January 3, 2025. This is a continuation of our track record of annual dividend increases and another proof point of earnings power and strong capital generation. Now let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines continues to produce excellent results with strong top-line growth and an underlying combined ratio below 90% for the 14th straight quarter reflecting our industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise, and data science advancements. New business growth in small commercial and middle market was once again well into double-digits. Retention was steady and the environment remains conducive for growth. As I've highlighted in the past, the breadth of our product offerings, extensive distribution network, and strategic investments in technology allow us to provide comprehensive and tailored solutions, which gives us a competitive advantage with small-and-medium sized enterprises. Our emphasis on ease, simplicity, and speed ensures that our customers and distribution partners experience seamless interactions and quick response. The strength enable us to offer more precise and competitive pricing, enhancing our market position. Additionally, our product capabilities help us to support customers as their businesses grow. We expect to continue to gain market share, while maintaining highly profitable margins. A prime example of Hartford's SME market leadership is our small commercial business, which once again had an outstanding quarter with strong top-line growth and margins. New business premium was up 26% in the quarter, in part driven by a 31% increase in quotes and a doubling of E&S binding premium, a business where we continue to see tremendous opportunity. We take pride in our robust business system and associated insights, which drives our rate strategy and segmentation, giving us significant edge that's a challenge for others to match. With another quarter of exceptional results, and relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our small commercial business. Moving to Middle and Large Commercial. Third quarter performance was strong including 8% top-line growth, paired with an underlying margin that has consistently hovered around 90% or better for the past eight quarters. We continue to take advantage of elevated submission flow driven in part by investments made to expand our product capabilities and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution along with a 28% increase in middle market new business with growth across nearly all products led by property. We have built a track record of delivering meaningful growth, while consistently maintaining underlying margins, a result we expect to sustain going forward. In Global Specialty, we achieved excellent results with underlying margins in the mid-80s and a record quarterly earned premium approaching $850 million. Strong top-line growth reflects our competitive position, diverse product offerings and solid renewal pricing. Gross written premium growth of 9% was driven by a 17% increase in our wholesale business, including 10% in property as well as significant contributions from auto and excess casualty and global reinsurance. Across Commercial Lines, our continued emphasis on property expansion has resulted in premium growth of approximately 20% this quarter, putting us on track to achieve our full-year target of $3 billion. We remain confident in and continue to capitalize on market conditions that support earnings strong risk-adjusted returns through a disciplined strategy, while maintaining a stable and consistent approach to catastrophe risk management. As for pricing, in Commercial Lines, renewal written pricing excluding workers' compensation, of 9.5% was relatively consistent with the second quarter. Low teens pricing in auto and high single-digits in general liability are responding to societal trends. Umbrella and excess pricing was in the mid-teens. Overall commercial property pricing remained strong in the low-double digits with mid-to-upper teens property pricing within our small commercial package product. Commercial Lines overall loss trends are stable with some moderation in both property and financial line severity, offset by higher severity in liability. All in, ex comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remained above loss cost trends. Workers' compensation pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. Turning to Personal Lines. Our third quarter financial performance demonstrates continued margin improvement. We saw a seven point improvement in the auto, underlying combined ratio and are on track to achieve target margins in mid-2025. Auto renewal written price increases remained very strong at approximately 20%. Pricing declines from peak levels remain consistent with our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. Turning to Group Benefits. Our core earnings margin was an impressive 8.7% for the quarter. Continued strong group life results and long-term disability execution are the primary drivers. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2%, consistent with the first half of the year, reflects strong book persistency still above 90% and sales of $105 million in the quarter. Moving to investments. The portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details. Before I turn the call over to Beth, I would like to share some insights from this year's Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers Annual Conference. Last year, we provided an update on CIAB where the strength of our franchise was a consistent theme. This year, our partners amplified that strength, highlighting our innovative digital tools, comprehensive product offerings, and our robust innovation agenda. They praised our consistent strategy and execution over the years. Additionally, they expressed a strong desire to expand their business with us viewing our team as best-in-class and noting that our relationships have never been stronger. In summary, the Hartford delivered an excellent quarter, a testament to our execution strategy talent and the impact of ongoing investments in our business. As I've said before, we continue to build on our market differentiating capabilities and broad product offerings all while becoming more efficient. Our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer centric technology are expected to sustain superior results and we continue to proactively manage our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of the Hartford in our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $752 million or $2.53 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. Commercial Lines had an excellent quarter with core earnings of $534 million, written premium growth of 9%, and an underlying combined ratio of 88.6. Through the first nine months, the underlying combined ratio of 88.1 is in line with the prior year and our expectations. Small Commercial continues to deliver outstanding results with written premium growth of 10% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.3, slightly better than the prior year. These results were driven by favorable non-CAT property losses somewhat offset by a higher loss ratio and general liability, both within our packaged product. Middle & Large Commercial delivered strong results as written premiums rose 8% and new business growth accelerated. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 90.2 compares to 88.1% in the prior year, reflecting a level of non-CAT property losses more consistent with our expectations compared to favorable experience in the prior year and an increase in the general liability and auto loss ratios, partially offset by a shift in business mix towards property line and the positive impact of premium leverage on the expense ratio. Global Specialty results include written premium growth of 9% and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 85.3. The underlying combined ratio increased one point over the prior year quarter primarily due to a higher loss ratio in global reinsurance driven by losses in Latin America, where we have taken underwriting actions to reduce our exposure to these risk profiles and a higher expense ratio compared to prior year due to a higher commission ratio driven by changes in mix of business. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 12% over the prior year, driven by rate execution. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 20.8% and earned pricing increases of 22.7%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 15.2% and 14.8% on an earned basis. In Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 93.7 improved 5.3 points from the prior year. The homeowners underlying combined ratio of 75.4 improved 2.7 points primarily due to the impact of double-digit earned pricing outpacing loss costs, partially offset by a higher expense ratio. We are very pleased with the progress in our auto results. For the quarter, the auto underlying combined ratio of 101.5, improved seven points from 108.5 in third quarter 2023. Through September 30th, the underlying combined ratio of 103.6 is 4.9 points lower than the prior year period, including 5.3 points of loss ratio improvement. The Personal Lines expense ratio of 25.6 increased 1.4 points, primarily driven by higher planned direct marketing costs and higher incentive compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premiums. P&C current accident year CAT were $247 million before tax or six combined ratio points, which compares to $184 million or 4.9 points on the combined ratio in the prior year period. We continue to actively manage our CAT exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline. Additionally, we have a robust and comprehensive reinsurance program on both a per occurrence and aggregate basis. As a reminder, we have a $200 million aggregate cover, which attaches when subject losses and expenses exceed $750 million. Through September 30th, catastrophe losses subject to treaty were $660 million, leaving $90 million before we reach the attachment point. The aggregate cover does not include losses from the Global Reinsurance business, which purchases its own retrocessional coverage. Our estimated losses for Hurricane Milton are in the range of $65 million to $110 million pretax, which includes $25 million to $40 million for Global Re. Therefore, at the high end of the range, we would be just under the aggregate attachment point. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $24 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation and personal auto physical damage partially offset by reserve increases in general liability and commercial auto liability. The increase in general liability reserve of $32 million reflects a higher frequency of large losses including losses in more recent accident years. We continue to monitor liability trends closely, making minor adjustments to our underwriting and pricing strategies, including adjustments that are incorporated in our current year loss pick. We recorded $26 million before tax of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. As a reminder, we conduct our annual asbestos and environmental study in the fourth quarter. We have $62 million of coverage remaining on the A&E ADC, so any development over that amount will impact core earnings. Turning to Group Benefits. We had another strong quarter with a core earnings margin of 8.7%. Results demonstrate ongoing strength in group life and long-term disability along with growth in fully insured premiums. The group life loss ratio of 77.5 improved by 2.7 points compared to prior year due to lower mortality. The group disability loss ratio of 67.9 increased 60 basis points due to a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products, largely offset by a favorable change in the long-term disability recovery rate assumptions. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was consistent with the first half of the year, and reflects positive exposure growth and strong book persistency at over 90%. The group benefits expense ratio of 25.3 increased 1.3 points from the prior year third quarter primarily due to higher staffing costs, including higher incentive compensation and benefit costs and increased investments in technology. Turning to investments. Our diversified and growing portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains strong with an average credit rating of A+ and no net credit losses in the quarter. For the quarter, net investment income was $659 million. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4.5% before tax, 10 basis points above second quarter. We continue to benefit from higher rates, security selection, and accretive trading activity as evidenced by the third quarter reinvestment yield exceeding the sales and maturity yield by 110 basis points. As anticipated, our annualized LP returns of 3% were higher than the first half of the year as private equity and real estate performance continues to improve. We remain confident that over the long-term, LPs will generate returns consistent with historical levels. Turning to capital management. As Chris mentioned, we increased our common quarterly dividend by 11%. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the fourth quarter. In summary, we are very pleased with our excellent financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of the year. We believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns thereby enhancing value for all our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Susan. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Two questions here. The first one, general liability, the increase in loss picks this quarter, was there any kind of current year development in that increase in the underlying loss ratio in commercial this quarter? Chris Swift : Brian, thanks for the question. I'll let Beth answer that. But I think I just would want you to have a little context on what we saw this quarter that required that $32 million adjustment. And I really would say it's just two simple things. Our data is just simply showing more attorney representation claims of all sizes. So the percentage of claims coming in with attorney representation is high and is getting higher. And we talked about it in the past, the average settlement rate of claims or the dollars that we're paying for average claims, including sort of simple slip and falls is increasing rapidly. So you put that -- those two components together, and that's ultimately why we adjusted our prior year. Beth, I think you could provide a little bit more detail. Beth Costello : Yes. Thank you, Chris. So Brian, on your question on the increase that we recorded in the current year for liability in the quarter. Yes, that would include some true-up for the first and second quarter. So I would quantify that, if you think about in the quarter, we probably booked a little bit over a point from the prior year and two-thirds of that would relate to the first six months. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. And then on that, Chris, just kind of how are you thinking about given what you're talking about with GL development, obviously going up a little bit. Does it make you pause at all about some of the new business that you're putting on and the growth you're putting on in the middle market area to kind of make sure that you're adequately capturing what kind of real trend is looking like in your pricing and terms and conditions in that business? Chris Swift : Yes, I would just say simply, no, we're very confident in the new business that we're putting on I'm looking at MO, he could give you a little bit of the history lesson that we've talked about. And really, the improvement that we've made in our data science, our analytics, our pricing tools, our segmentation and all that improvement we've made in the book. And I still feel good about where we're at MO. I don't know if you would add anything else. Morris Tooker : Brian, a couple of additions. I mean, I think we've talked to you a lot about the work that we've done, especially in middle and large commercial and global specialty to reduce in some of the areas that we were worried about. So we've been working on limits management, we've been working on jurisdictions. We've been working on kind of the underlying fleet sizes and certainly a lot of rate. And I think that's paying off. You look at our frequency of claims, it's down. And it has been -- when you look at the '20 to '23 versus the prior years, your frequency of claims is down, so it's paying off. What we're seeing is, to Chris' point, where there the lawyers are involved, it's down less. And so we watch this environment in real time. And we've got higher pricing standard for all of the Commercial Lines underwriters in certain jurisdictions in certain classes. So we feel really pretty good about our ability to execute through this. We're watching it closely. And maybe a little bit of context to finish with the growth that we've put on over the past three years, our nine-month underlying combined ratio is right on where it was last year, and we think that's an evidence of us executing pretty well on our pricing strategies. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gregory Peters : Well, good morning everyone. I'm going to -- the first question, I'll focus on the Personal Lines results. With the improvement gradually emerging, I'm just curious how you think about your longer-term combined ratio target in the Personal Lines business? I know some of your competitors have very specific numbers in terms of like 96 or 95 or et cetera. So maybe you could provide some perspective on where you think that's going to go to? Chris Swift : Greg, it's Chris. I would, I'm going to reframe from giving you exact targets other than what we've always talked about of getting back to overall profitability back to our targets. And that's roughly our 15% to 17% ROE that we're targeting. That does have a corresponding combined ratio, including CAT load even in for auto. So I'm going to just kind of hesitate a little bit about just dumping out a number just because -- that's the first priority is that we want to continue to improve our profitability. We're about 85% of the states in the country rate adequate now. So we're feeling good about getting the rate that we need into book and executing to that. But I'm going to pause on and giving you any targets especially for next year. Gregory Peters : Okay. That's fair enough. I guess I'll just come at it from a slightly different angle just on, if I look at the homeowners business, the underlying improvement in the combined ratio, there was some, but if I look at the rate slide that you put up in your supplement, mid-teens types of rate increases that you're getting in homeowners consistently quarter-after-quarter. I guess I'm surprised that the underlying combined ratio has improved more. So maybe you could provide some perspective on that. Chris Swift : Yes. Actually, I think we feel really good about where our overall trends are in homeowners, both from an attritional side and even a CAT side, we're pretty close to hitting our target margins there in total, Greg. So I don't know how to respond to your sort of disappointment, but loss cost trends are increasing. That's why we are putting the rate in there. Attritional is behaving. And obviously, CAT was elevated during the quarter, and it's a little elevated for the full-year in homeowners. But overall, it's still like what we're doing with that book of business and particularly with our new product and chassis, we call prevail that I know you're familiar with. It's -- I think it's performing very nicely from a new business side. I'm looking at Melinda Thompson, I'll just ask Melinda, would you add any color? Melinda Thompson : I think you covered it well, Chris. The only thing I would add is that as you look at the rate and increases to value that we put into market, we feel that they're comfortably ahead of loss trend. Gregory Peters : Okay. Fair enough. I wouldn't characterize my questions as disappointment, just trying to understand the numbers. But thanks for your answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Good morning. Yes, looking at the commercial net written premium, pretty solid growth, 10% in small, 8% in mid-large, 9% in specialty. And then when I looked at the rate increases that you described, and I backed in workers' comp. But back of the envelope, I get about 3% policy in force growth. Could you talk about the ability to gain share and maybe each of those three components of commercial and the outlook for growth there? Chris Swift : Yes. How about if we tag team. I'll start and MO, you could add your color. I would say, across all the commercial, Andrew, we're just really pleased. You could look at small and see sort of the quotes up. We're cross-selling more of our global specialty products into there. We're growing E&S very rapidly at strong margins. Likewise, with large and small commercial submission flows up, hit rates are relatively stable. But again, all the investments we've made in our pricing, our data science, everything we just talked about, I think is paying off. And then Global Specialty, particularly the wholesale division there, which is our main E&S chassis, it's performing at a high level. It's growing rapidly with some of our most highly partnered E&S brokers. So I put it all together, MO, and I mean we feel good. And as I said, we're still in an environment, Andrew, that I think is very conducive to growth, whether it be in the standard lines or the E&S lines and I believe we are taking market share with our differentiated capabilities. But MO, what would you add? Morris Tooker : No, just maybe to reinforce a couple of points. I mean I think, Andrew, the flow in all three businesses, as we've talked about in prior quarters, remains strong. As Chris was talking about, the pricing environment is, we think, conducive supportive. I would say the pricing environment is largely consistent with what we talked about last quarter, and then that's a good environment. You won't see us growing workers confident. You asked specifically about workers' comp. You don't feel it's growing that at a much different pace. It's basically a flat in the quarter from a written premium perspective, and maybe just to build on Chris' CIAB point, coming out of that meeting, it gave us great confidence that those flows to us will continue. And we feel really good that with those opportunity flows the way our underwriters and sales teams are executing that will take advantage of it. Andrew Kligerman : Excellent. And shifting over to Group Benefits. You again came in at a compelling margin of 8.7%, well above your 6% to 7% guidance. Can you talk about kind of the trajectory of going back to that level and the competitive landscape that you're seeing in group benefits. Chris Swift : Yes. I'll start, Andrew, and then I'll ask Mike Fish to add his market color. I would say I'm pleased with our performance in total whether it be on the margin side or an underwriting side, sales are down a little bit, 15% from prior year, but we sort of signaled that we thought we were operating in a highly competitive environment. And that we might have a different point of view on mortality trends where we're still pricing for endemic state, which you could see in our numbers, our life sales are down a little bit. I'm really pleased with a lot of the new products that we're bringing to market, particularly in the absence area and all our paid family and paid medical lead products that is having a little bit of a compare challenge between years where we had a lot more new business opportunities and paid family medical leave that are not run ratable going forward. But Mike Fish, what would you add as far as your market color? Mike Fish : Chris, I would add just a couple of comments there. It's a competitive market. And -- but I'd also say our new business activity is strong. So our sales team is active in the market. With our brokers, you noted on the life side, pricing for that endemic state. So that is putting a bit of pressure on the new life sales front. But I'd end by saying our persistency is strong. We're still well north of 90%, which is on the high end of the historical range. And really, we're looking to avoid situations where price is the only driver. And we're going to compete fiercely when we have an opportunity to sell our product and service capabilities. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. I guess just a follow-up on that last one. Like obviously, first quarter, pretty big renewal on the group side. Things are more competitive. But what does that mean in terms of what we should expect for pricing at this upcoming renewal. ChrisSwift: Ryan, it's good to hear your voice. I would say the 1125 particularly from a national account perspective, is largely done. We'll give you a little bit more color on our next quarterly results. But I feel good about them where we're at and how we compete it, how we're differentiating ourselves with some of our service capabilities. So that's all I'm going to say right now until we just officially close out the year. But it is, I guess, a competitive market. I said it, Mike Fish has said it and we're trying to pick our spots where we think we could make good margins over a longer period of time with appropriate rate guarantees. Inherently, there is some conservatism in our pricing when you think of three to four to five year rate guarantees. So -- but again, generally, very, very pleased. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I guess just a follow-up. Thinking about group disability, we've obviously been in a volatile macro environment. I mean, to what extent have you seen any new trends emerge this year from a claims perspective on the disability side. I mean have you? Or has it just kind of been more of the same as what you saw in '23 going to? Chris Swift : Yes. I would say more of the same. There isn't anything to call out. I mentioned our absence in paid family leave and medical plan. So we're in six states. We'd like that product line. It's very complementary to what we're doing with disability. It's actually a product line that consumers are more aware of and are using it and employers value it. So that's probably the only new thing, I would say, over the last two or three years' worth calling out at this point in time, Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Bob Huang : Hi, good morning. Maybe one on workers' comp. So on reserving, it looks like workers' comp release has been the highest over the last seven quarters. As we look at the post-COVID cohort start to age a little bit, can you give us maybe a little bit of color on how that book is developing. Should we expect similar level of reserve releases or reserve development rather going forward from that part of the book? Chris Swift : I'll let Beth add her color, but I would say less or more and more, we're making less of a distinction between COVID years, post-COVID, pre-COVID and just running it, I'll call it in an aggregate basis and looking at aggregate trends. But Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes. What I would say is on workers' comp as it relates to and this relates to all of our reserves, we evaluate them every quarter, and we'll make adjustments accordingly. But I can't offer any predictions on what reserve development would be in the future. As it relates to years' post-COVID, so I think it's sort of '21, '22, '23, those reserves are still very young. And so as typical, we wait to see how those season before we would start to make any adjustments. Bob Huang : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. But maybe one other thing on workers' comp really is the weaker or perhaps even a negative pricing environment. As you think about the business going forward, it's still incredibly profitable. What are some of the key focuses that we should really look into? Are you also -- are you really worried about the rising medical cost inflation, things of that nature around workers' comp? Chris Swift : Yes. I would share with you, there isn't really anything new. I think everything that you talked about, we would say the trends are generally stable, particularly on the medical severity side. We're still within our assumption of 5% from a long-term side. It could bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, but the overall trend, I still think is encouraging. And as you said it, I mean, it's a highly profitable line particularly for those that lead the industry, which we think we're one of the leaders in the industry. So yes, we'll be selective on new business and going to be sensitive on states that are maybe taking bigger price adjustments going forward. But from an overall side, we still like it. It's contributing mightily to our earnings growth and profile. And generally, we feel good on all the assumptions that we manage to, Beth. But is there anything you would call out? Beth Costello : No, I think you covered off on all of this. Bob Huang : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the underlying loss ratio in Commercial Lines. If I take out the current year prior quarter, still looks solid at 56.6 or 56.7, that sort of range. Was there anything else in there that you would characterize as being one-off or unsustainable either way? I know there were a few moving pieces between small commercial and middle market and large with the non-CAT property losses. But I just wanted to make sure I understand the baseline here. Thank you. Chris Swift : Yes. I'll ask Beth to provide any her insights, David. But I would say -- and I put our expense ratio in there. We come up with 88.1 through the nine months, which we feel terrific about. MO mentioned that before. That means we're executing well. It's generally consistent with prior year that we've talked about. I would say from a macro side, we feel good about the non-CAT property losses this year. I would say maybe they're just slightly ahead of our expectations and then offset by some of the GL movements that we've made there. But you put those two pieces together and still come up with an 88.1 with the fourth quarter to go. Yes, the team feels really good about that, David. But Beth, what would you say? Beth Costello : Yes, David, the only thing I'd point out, which you referenced was when you look at all-in on commercial lines, a little bit of favorability in non-CAT property primarily in small commercial. But I mean we're talking about tens of basis points here, nothing significant that I would call out. David Motemaden : Okay. Yes, that's helpful. Nothing big there. Okay. Thanks for that. And then not big numbers, but commercial auto also continues to develop adversely. I know, Beth, last quarter, you spoke about those reserve increases being related to a few specific accounts. I guess, was it the same story this quarter what sort of -- would it -- what would it take for you guys to like a step back and think about if some of those trends that are impacting a few accounts would start to be more pervasive across the book. Beth Costello : Yes. So I would characterize what we saw this quarter is very consistent with last quarter. So again, on some specific accounts within certain lines. And I'll just remind you that we increased our loss pick on commercial auto in the fourth quarter of last year, just addressing sort of the more macro trends. And so when we look at where we are with the current year, we feel very good with our loss picks and feel that we've incorporated some of sort of the broader, I would say, market impacts. But MO, would you add anything else? Morris Tooker : Yes. Maybe just, David, from an underwriting perspective, I think we've talked about it, but -- we've certainly been managing accounts that were impacting us, and these are accident years '22 and '23 as a reminder. We've been either moving them to loss sensitive if they got a larger fleet. We're moving them out altogether. Certainly, we're pushing rate and continue to push rate hard in the auto lines. And just maybe the last piece is the only place we really have any heavy trucking exposure is in our wholesale book, it's less than $150 million. And we're very transactional in that space. So I think we really feel good about the underlying auto exposure across Commercial Lines. David Motemaden : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Zaremski : Hey, good morning, thanks. And I just want to preface clearly, the results overall are excellent, but we're going to get a lot of questions on general liability. So I wanted to focus another question there. In the prepared remarks, you gave us good color about more Attorney rep on all claims sizes. Is there any way you could kind of parse it out more? Because I think that what we're seeing in the industry is that the -- on the small commercial side more so than the large commercial side, we're seeing more -- the loss trend rise more so than in the large account space because there's just more Attorney involvement. I've learned historically on larger clients, like larger Fortune 500 clients. So I just wanted to better understand if you are seeing the higher GL trends in any specific pockets based on account size or maybe type of employer or business that could happen. Chris Swift : Mike, all I would say, yes, there's lawyers everywhere. All 50 states, all the territories, obviously, looking for clients in which way they can from advertising or 1-800 numbers. So I'm being fastidious obviously, because we don't see any discernible trend. I think the -- what we called out and what we're reacting to is the more higher percentage of claims coming in the door with Attorneys already in tow, and that's driving up overall settlement rates no matter what business, what country or state and that's what we see. But MO, anything from the underwriting side, you would comment upon. Morris Tooker : Well, I would say, and I don't think we should need to get into the details, but just know that we're deep in every jurisdiction, we're in by class, we're in by the type of accident. So I think there's a lot of nuance here but Chris' overall point, there's more lawyers around, but certainly, when we get to the underwriting, we're tailoring it by industry, by state, by county, and certainly, any underperforming areas are getting the necessary rate action and book management activity. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just switching gears a bit to the overall commercial rate environment. It feels like the industry is being extremely disciplined. We're seeing pricing increase a bit in many lines despite overall industry return on equity levels being healthy to excellent. Would you say that the pricing environment is really being driven more by loss ratio and your folks and your peers aren't really taking into account the investment income benefit as much as I think maybe some investors thought would take place in recent years? Just kind of curious about the competitive environment. Chris Swift : Yes. I would say, again, Mike, I think it's rational and thoughtful and principally driven by loss trends, right? I mean I can't speak to any other competitors and how they really think or manage. But at least from our side, I mean, we start with trends, and we've always said we're trying to hold margins where we're at today. Underwriting margins feel good that, again, we're generally consistent with last year, and we'll start to talk about '25, a little bit more. But we don't -- from an underwriting side, we don't think about net investment income. All our metrics are sort of elastic except when you get into maybe the national account book of business that does have a little bit more float there. But I think it's primarily loss cost-driven MO and we're executing to what we're trying to do from a consistency perspective. Morris Tooker : Yes. But Mike, that doesn't mean it's easy. I just want to make sure you understand, it's a difficult underwriting environment. And if you don't give the right tools to underwriters, if you aren't making investments in the data science and the feedback loops to see the stuff, you're going to miss it. And so I just want to make sure we are talking about the difficult choices underwriters are making every day. And I think our team is doing a terrific job navigating the market. Michael Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I guess, going into -- on the premium growth side, within middle and large growth did slow a little bit in the quarter. And I know it was a little -- an easier comp last year, especially right when I look at growth within the middle market right around 7% this quarter, a little lower what we saw so far year-to-date. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you were seeing there in the quarter and how we should expect that to trend from here? Chris Swift : Yes, Elyse, you're right on. We certainly commented on July last year, the market just didn't come our way. But we're really excited about -- I think our year-to-date growth in middle and large commercial is 9.9%. We're really excited about that. As we talked about a minute ago, the flow continues to be really strong. Our underwriters are active in the marketplace. And again, coming out of CIB, I use that as a reference point since it's so recent. I think our agents are really talking about their desire to consolidate carriers and that would -- we would benefit from that in the middle and large commercial space. So I think as long as we can get paid for risk and the market holds up, we feel really good about the growth possibilities in the middle and large commercial. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then I just want to come back to GL for a second as well, right? So we saw adverse development right on some more recent years this quarter, last quarter was some softer here. It sounds like it was just, Chris, the Attorney representation that you were talking to that kind of was the driver of both. Can you just -- and I know you touched on it in prepared remarks, give us a sense of the severity kind of assumptions that you're assuming within GL. And is there like a buffer that -- like give us a sense of the buffer you have on top of kind of what you're seeing just so we can -- that you would expect not to see additional movements from here? Chris Swift : Yes. I would share with you, Elyse, and thanks for the question. I'm not going to talk about buffers or how we manage sort of in total. But yes, you're right. The data that we're reacting to this quarter is rep rates and settlement rates particularly on our bread and butter small commercial and middle market accounts, slip and falls, particularly, that type of claim seems to have the most explosive growth in settlement values there. So I think that's the color that I would provide, Beth, but would you add anything else? Beth Costello : No, I think you covered it well. I mean, we reacted to what we saw and incorporated that as well as our projections for what we would see going forward. The adverse development that we took in '22 and '23 and then how that informed our view of changing our pick for '24. So from our perspective, we've taken all of those inputs in and made our best call. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. [Indiscernible] on for Meyer. Just have a question on personal lines expense ratio. Head tech pick up year-over-year, but has declined sequentially. Anything you see from last quarter in terms of resume marketing or just seasonal finance. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. Thank you. Chris Swift : Yes, I think the expense ratio, there's nothing to call out. I think last quarter, we called out we were started or restarted our national advertising and solicitation through -- for our direct response business. I'd expect it to normalize and go down over time, particularly as we have more operating leverage as we start to grow again. So that's about it. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. My second question is on E&S growth. You previously targeted $300 million in E&S binding by end of the year. Could you provide an update on the progress and discuss with the social inflation driving more submission to the E&S channel? Chris Swift : Yes. I think the overall trend of E&S continued to be a meaningful channel for both casualty and property products is very strong. Obviously, they're capturing more of the flow on the small side in the middle market side, we're happy to participate with what we think is a pretty good offering and a pretty good mousetrap. We're on track to achieve our $300 million goal that we set this year, particularly in small commercial E&S binding. And it's an important channel for us to continue to develop capabilities and underwriting skills to support over the long-term. But Mo, would you add anything? Morris Tooker : No, I agree with everything on E&S binding, and I would just reinforce, we're seeing the same momentum in the wholesale space within Global Specialty and in property and inland marine in construction and casualty in total. So we feel really good about the progress in both segments. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joshua Shanker : Thank you. I'd like to talk about group benefits if we can change the subject. How is everyone doing this morning? Chris Swift : It's good to hear your voice, Josh. What is on your mind? Joshua Shanker : Good to hear. I want to talk about the sales growth looked a little weak year-over-year, but these are a lot of times multiyear sales cycles. So the year-over-year comparison might not be apt. And of course, the first quarter is more important than the third quarter. But can we talk a little bit about sales conversion, given a number of companies -- a number of companies coming from renewal, how well you did this year and what that augurs for in the future, especially maybe how many contracts are coming up for renewal in '25? Chris Swift : Yes. We're not going to talk too much about '25 right now, Josh, but we'll give you plenty of color once it's all tidied up. I would say, and Mike Fish will add his perspective, we still feel good about obviously, our sales team and what we're able to do in the marketplace and all our broker relationships. I mean it's quite an ecosystem that you have to manage with feet on the street and relationships. And when we get a lot of opportunities, I think the comp issue that I talked about, we had some onetime PFL and PML sales last year. So that's distorting it. If you take it out, we're still down, but we're down just slightly. And Mike, I don't know what you would provide to Josh to give him comfort that we're competing every day as hard as we can. But we're also trying to make money and we're being disciplined with our pricing also. Mike Fish : Yes, Chris, those are the right points. I'd just add a couple of items here. On the renewal side, Think of it this way, a little under a third of our book comes up for renewal every year, and I noted earlier in my comments around this year's persistency north of 90%. Now that's on the whole book. So renewal is a subset. But again, I think that just speaks to the fact that we're able to compete certainly on our in-force and keeping those customers. On the new side, our volume of quotes that we're seeing is consistent year-over-year. What I would sort of -- if I double-click under that, when you look on the larger end, those opportunities can ebb and flow over the years. And essentially, when we're looking to line-up with our underwriting appetite, we're going to be a bit more selective on the large end. But again, I don't think there's anything you need to note this year, very consistent with what we've seen in the past years. Joshua Shanker : Well, I just want to take your comment, Chris, is that we are here to make money, and I think that's right. You definitely are making money in the group around this business. The margins are fantastic. Is that showing up not necessarily in the Hartford, but in competitors, cutting prices at this point, being willing to tolerate a higher benefit ratio than they might have a year or two ago? Chris Swift : Yes, I don't want to speculate. I don't want to say I really don't know, honestly, Josh. So you'll have to ask them that. I know what we're trying to do every day. Again, we want to be thoughtful. We want to compete. We want to maintain our margins. And I've said this before, you of all people know it and get it. I mean we're making three to five year rate guarantees depending on product line, and we can't go upside down with those types of guarantees out there. So we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined and try to do the best we can, but there are certain lines that we're just not going to cross. And so all I could say is, yes, we want to be relevant. We are relevant in the marketplace. There isn't a national account opportunity that doesn't come our way, and we're going to compete thoughtfully, but we're also willing just to put the pencil down and say that's enough. Joshua Shanker : Thank you for all the answers. Operator : Our last question will come from Alex Scott from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Alex Scott : All right. Thanks for taking me in. So I wanted to ask about property pricing, actually. I thought it was pretty striking at the small to mid-area anyway, the pricing is still pretty elevated. Can you talk about some of the dynamics there that are allowing for that kind of price action when we're seeing sort of the larger, more global property into things, it's slowing down more significantly. Chris Swift : Yes. Alex, let me just give you a data point or two and then ask MO to add his color. Our total property capabilities spread across all our businesses, ex-Global Re, pricing actually accelerated 60 basis points during the quarter from 12.2 to 12.8. And I would say the two largest segments from a premium volume sort of led the way. Spectrum pricing is up 60 basis points also to 17.6, and our general industry property capabilities is up another 60 basis points to 8.5%. So again, feel really good as far as our sweet spot of being in that SME space and pricing remaining firm and actually expanding a little bit. That's not true in some of the larger, large property or E&S. MO, but what would you just add to your color? Morris Tooker : No. And I think we're watching the reaction to the storms and trying to understand how that impacts the marketplace and certainly the reinsurance renewals. But generally, it's a favorable market that we would look to take advantage of. Alex Scott : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe if I could sneak one last one in. Just when I think through the A&E reserve review in 4Q? I know you're probably not ready to give like a number or something like that. But could you help us think through like some of the underlying trends you see with those claims and so forth. They could help us at least directionally understand which way things are going there? Chris Swift : I'll let Beth add her color. But Alex, we need to finish the review the study. I mean, we'll announce it, obviously, with fourth quarter, but there's nothing to speculate right now because we haven't completed our work. Beth Costello : Yes, I would agree with what Chris is saying. We'll complete the study and report on the trends and underlying exposure that we see there at that time. Alex Scott : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Susan Spivak for any closing remarks. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions, and have a great weekend. Operator : This concludes today's conference call webcast. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Swift: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before beginning, I want to take a moment to address the recent wildfires that have devastated the Los Angeles community. Our thoughts are with all those impacted by this tragedy. Our team on the ground is working tirelessly to help our customers rebuild and recover, and I thank them for their dedication. After Beth and I summarize our outstanding fourth quarter and full-year results, we will then be joined by our business leaders for a Q&A session, including Mo Tooker, who was appointed President, effective tomorrow, February 1. Mo will lead all our P&C businesses and will be responsible for stewarding several enterprise-wide initiatives. Mo is an exceptional leader with a strong reputation for strategic growth, customer-focused solutions, underwriting discipline and building a cohesive culture. He is ideally suited to step into the President role, as we advance our growth and innovation strategy aimed at addressing our customers\u2019 changing needs. So let\u2019s get started. Our fourth quarter results capped off another outstanding year of financial performance and strategic achievements. These results highlight the strength of our franchise, particularly our exceptional underwriting execution, extensive distribution relationships and an unparalleled customer experience. I wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks to our dedicated employees. Your unwavering commitment and hard work are the driving force behind our success. Reflecting on some key achievements from 2024 for both the quarter and the year. Topline growth in commercial lines was 6% for the quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.1%. For the year, growth was 9% and the underlying combined ratio of 87.9 was consistent with prior year. Personal Lines achieved 9.3 points of underlying combined ratio improvement in the quarter, including over 10 points in auto. For the year, Personal Lines delivered an underwriting gain, including an auto underlying loss ratio that was one point better than our expectations. We continue to achieve strong renewal written pricing increases across P&C during the quarter, including notable double-digit increases in commercial and personal auto, commercial property, homeowners and general liability. Group Benefits delivered an impressive core earnings margin of 7.8% for the quarter and 8.2% for the year, led by strong life and disability results. And, our investment portfolio continues to generate solid performance. All these items contributed to an outstanding core earnings ROE of 16.7% for the year. Let me dive deeper into the performance of each of our businesses. Our Commercial Lines business achieved significant topline growth, while maintaining highly profitable underlying margins. Written premium growth was driven by strong pricing increases across most lines, double-digit new business growth in our SME focused business and exposure growth that continues to benefit from a resilient economy. As expected, underlying margins for the year were consistent with 2023, reflecting our steadfast commitment to disciplined underwriting, while sustaining industry-leading performance. Favorable underwriting results in property along with strong renewal written pricing execution across all lines offset industry-wide elevated liability severity. Beth, will provide specifics around prior year development in her comments, but I wanted to take a moment to address our general liability reserves. Based on our fourth quarter review, we have strengthened our general liability reserves by $130 million before tax. We believe that we have addressed the most recent trends and have adjusted our ultimate losses accordingly, reflecting the potential for increasing settlement costs due to a higher percentage of attorney representation across all claim sizes and the rise in average settlement rates. Moving into each of our Commercial Lines businesses. Small commercial remains the cornerstone of growth and profitability for The Hartford, setting an industry standard that is difficult to replicate in the market. I\u2019m very pleased to share that for the 6th consecutive year, Keynova Group has ranked The Hartford as the number one Small Commercial carrier in overall digital capabilities and important competitive advantage in this market. Our top ranking reflects our commitment to providing exceptional functionality, ease of use and unparalleled support and access to our agents and customers. Our financial performance reflects this top ranking, where we achieved a record breaking written premium of $5.5 billion in 2024, including $1.1 billion of new business, while extending a decade long trend of annual sub-90 underlying combined ratios. With another year of exceptional results and relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our Small Commercial business. Our Middle & Large Commercial organization continues to demonstrate strong growth and underlying profitability. We are capitalizing on elevated submission flow, driven in part by our strategic investments to expand product capabilities and enhance the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Our investments in Middle & Large Commercial position us well to drive additional topline growth and deliver exceptional results. While fourth quarter new business was slower than previous quarters, full-year performance included strong topline growth and an underlying margin that remained below 90. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution and a 16% increase in Middle Market new business with robust growth across nearly all product lines, led by construction and marine. In 2025, we expect to sustain our track record of delivering meaningful growth with underwriting discipline. Global Specialty had an exceptional year, maintaining excellent underlying margin performance in the low to mid-80s for the past three years. Our competitive position, breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove strong gross written premium growth and record new business. This expansion was fueled by significant contributions from Global Re and our wholesale business. We remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and across Global Specialty with execution that has never been stronger. The transformational work we have done over the last five years has put us in a strong position to accelerate our market-leading competitive advantage, driven by technology, data science and an experienced workforce. Whether in standard lines or E&S lines, we are gaining market share due to our unique underwriting capabilities and strong distribution relationships. Across Commercial Lines, our continued emphasis on property expansion generated 16% premium growth this year. We achieved our full-year goal ending the year with $3 billion in written premium and plan to continue building on this success in 2025. We remain confident that the market conditions support earning strong risk adjusted returns through disciplined underwriting, while maintaining a stable approach to catastrophe risk management. Despite industry-wide elevated catastrophe losses, we are proud that our full-year cat ratio remained flat with 2023 even with our significant property portfolio expansion. Moving to pricing. In Commercial Lines, renewal written pricing in the quarter excluding workers\u2019 compensation of 9.7% was up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. All in, ex-comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remained comfortably above loss cost trends. Workers\u2019 compensation pricing was slightly down sequentially. As we look to 2025 pricing, we are focused on keeping pace with loss cost trends. Across Commercial Lines, with our diversified and expanding product portfolio and innovative mindset, we are primed to continue to grow market share at highly attractive margins. Turning to Personal Lines. 2024 was a transformative year, positioning us well for the future. We have positioned the business with new products and capabilities, revamped our operating routine and equipped ourselves with data and technology resources. We have faced business and environmental challenges with unparalleled determination and I want to recognize the team\u2019s hard work and commitment to our vision and strategy. For 2024 in auto, we achieved significant rate increases across the book, driving an overall auto underlying loss ratio improvement of 7.3 points over a point better than the high-end of our expectations. As a result of the significant written pricing actions that we\u2019ll earn into the book, combined with moderating severity trends, we expect continued underlying combined ratio improvement to reach the mid-90s during 2025. Our homeowners business had an exceptional year highlighted by an impressive underlying combined ratio for the quarter, the best we\u2019ve seen in over a decade and a slightly improved cat ratio in a year of elevated industry catastrophe losses. Pricing remained strong all year, outpacing underlying loss cost trends. Substantial investments have significantly improved price to risk matching and enhanced underwriting capabilities that are benefiting the homeowners book more broadly. With our rates in insurance to value keeping pace with loss trend, we are confident about our strong position in the market. Turning to Group Benefits. Our strong core earnings margin in 2024 demonstrates focused execution, a resilient economy, improved mortality trends and continued strong disability results. Group life mortality trends were favorable, though they are expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels. The full-year disability loss ratio of 68%, primarily reflects favorable long-term disability trends, offset by pressure in paid family and medical leave products. These leave products are highly utilized and valued by employees and we are implementing the necessary rate and underwriting actions to improve the margins. Overall, the benefit landscape is evolving with increased awareness of features and benefits, which is positively impacting our supplemental products, such as critical illness, hospital indemnity and accident. We continue to expect the Group Benefits market to remain dynamic with digital transformation, product innovation and increasing customer demands. As a result, we are investing in this business and have a clear roadmap that I am confident will only strengthen our market leadership position. Looking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales during 2025 and are off to a solid start. Core earnings margins in recent years have exceeded our long-term targets. However, we continue to expect a core earnings margin of 6% to 7% in this business with disability incidence trends returning to historic levels. Moving to investments, the portfolio continues to support The Hartford\u2019s financial and strategic goals, performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details. In closing, excellent fourth quarter results capped a year of outstanding financial performance, positioning us to sustain consistent and superior results in 2025. I remain incredibly optimistic about our future, because 2024 financial results have showcased the effectiveness of our strategy and the value in our ongoing investments. Commercial Lines continues to maintain excellent underlying margins, while delivering robust topline growth. Group Benefits core earnings margin remains outstanding. We have achieved key milestones in our Personal Lines journey and plan to return auto to targeted profitability by mid-2025. Investment income remained strong, supported by attractive yields and a diversified durable portfolio of assets and share repurchases and dividends remain our primary capital management tool. As our businesses continue to generate excess capital, we will proactively manage capital resources to further drive shareholder value. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter. Beth Costello : Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $865 million or $2.94 per diluted share with a full-year core earnings ROE of 16.7%. Commercial Lines had a strong quarter with core earnings of $665 million written premium growth of 6% and an underlying combined ratio of 87.1. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 9%, including 22% new business growth and an underlying combined ratio of 86.7%. This is the 18th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio below 90%. Middle & Large Commercial had another quarter of strong profitability with an underlying combined ratio of 90.2, slightly improved from the prior year and written premium growth of 5%, reflecting lower new business as we remain disciplined, particularly with elevated general liability severity loss trends. Global Specialty\u2019s fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was an excellent 83.6 with record earned premium of $865 million. Written premium growth of 3% in the quarter reflects lower new business in primary and excess casualty and from our Global Reinsurance business, which declined 14% primarily due to lower premium in Latin America. Global Specialty written premium, excluding Global Re, was up 6%. In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter increased to $155 million including the first underwriting gain in two years with an underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, driven by a 17.3 point improvement in the loss ratio over the prior year. The fourth quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 103 improved 10.5 points from the 2023 period, and Homeowners produced an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 61.7. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 12% in the fourth quarter, in part driven by steady and successful rate actions. In Auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 19.1% and earned pricing increases of 21.9%. In Homeowners, written pricing increases were 13.9% and 14.9% on an earned basis. Additionally, new business growth was robust in both Homeowners and Auto, with Homeowners more than doubling to $59 million and Auto increasing by 18% to $77 million. The Personal Line\u2019s fourth quarter expense ratio of 26.5 increased from the prior year by 1.9 points, primarily driven by higher direct marketing costs, higher staffing costs and higher commissions, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premium. Total P&C net unfavorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $97 million before tax, primarily driven by $141 million of Asbestos & Environmental Development. Excluding the A&E development, core prior accident year net development was favorable by $44 million due to reserve reductions in workers\u2019 compensation, catastrophes, bond, professional liability and personal auto, partially offset by increases in general liability and commercial auto. As Chris mentioned, we strengthened our general liability reserve this quarter by $130 million before tax. This included strengthening to the 2015 to 2018 accident years driven by higher than expected construction defect claim activity in those years. In addition, across our general liability lines, we strengthened the incurred but not reported reserves for more recent accident years as we observed an increase in severity on reported claims above our expectations and anticipate a higher claim severity trend on unreported claims as the industry continues to face increasing settlement costs with rising attorney representation rates and higher average settlement rates. We completed our A&E reserve study in the quarter, resulting in an increase in reserves of $203 million comprised of $167 million for Asbestos and $36 million for Environmental. As I mentioned, $141 million impacted core earnings and $62 million was recorded as a deferred gain, exhausting the ADC cover we have for A&E. As a reminder, we have recorded a total of $850 million before tax as a deferred gain within other liabilities for A&E as of December 31. For our Navigators ADC, in 2024, we have amortized $145 million of the total $209 million deferred gain. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect the remaining balance of $64 million to be amortized in 2025. This will positively impact net income and have no impact to core earnings. With respect to cats, P&C current accident year catastrophes in the fourth quarter were $80 million before tax, which was essentially flat to the prior year and included $68 million from Hurricane Milton as well as net reductions for cats incurred earlier in the year of $18 million. For the year, cats totaled $768 million. We continue to actively manage our cat exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher risk areas. Additionally, we have a robust and comprehensive reinsurance program on both a per occurrence and aggregate basis. In terms of our catastrophe reinsurance program renewal on January 1, we were very pleased with the placements and terms and conditions for our programs. Our expiring core per occurrence catastrophe protection was renewed an approximate 10% decrease in cost on a risk adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information compares favorably with the overall market and speaks to the quality of our underwriting, strong reinsurer relationships and favorable experience. Additionally, we continue to strategically leverage the combination of traditional reinsurance capacity with the sponsorship of our catastrophe bonds, Foundation Re, to ensure robust and diversified protection for our portfolio. As of January 1, after the reset of our catastrophe bond, our occurrence program provides protection from peak peril up to a gross loss event of $1.5 billion. The majority of that protection is secured on a multi-year basis. We also renewed our aggregate treaty under the same structure and at a favorable decrease in cost on a risk adjusted basis. The continuing strength and diversification of our property, occurrence, and aggregate protections aligns with and supports our strategic growth in property writings. Although it is too early to estimate the potential losses from the current California wildfires, we are closely monitoring the situation in areas where we have insured properties and businesses at risk. Our occurrence reinsurance program includes coverage for wildfires that attaches at $200 million and exhausts at $1.2 billion. Our reinsurance program does include provisions allowing a combination of events subject to hours and radius provisions. We have summarized the catastrophe reinsurance programs within the slide deck. Moving to Group Benefits, we achieved core earnings of $139 million for the quarter. The core earnings margin of 7.8% for the quarter reflects improved life results and continued strong disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 66.9 compared to 63.6 in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products and slightly higher LTD incidents in 2024 after two years of all-time historically low incidents, partially offset by favorable long-term disability claim recoveries. The group life loss ratio of 79.9 for the quarter improved 3.1 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. The Group Benefits expense ratio of 26.7 increased 2.5 points for the quarter, reflecting higher staffing costs and increased investments in technology. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $68 million combined with increased exposure on existing accounts and excellent persistency above 90%, resulted in a 1% growth in fully insured ongoing premiums. Turning to investments, our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. For the quarter, net investment income was $714 million. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.6% before tax, 10 basis points above third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher reinvestment rates and accretive trading activity earning into the portfolio. The fourth quarter reinvestment yield continued to exceed the sales and maturity yield. Looking forward to 2025, we expect net investment income, excluding LPs, to be higher, driven by an increased level of invested assets resulting from continued growth and anticipate yields to be marginally higher than 2024. As expected, our fourth quarter annualized LP returns of 6.4% before tax were higher than previous quarters. We continue to anticipate LP returns to improve in 2025, exceeding 2024 on a full-year basis. Turning to capital, as of December 31, holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion. For 2025, we expect net dividends from the operating company of approximately $2.5 billion a 9% increase over 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the first quarter. As of year-end, we had $3.15 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026. To wrap up, 2024 business performance was excellent and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to, Susan. Susan Spivak Bernstein : We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Kligerman from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, good morning. First question, and hate to even bring this one up because the quarter was so darn excellent, but the prior year development of general liability a $130 million, could you break out that mix between the \u201815 and \u201818, underwriting year construction defect policies versus the, IBNR on the more recent accident years? What was the mix there? And then with that, really curious about how confident going forward you won\u2019t likely need to take other GL charges because, I think with construction defect policies, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the pricing now is much higher for labor and material loads, as that\u2019s probably the reason for 2015 to 2018 charges. So, I\u2019m kind of curious on, construction defect in particular, but I think those are much tighter policies today. Christopher J. Swift: Andrew, thank you for joining us for the question. Let me give you some context and then I\u2019ll ask Beth to add her commentary on the splits by year. So, you\u2019re right, we made a move on our reserves and added $130 million in PYD across number of accident years in Product Lines. And, we also did a little move in commercial auto. So, I think what I really want you to know and you said it, with this move and Beth will explain more on some of the approach changes that we made this quarter, I feel highly confident that we put a good, if not all, a good chunk of this behind us. And, we\u2019ve been working hard at getting our reserves right every quarter, but more importantly pricing our products for the new trend to make sure that we\u2019re improving our economics into the extent possible. So, on the PYD side, I\u2019m highly, highly confident. I think the implication though there is, we also then needed to take a move on our 2024 accident year where we added about one point on a year-to-date basis to our expectations for GL. So, we needed to then true-up 2024. And then as we looked at 2025, I could share with you that we have these higher loss cost trends in our assumptions. The team, our underwriters are already reacting with increased pricing, really effective one-one and will continue throughout the rest of the year. So comprehensively, I feel like we got our arms around it and are hitting the ground running as hard as we can in 2025. And, if I put that all in context for you Andrew, of all people gets it is, I do believe we can generate margins that are consistent with 2024. And, that\u2019s ultimately the proof of all our actions, all our strategies, all our ability to execute at a high-level. And, I think that\u2019s an important data point for you and others to hear. So, I\u2019ll ask Beth to do the splits and any other commentary she\u2019d like to make. Beth Costello : Yes. Thank you, Chris. So, as it relates to the liability reserve increases between sort of the older accident years, the \u201815 to \u201818 and then more recent years, I\u2019d say the split is roughly half-and-half. And Andrew, I would agree with your characterization on the older years that that really is related to sort of increased costs that have happened. Think of sort of post-COVID and the inflation that we\u2019ve seen. That really is related to legacy book. And, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019ve made adjustments to those reserves. That\u2019s a book that we\u2019ve done significant re underwriting on and really feel that\u2019s contained in those years. The more recent years that activity I would characterize is more related to social inflation. And, as it relates to how we approach the reserve increases this year, this quarter, I would say we did a little different approach. In the previous quarters when we had PYD in the general liability lines, we were reacting to the elevated activity we were seeing. We were adjusting that accordingly. And, if we had followed that same approach this quarter, I think our reserve strengthening would have been more consistent with what we saw in previous quarters. But given that it was another quarter of this elevated activity, this quarter not only did we react to the observed activity, we also increased our severity assumptions going forward for unsettled and unreported reserves resulting in a larger increase to IBNR. And as Chris said, we also incorporated these estimates into our 2024 accident year. So, when we step back, when we look at the actions that we took for prior years, the actions that we\u2019ve taken in the current year, we think this positions us very well going into 2025 both in terms of the overall adequacy of our GL reserves. And equally important and Chris comments on this, but I want to reemphasize it, these trends are incorporated into our pricing models going forward and that\u2019s what our business leaders are executing on with the goal of getting pricing increases above these loss trends. Andrew Kligerman : Very helpful. And, just quickly on net written premium in commercial. Small Commercial was a really strong 9%, Mid Large was 5%. And I think last year, there was kind of a disconnect on, or there was some underperformance of some of your competitors and you were able to capitalize. So, I want to understand, do you still have that momentum in Small Commercial in that upper-single-digits? And then, with Mid to Large at 5%, I think in the past, Mo has talked about the lower-end of Mid being pretty robust, just like Small Commercial. So, how sustainable is the mid-single-digit in Mid, Mid Large net written premium growth? Christopher J. Swift: Andrew, I\u2019ll start and then ask Mo to comment. So, I think on an overall basis, if you look at the components of commercial, particularly on a year-to-date basis, we feel really good about the growth, the execution, how we\u2019re capturing additional market share. So, nothing philosophically is going to change in our approach other than we just need to continue to be disciplined from an underwriting side. And yes, from quarter-to-quarter you could have some variations, it\u2019s a competitive marketplace, others might lean in a little bit more to us. But, I really would want you to know. Yes, we want to grow and capture more market share and serve more clients and serve more of our agency needs, but only in our terms and conditions and with the proper underwriting and proper pricing. And, I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s reflected in this quarter. But, Mo, what would you add? Morris Tooker : Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll take it a little bit deeper, Andrew. I would say that the Small Commercial just had a terrific year, I think 9% overall, new and renewal strong, the flows continue to be really good. And, this is especially in the face of some disruption around us over the past couple of years, and I think the team has really been measured in the way they\u2019ve grown so that we can be consistently growing going forward. So, I think really what you saw in the quarter was our strategic advantage is showing through. That\u2019s our investments in technology, helping the customer and the agent get things into the system easier to data advantage. And then all on top of that for small, I think we just had a really good year on the E&S binding front and they will continue to push into the E&S space, because we think we can bring our same strategic abilities into that space. Middle & Large Commercial is a little bit of a different story. We\u2019re really happy there too with the 9% for the year, but the market is competitive and the team there has really tried to stay disciplined. And, what we saw in the quarter was a little bit more of a competitive market, especially in the workers\u2019 comp, the GL and the umbrella space. And, we\u2019re just going to make choices on that and that\u2019s what the team did. I was really proud of what they did. But I will kind of echo Chris\u2019 comments. I think it\u2019s an out of pattern quarter. We still see submission flow really good into the Middle & Large Commercial space, especially in the lower-end to your point. The market is broadly supported from a pricing perspective. And again, the investments that we\u2019re making in that space, we\u2019re trying to take all that advantage we have in Small into the Middle space. And we think that just allows us to gain market share in the Middle Market space over time. So again, I think two different stories, but confident about our ability to grow it and grow market share over time. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Good morning. First one to, Beth, I was trying to get a baseline on kind of what the underlying loss ratio looks like in Commercial Lines with some of the antidotes you were talking about. So, what was the kind of favorable non-cat kind of property loss? And then, any current year development when you increase at IBNR anything from 2024 that may have impacted it? Christopher J. Swift: Brian, if I understand your question and Beth can add her commentary. I think what I said in my commentary was for the GL line, it was a one point true-up on a year-to-date basis for the elevated combined ratio given some of the things we just talked about from PYD, it\u2019s probably 2.5 points in the quarter on a comparable basis year-over-year. And then, you\u2019re also asking about property, I think I heard. Brian Meredith : Yes, yes. I think you mentioned that non-cat weather was a little bit favorable this quarter. Christopher J. Swift: Right. So, I know you\u2019re jumping and trying to get numbers from me. So I would say, yes, I would say on a year-to-date basis compared to prior year, our non-cat property experience is about 0.9 point better than we than prior year. And from an expectation side, it\u2019s probably 1.5 points, a little better than our expectation. But, Beth? Beth Costello : No, I would agree with that. And as you know, a non-cat property can obviously bounce around quarter-to-quarter. But, looking at the numbers that Chris just quoted relative to the prior year, I\u2019d also say that we did take underwriting actions in \u201823 on our property book. So, some of that we would expect would continue to benefit. Brian Meredith : Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And then I\u2019m just wondering, is it possible to give us a little more color on perhaps exposure to the LA wildfires here kind of what your share in the area is? Do you have commercial exposure with your Small Commercial business? Do you think you\u2019re going to hit your cat reinsurance programs here? Christopher J. Swift: Yes, I\u2019m going to, Beth and I tag team and I would say, I think you\u2019re very observant that this is for us going to be both a Commercial Lines event and a Personal Lines event. If I look at our Personal Lines market share for home and auto and because obviously some cars will also be damaged, we\u2019re less than 1%. We\u2019ve managed California very tightly, I would say over the last seven or eight years Beth with concentrations of risk that we had in certain zones that we needed to remediate. So, Personal Lines obviously what will have some losses. And then, our bigger market share is in our Middle Market book and our BOP product, Small Commercial. So, we do have larger market share there. We\u2019ll have to see how things develop. And, we just been recently been able to get on-site and start to do more inspections. We have our reinsurance business that will have a little bit exposure and then we\u2019ll have to see what the FAIR plan does with any assessment. So, instead of just putting numbers out, we really wanted to just be more deliberate and thoughtful and when we\u2019re ready, Brian we\u2019ll share with you what we believe and see. So Beth, what would you add? Beth Costello : Yes. So again, maybe to put it in context as you asked to our reinsurance program. As we sit here today and we look at our exposures, as I said in my prepared remarks, our first part of our per occurrence coverage starts at losses once they\u2019ve reached $200 million. So that first layer, we have $150 million of protection in excess $200 million and we retain 60% of that, 40% of that is reinsured and very likely that we will be in that layer. The next layer then comes in at $350 million. That layer again provides $150 million excess of $350 million. We retain 25%. We reinsure 75%. Sitting here today, it\u2019s not entirely clear that we\u2019ll be at that level. We could very well be below that. Again, all of that would exclude Global Re. Global Re has its own retrocession program. That program attaches when U.S. property losses hit $60 million and right now we\u2019d expect to be below that. So, hopefully that gives you some context of just how we\u2019re framing it. And, the last thing I\u2019ll just remind you of is that, as it relates to wildfire losses, up to losses of $350 million excluding Global Re, those losses would count towards our aggregate treaty, which again attaches similar to last year at $750 million. Brian Meredith : Great. Great color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on group disability. The loss ratio kicked up by three points from last year. I was hoping to get a sense how much of that was driven by paid family and medical leave versus higher LTD incidents? Christopher J. Swift: Elyse, thanks for joining us. I would say when we characterize our LTD excuse me, our disability book, it includes both the LTD portion, the STD portion and then obviously some of our new paid medical and family leave products. So, on a call it year-over-year basis, I would say that the PFML incident trends that are elevated is creating three points of that difference. Our long-term disability incidences, one point and then the offset to that is our recoveries or terminations are probably one point better. So, that\u2019s the step between years I would have you to think about. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then, my second question is on the kind of the high-level view you provided on Commercial Lines for 2025. Chris, I think in response to an earlier question, you said kind of like flat, underlying combined ratio and you pointed to that contemplating continued higher GL picks. But, then you guys did say that there was 1.5 points of favorable non-cat in \u201824. So, you assuming that, that normalizes like and reverses in your outlook for flat margins in 2025? And is there anything else we need to think about kind of when thinking about commercial margins in 2025? Christopher J. Swift: Yes. I would say, again, you heard it right. I think we\u2019re ending the year at 87.9 on an underlying combined ratio in Commercial Lines. And I think we can produce a consistent result in 2025. That\u2019s what I want you to hear. And, if you want to do all the pluses and minuses by product line and things like that, I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m going to tell you that, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to deliver in totality with a diversified product line point of view, executing strongly, particularly in the general liability lines. And, if there\u2019s returns to normal or if there\u2019s additional benefits that we\u2019re able to get that will all be part of the results that we\u2019ll communicate quarterly to you on it, but I\u2019m not going to get into a reconciliation by product line. Elyse Greenspan : Got it. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Bob Huang : Hi. You might have addressed this, so apologies if this is a little redundant. So, if we think about the GL reserve charge this quarter and the two smaller ones in prior quarters, can you maybe help us get a sense of how much of loss picks would have gone up from the initial loss pick assumptions for the year, like just for the entire book? Yes, that will be the first question. Christopher J. Swift: Yes, I think Bob, thanks for the question. It\u2019s actually a good one. All I\u2019m going to ask you to do is wait until we file the 10-Ks and Schedule P\u2019s and you\u2019ll see it there, Beth, you want to add any color right now. But I would say that the overall trends, Bob, that we\u2019ve talked about as far as attorney rep rate, slip and falls in certain areas, just the dollar levels of to settle some of these cases, the time limit demands that the Planet Bar uses to sort of jam us. I mean, that is generally consistent and nothing\u2019s changing. And as Beth said, what we did take is just a more holistic approach to estimating that these trends most likely will continue and that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in the charge. But, I\u2019d ask you just to wait for the K and the Schedule P\u2019s to be filed and you could see those trends. Bob Huang : Okay. Got it. My follow-up is Group Benefits. One thing you previously said was moderating incidents and fast claims recovery really drove a lot of the outperformance in the prior quarters, especially in long-term disability. Now, it does look like it\u2019s changing this quarter to be a more normalized trend. Is there like how should we think about what is a normal run rate for that long-term disability business in terms of incidence and claims recovery knowing that the last two years was abnormally low? Christopher J. Swift: Yes. I\u2019ll do my best to try to explain that to you. And then, I\u2019m going to ask Mike Fish to add his commentary. I would first start with saying that, remember, lot of our LTD, our clients and policies have 90 day or even 180 day elimination periods. So, really the last two quarters of the year, we\u2019re not out of elimination periods, and we\u2019re still sort of in pick. And, when we look at sort of trends in totality, those were some of the judgments we always make. And from quarter-to-quarter, we might make judgments that are different on what\u2019s emerging versus what\u2019s still in pick. So, I would say though that overall, over the last two years, our disability incidence trends have been like at all-time lows and rock bottoms. And, what we\u2019re beginning to reflect now is just a, I\u2019ll call it a more normalized return to mean assumption, so that we don\u2019t get caught short in any of our reserving positions here. So, those are the two components I would share with you and I\u2019ll ask Mike to add any of his color. Mike Fish : Chris, I think you captured that well. The only couple of items that I would add to your point on what we saw with historically low incidence levels and that was early back in 2022 and 2023 accident years. And, when we look at that and we look at where we\u2019re running more recently, I would say our recent experience you\u2019re seeing here in the quarter would correlate back to about a five year average of incidence historical sort of average. And, that\u2019s about where we set our pricing. So as you know, we\u2019ve got rate guarantees generally two, three or maybe beyond three years. So, we\u2019re looking at a longer-term average around both incidence and recovery. So again, I just leave you with incidence rates more recently trending back to a historical five year average. And then, our recovery experience has been very favorable. Our team does an outstanding job on the claim side and we expect to see strong performance moving forward. Bob Huang : Okay. Thank you for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you, Chris, Beth for all the detail on the cash flow stuff. One more question, it\u2019s more philosophical. I think that you\u2019ve gotten yourself comfortable that you\u2019ve put this issue to bed. Generally, putting something to bed means that you\u2019ve put a layer of caution on top of something beyond your best actuarial estimate of where it is, so you don\u2019t have to revisit that again. But, I know that you\u2019re always trying to get to the best number. In the grand scheme of things, $130 million is not a lot of reserves given the size of your general liability book. Have you done something differently other than given the data you have gone to the most precise number you can? Or have you put a layer of caution on top of the number? Beth Costello : Well, Josh, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call it caution. But as I said in my response to the first question, we did evaluate the reserves a little differently this quarter. And, that\u2019s why the reserve charge was higher than what you\u2019ve seen in previous quarters. So, I\u2019ll leave you with that. That was how we have evaluated sort of the current trend and an expectation that that trend will continue. We have included that in our estimate for prior accident years. We\u2019ve built that into our call for the \u201824 accident year. And as I said, it\u2019s built into our pricing models, going forward. Josh Shanker : Okay. And then, on the Personal Lines business, I see you\u2019re growing in homeowners, still leading from auto. To the extent that the product design, is it generally designed to be sold as a home auto bundle? And, is there any risk of adverse selection selling monoline homeowners? Christopher J. Swift: Thank you, Josh for seeing the improvement that Melinda and the team have made there. So, I think we\u2019re in a good position. I\u2019ll look to Melinda add her color, but I think right now we probably bundle 75% of our homeowners business with auto. We\u2019re not a big monoline homeowners player. We do it on occasion, particularly as our agency channel is being revived a little bit with an older product. So, that\u2019s what I would say. But Melinda what would you add? Melinda Thompson : Yes, I think we\u2019re really proud of the performance of our home business as evidenced by the results this quarter and on a full-year basis. And, if you look at our home business over a long period of time, we\u2019ve generated combined ratios in the low-90s which really compares favorably to the industry. So, as we think about the performance, the investments we\u2019ve made and the products and capabilities, we believe we can grow the business with our auto and where we write at monoline do so in a way that is judicious and thoughtful. Christopher J. Swift: And Josh, I would just add one last point. I think the team led by our risk management team, our underwriters have really taken to heart modeling sort of on a by payroll basis. All the things that could go wrong from a weather, from an earthquake, from a wildfires as we\u2019re seeing. So, I really have the utmost confidence in the improvements we\u2019ve made one in our modeling, our risk selection, matching price and risk and I\u2019d like the opportunity to continue to grow thoughtfully in the homeowners market because again it\u2019s a needed product. There\u2019s a lot of disruption in those marketplaces, but we\u2019re going to be continue to be cautious and thoughtful, but I think we got a pretty good track record. Josh Shanker : Thanks. I know you\u2019ve been putting in a lot of work. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on the general liability reserves and I appreciate it sounds like you guys took a more proactive approach on the reserves this quarter. I guess, I\u2019m wondering now after the changes you\u2019ve made, what sort of severity assumption you guys are embedding in the reserves on the more recent years? And, what you guys are thinking going forward in 2025? Christopher J. Swift: Yes, David, it\u2019s Chris. I would say in aggregate when you think about sort of liability lines, I would say we\u2019re in low-double-digit range currently. Some of the primary lines of business might be a little lower in our general industries and then the umbrella and the excess might be a little higher sort of even in the 15%, 16% range. But, I would say for the recent year, we\u2019re probably exiting low-double-digits in aggregate, and that\u2019s what we need to react to from a pricing side. That\u2019s already baked into all our pricing models that our underwriters are executing to beginning here in January. And, that\u2019s the mission for next year, particularly in any liability line, including commercial auto. We got to stay up with these elevated loss cost trends. And, I know the team knows how to do that very, very well in an empathetic way, while still taking care of customers and agents. But, we got to protect our margins. David Motemaden : Got it. Understood. And then, just another question and I guess this one\u2019s a bigger picture question just in terms of the reserving process. Could you guys remind me when you first started recognizing this impact of hiring attorney rep? And I guess, have you have you guys changed your approach, to just detecting these trends over the last year or so? I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s been anything that that you guys have done that might be picking up on it a little bit more than in the past. Christopher J. Swift: Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything dramatic. I really thought the question was just meant to torture us David. But, I think our listening post what we\u2019re doing with our claim lawyers, our claim teams in totality, there\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t think we missed per se. I just think it\u2019s a magnitude of sort of some of the strategies that the plant at bars uses particularly with time, bar demands. And again, that\u2019s you get into, if you get that wrong, I mean the potential magnitude is really greater on a claims side. We saw much more, I\u2019ll call it just basic slip and fall activity as we talked about in the past. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that we\u2019re missing. If anything, maybe we were just a little too optimistic on how severe these trends were going to be and how long they were going to continue. But, that\u2019s what I would say. Beth? Beth Costello : Yes. The only thing I would add to that, David, is that last quarter we talked about the fact that we saw activity that was above our expectations. So, the notion around increased attorney rep to increase severity, and some of that was built into our assumptions. It\u2019s just last quarter when we, as Chris pointed out, when we saw actual activity coming in, time limit demand and attorney rep rates changing from what our expectation was, that\u2019s when we made some of those adjustments. And, I think we commented on this last quarter that when we look overall at our general liability business, we\u2019ve definitely seen a decrease in frequency over the last several years. So, that points to a lot of very favorable underwriting actions that we\u2019ve taken. What we were seeing though is that when we broke out the categories of claims into no attorney rep, attorney rep and litigated, all three of those buckets from a frequency perspective were coming down. It\u2019s just that the frequency decrease was higher in the non-attorney, non-litigated bucket than some of the other buckets. And that, again, these claims have seasoned, became more evident in the last quarter or so. David Motemaden : Understood. Thank you. I appreciate that color. Operator : Our last question today will come from Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on your promotion, Mo. In your comments, you spoke about the increase in the expense ratio in Personal Lines. I was wondering if you could unpack what\u2019s going on there a little bit in more detail. Just it\u2019s kind of counterintuitive given the amount of premium and rate increases are flowing through and some of the new business restrictions that have been put in place prior to see your expense ratio going up if that makes sense? Christopher J. Swift: I think Greg, I\u2019ll ask Melinda to add her color. It could be a little bit of mix, right, as we mix in a little bit more agency. And, we\u2019re still investing in the platform somewhat. We\u2019re at the tail end of the direct response rollout of prevail. So, that\u2019s in 45, 50 states. And, we are contemplating a broader agency strategy that we\u2019re spending some money on. Melinda, would you add anything else? Melinda Thompson : Yes, just maybe, sorry, I just want to revisit some of Beth\u2019s comments because she alluded to the themes earlier. In the quarter we were up about two points. That was largely driven by marketing and by higher commissions and the premium growth that we are driving certainly over time and the PIP growth that we are seeing in home that\u2019s all come with investment and new business growth. And so, marketing spend and commissions are the primary driver in the quarter. Gregory Peters : Got it. And, I guess a reserve question, but in an entirely different subject area. Everyone seems to be still taking A&E reserves and this is like this number goes away. Do you have some perspective like on outstanding claim counts as you would think that this would start to subside, it just doesn\u2019t for the industry and for you guys? Christopher J. Swift: That\u2019s a hell of a last question, Greg of the day. So, I would share with you just a high-level observation and Beth can add hers is. I think frequency of claims is coming down, particularly in the MISO area. But, severity is going up as again the plaintiffs is trying to extract the same amount of economics or greater economics per claim than sort of the older days. So, yes, I\u2019m hopeful that at least the frequency trends could continue and we\u2019ll try to manage the severity trends as best way we can. And yes, that\u2019s why we did the A&E cover years ago when we did. Obviously, we fully utilized it, which turned out to be a good trade for our shareholders. And, we\u2019ll just manage it the best we can going forward, but it\u2019s a continuing issue for sure. Beth Costello : Yes, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d add too much to that. I mean, obviously, on the frequency piece, some of it is a little bit of just what our expectations were. So, you might see a little bit of a decrease. We would have expected maybe more. And so, some of that impacts our study each year, kind of where our particular insureds and the insurance that we provide for particular insureds, where that shows up sort of as we do the ground up study by insured and that can change year-to-year. We had a little bit more activity that we saw on accounts where we just had a little bit more exposure than some of the others. And then on Environmental there, we had a little bit of just increase in remediation costs, one coming from a coal ash claim and things like that. So similar themes, I would say, to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks. Operator : We are out of time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Susan Spivak, for closing remarks. Susan Spivak Bernstein : Thank you for all joining us today. And as always, please reach out with any additional questions. We look forward to seeing many of you over the next coming week and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
